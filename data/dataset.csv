3,"The Good:  First off, I usually don't go to shows when I'm in Vegas.  Heck, I usually don't go to shows and I usually just gamble when I'm in Vegas.  This trip was different, it's another story, and what can I say, this show is pretty awesome.  This is actually my first time to a Las Vegas show.  It's pretty much all Beatles music with a Cirque du Soleil performance of their crazy high flying stunts.  There is so much going on that you shouldn't get bored and you'll end up leaving thinking how did they do that?\n\nThe Bad:  The lines, entering and exiting.  It's pretty much near the casino so there are huge bottlenecks.  Security is a bitch, they were busting people left and right for pics or vids.   Don't do it, they will catch you.\n\nThe Ben:  Glad this was my first show.  It was good and I might be convinced to go to another show, just let me get my gamble on first :D"
2,"I think they have every bridal shoe you can find online all conveniently located in this store and what they don't have they are willing to order for you with no hassle. Their prices are average on most things; I was actually expecting a lot more in the way of accessories (guest books, pens, cake toppers, etc.). They did have an okay selection to choose from but I guess I expected a little more from a place calling itself a \""Superstore\"". The attire half of this shop was pretty decent though, they appeared to have an acceptable amount of bridal and wedding party dresses in the store. I'm glad I stopped here, because I got to try on shoes and my mom got a shirt that said Mother of the Bride, but that was pretty overpriced at $40 for a cotton t-shirt with rhinestones on it. Actually, being that we found my mom's dress for the wedding on clearance at JC Penney's, the shirt cost more then the dress! Customer service was okay, but I had a heck of a time hunting down someone who wasn't busy doing something to help me out."
4,"5 stars for a kid's pizza place you say?  Yes, and I will tell you why.  This Peter Piper Pizza location is the best I have been to.  Clean, friendly staff, and great pizza (really!  try the Chicago Classic - yum!).  A good place for both adults and kids to hang out.  They have beer and wine; it's an inexpensive happy hour for the ol' folks!  The gameroom guy treated my children like gold, fixing a broken game promptly & even bumping up their ticket count a bit so my daughter could get a coveted 500 ticket prize.  Management ensured we had a reserved table for the last birthday party we held for 20+ people, and the staff promptly served the pizzas directly to our table (normally you get a buzzer to pick up your own).  You can tell that the staff at this location takes pride in their work and serving the customer.  My family and I are loyal fans!"
3,"Went back to this OG tonight. Interesting show.\n\nAs I was walking up to the table, I saw server Crag (mentioned in my first review) was waiting on the tables around us. So before he could greet us, I said to the others in my party \""we need to get moved to a different section\"". Apparently, the hostess had told someone else in my party that we had a different server, so we settled in and watched to see how things went.\n\nOur excellent server tonight was Kayla. She did a great job. We gave her a diverse set of requests with our order, and she met all of them perfectly. She was attentive, friendly, suggested several upgrades, and generally continued to restore my faith in this location (like Adam and Joey had done before her). Her tip reflected it.\n\nMeanwhile, I watched the tables around us get ignored by Crag again. I thought it was sad that he was still working there, and still meeting his especially low level of expectations that he set for us when we were unfortunately sat in his section. Except this time, there was a manager going around asking the tables if they were happy with their service and food. The tables on both sides of us said the service was really slow and had some other complaints about wrong orders, unfilled glasses, and missing utensils. One of the tables was seated at the same time as us, and in the entire time they were there, Crag showed up exactly twice. The manager had to comp their meal. Not sure how Crag is still working there, especially since there are so many good servers working there, and especially since Crag is costing them money now with his consistently bad performance.\n\nAnyway, the food was good as usual.\n\nI do recommend this location now, and if you ask for Adam's, Joey's, or Kayla's sections, you'll be very happy with the service.\n\nOne last point: kudos to the manager (I didn't get his name, but he had short blonde hair and was a consummate professional); he did a really good job of making the customers happy (especially Crag's victims), and he kept the dining room flowing. Nice work!"
3,"This place could as easily be called \""Cool Bro Burgers\"" - low key atmosphere run by beared men who appeared in their 20's. Service was casual but prompt. This place gets 4 stars for creativity on the menu and 3 stars for execution/taste. The burgers all sound amazing. Mine was an egg and onion concoction. It sounded amazing but was just ok. I wasn't asked how i wanted my burger cooked. It was also gone too quick... I was glad i had ordered the sweet potato tots for an extra $2. They were very hot when served and were great with the jalapeno ranch. I would definitely try this place again because i am so curious about the rest of the menu but i hope to find one more satisfying in taste and bulk."
3,"Yep, I'm a fan! My friend and I drove past this restaurant once and one day decided to give it a shot... She got beef and broccoli and I got beef and green pepper. Beef and green pepper is pretty much just like beef pepper steak. It was only a 15 minute wait, so we went next door to smiths to grab some wine and kill time. After reading reviews, I'm curious as to what 'pho' is and how it tastes... that might be the next thing I try!"
2,"Service was very slow but food was decent...had the bean burrito and cheese enchiladas...local beer tastes like miller, nothing special.  Only option in tortilla flat! Atmosphere is quirky and interesting with western flair and thousands of dollar bills covering interior of entire restaurant!"
0,"Was hoping that this one would be quicker than the one on Flamingo. Given that it was a Sunday and there was only one other customer, we thought we got lucky. Unfortunately, it took quite a bit to flag down the employee and finally make eye contact. I told him we tried to make an appointment but the sprint app is useless and kept erroring out and would not let us login. He said he would be with us in 5 minutes. After 15, we had to give up and leave or we would have been late to work. Now we have to spend the next couple of days with a brand new phone that cannot power on because we cannot spare the hours it takes to go and wait at a sprint store."
3,"Stayed here mid July 2012 on a weekend. I was able to snag a 3 nights for $150 deal through Facebook. Overall I was satisfied with our stay but this hotel seems more like hotel for \""older folk\"". When you first walk you feel like your at a hospital because its really bright and white. The renovations are noticeable and the rooms are comfy. Won a bit of money on black-jack and roulette. The coconut/smoke mixture in the air got annoying after the 2nd day. Resort fee is 15 dollars which is less than a majority of the other resorts. The light let in from the blinds didn't really bug me. I would recommend this hotel if you are on a budget.\n\nPros\n-Check-in was fast.\n-Hotel does not get crowded (like other hotels).\n-Room was nice.\n-Pool area is nice even though it was a mixture of older and younger folk. \n\nCons\n-Our room felt like it was miles from the casino floor.\n-Bathrooms didn't seem so remodeled to me."
2,"The damn resturant is a very good place to eat cheap . The hooter girls are better than the ones we have here.  This place is'nt the first place i would go to gamble that is mgm.  However susan said their where readnecks and was waiting for the tractor pull lol.  Thats funny I live on a farm and still fit in at Pure and tryst with the high end people . Its vegas part of it is that you get to enjoy all types of people. Your proably just mad because those rednecks would'nt give you the time of day.  Hooters looks for rednecks and sports fans, not ho's who spend more money on makeup than blackjack."
0,"It was a late night and we decided to get one more beer and a bit of food. I asked for a recommendation of the best burger, like I do at a lot of places. I was told \""it's really good\"". I said, I asked for a recommendation and Greg said the same thing. The bartender clarified that the name of the burger was called, it's really good. It was like who's on first bit so I played along. Greg then said \""maybe the 5th time is the charm\"". I could tell you about the unwillingness to offer up alcohol info, making fun of another 2 guys who were at the bar, the asking us if we want pepper when we were done already, or the sheer overall uncaring shown to the 6 people to our left and right - but it's late and I need sleep. We got a comment card at the end and I wanted to fill it out, but we weren't given an ink pen - I said, do you want my birthday so I can join your rewards? I was told it's a comment card and they have no idea what the birthday is used for. We then offered up feedback to Greg and the bartender personally. The bartender seemed to care, and he did a pretty decent job. Greg knew we were upset with him and the girls next to us were to. He sat and took it but never apologized or wanted to make it right. We left paying the full bill. This placed opened in December and both of them have been there since the beginning. This place was horrible - I will never come back. And I hope nobody else goes unless something changes in a HUGE way. The names attached to this place made me want to go - food was so average and beer prices were marked up 900% on bottles. Avoid at all costs."
0,Used to dine here a lot. Food is good but the rudeness of the owner Don makes this a no go. He should not take his unhappiness out on the customers
1,"Location is awesome, great view & great people watching on the strip.  But that's where the positive ends.  Don't go here for the food.  Even after not eating all day and being drunk and starving, the food was still horrible - bland, dry, just overall bad (got the chicken burrito per the waitress's recommendation).  \n\nI would only go back for drinks on the patio... take your money elsewhere if you actually want to eat good food."
0,"False advertisement...\n\nSaw a sign outside the hotel \""#1 Buffet in Las Vegas\"" so in my head, i'm thinking this place must be good.\nPaid $30 for dinner - too expensive.\nGroups 8 or more, must pay 18% tip?!\n\nNothing indulgent here - normal buffet food.\nCrab legs tasted stale, creme brulee worst texture ever.\nSaw cotton candy when we came in, and they disappeared by the time my dessert time came around.\n\nThere can be long lines here - don't wait long or else you will be even more mad once you start eating..."
4,"We had sesame ginger, baby rays honey bbq, and kickin bourbon wings. They were very good. The fried pickles spears were good, and so were bacon and cheese potato skins. The pizza was not bad either my 6 year old enjoyed it. The gourmet mushroom burger with a portabello mushroom, lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese was cooked to perfection and the hamburger bun was hot and toasted just right. The ruben was just ok. The vanilla milkshake was really good. Our waitress Ella B. was awesome!"
2,"Certainly not the best breakfast in Charlotte, but there aren't many options in this particular neighborhood.  Skillets subscribes to the \""quantity over quality\"" mentality.  There is nothing \""precious\"" about Skillets-- it looks like a chain and has a typical breakfast/lunch menu that you'd find anywhere else.  Their biscuits were worth the price of admission. I could list a whole bunch of complaints about this place, but in the end their food filled me up and was well cooked, if just a little \""boring\"" tasting.  All things considered, I would go there again.\n\nService was quick and very friendly (to the point of overwhelming).  I had my carry out order in just a few minutes.  Very nice people, they offered me coffee even though I was carrying out an order."
3,"This Wing Stop is huge and conveniently located near UNLV and their wing special on the Tuesday that we went was awesome and totally worth every dollar. They have lots of large TVs for sports viewing needs  \n\nWe came in a big group and they were able to accommodate us surprisingly well. We ordered 3 of the 24piece wing specials that comes with 1pitcher of beer, mozzarella sticks, carrots and celery. And on all 3 orders of the 24piece wings we were able to get different sauces for each set of orders. They made the ordering process easy and it didn't take too long for the food to come out  despite it was a busy sports night during the  basketball playoffs and we were a large group. \n\nGet 4 stars coz even though it's way bigger than most wing stops... Place still feel really packed and crammed... But that's expected from a sports bar."
2,"I went to an event at the new space and was so impressed I had to return. At our event we only had a few choices of beers, so I just assumed that was a limit on the party, not their standard selection. I was wrong. When I returned, they only had a few beers on tap none of which sounded new or different so I returned to the old-standard Copper. I enjoy Copper and all, but part of going to a craft brewery is trying some new varieties...and that's one place I definitely think OMB could improve. \n\nDuring the party the German food was delicious. Like another reviewer mentioned, many of the items were not available and had big red exes over the items. Haven't they been open long enough to offer the entire menu? This time I tried the Caprese Panini and I was underwhelmed. It was really bland and boring and they forgot to put on the lemon aioli. The German potato salad on the side was really good, so stick to the German menu and I don't think you'll be dissappointed. Service was very slow and forgetful. Maybe it's because it's a big place or because it's busy, but she forgot drinks and I had to track down a random busser for my side of aioli. \n\nOn  the positive side, this new venue is absolutely gorgeous and would be perfect for an event large or small. The place itself is five stars worthy.I saw a lot of kids so I'd say it is fairly family friendly considering it's still technically a brewery..\n\nOverall, I will give them another chance...maybe once it quiets down a little bit and they hit their stride."
2,"About 2 rows of stores.  I guess it's a good start.  however, there were only a couple of places to eat and if I'm not mistaken, a Chines place and a pretzel place.  No food court.  That's a big bummer.  \n\nIt's one of those covered out doors outlet.  Very nice for this time of year but it'll still be pretty dang hot in the summer, even with misters, which I'm assuming they  have.\n\nThere is an H&M which is cool but I didn't stop by there ... waaay to many people. I'll spend more time there after the Christmas crowd dies off a bit."
2,"I came here a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend for late night dinner after driving from CA.\n\nAfter reading the reviews and looking at all the pictures I guess I kinda expected to eat around some sort of fire, but I was wrong. The fire is actually in the lounge area which I couldn't go into since I'm not 21. We were seated in the restaurant area which was decorated with lots of plants and flower decor with blue and pink lighting. I expected it to be very blue and pink, but a lot darker, so this was way brighter than I expected. \n\nI ordered the Conquest Sandwich and coffee and my boyfriend ordered a burger with mushrooms ( I dont remember the name). \n\nThe coffee was HUGE, probably as big as a regular soda cup. It was pretty cool for pictures, but since it was so big, by the time I got halfway the coffee would already be cold. \n\nThe mushroom burger came first. It came with a bunch of fries and a side of ranch. The fries was pretty especially with the ranch which was very light, not like most other places with thick fatty ranch.  The burger LOOKED delicious , but it was so soggy and soaked in juices from the sauces and meat that it just fell apart once my boyfriend picked it up. He couldn't even eat the buns anymore because it was just completely soggy, so he just ate the contents of the burger with a knife and fork.  \n\nThe Conquest was pretty good from what I recall. I finished my whole half of the sandwich which me and my boyfriend split. It wasn't as fantastic as I expected from the description on the menu, but it was good. It didn't come with any sides at all, so it was just the sandwich. \n\nThe portions we got weren't worth the price of the food. I expected more for what I paid, especially after reading these reviews. I also expected the food to be a lot better because, yet again, the great reviews. \n\nThe service was alright though. The waitress would check up on us here and there to fill the coffee and water. She'd also check to make sure we had everything we needed. \n\nWe probably won't come back here again. At least not until I'm 21 and can check out the lounge :P"
1,Ok only got a two star cuz I love sephora but I had to hurry and write a review that's how horrible it was at this location ok so they absolutely bug at this location there is nothing wrong with asking if I need help of course if u didn't I would have had a problem but let me tell u that being asked 14 times in a15 min time frame is crazy not only did they follow me around and this lil Mexican lady followed me around acting like she was fixing shelves everywhere I went (ridiculous) btw I'm Mexican ;) so I can say that;) was so irritated I almost wanna call corporate I refused to even purchase anything they betta know I'm a certified V.I.B lol
4,"At first I wasn't sure what I thought of this cirque. I've seen \""O\"" at the Bellagio before, which was just amazing, and which I'd highly recommend.\n\nI recently watched a documentary on the making of \""Love\"" and they said it was not typical of the cirque formula, but instead was more like a musical. I wholeheartedly agree with that statement. I thought it was AMAZING, but very different from other cirques I've seen.\n\nThe music really set it apart, and the creators set out to make the performance enhance the music. There are so many things going on at the same time throughout the performance sometimes it's hard to know where to look! I like how they varied the pace throughout the show, using fast or slow songs, and I also loved the variety of performances. You had acrobats, gymnasts, a section where performers were rollerblading on a ramp...the whole thing felt like sensory overload by the time we left!\n\nI am dying to see this again - we bought the CD when we left, and the way they mixed the music was amazing. If you like Beatles paraphenalia, be sure to check out the Love store. I always find something cool to buy there!"
1,"La Boucherie de Paris me laisse plut\u00f4t sceptique quant aux sandwichs et surtout ceux \u00e0 la viande, viande s\u00e8che et pas forc\u00e9ment des plus fra\u00eeche. Cependant les prix ne sont pas \u00e9lev\u00e9s (environs 5$ pour un sandwich garni), ce qui est avantageux pour les \u00e9tudiants de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, se trouvant \u00e0 deux pas.\n\nPersonnellement, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8rerais payer plus cher et avoir une meilleure qualit\u00e9.\n\nCe qui me r\u00e9jouit par contre, c'est qu'ils disposent d'un beau choix de produits import\u00e9s et principalement fran\u00e7ais tels que petit sabl\u00e9, galette au beurre et autres."
4,Love love this restaurant. Is casual enough that u can dress down but still have a feeling of a fine dining food is excellent and the service is outstanding. Crab cake is my fave!!! Can't wait to go back - yes I've been here more than 5x!!
1,"Not impressed. It looked fun from a newspaper ad but then we got there and it was SUPER EXPENSIVE for a dinky little aquarium. I don't mind paying that kind of money for like a legit aquarium and zoo combination, but it was TINY and it's definitely not worth paying the money. I'd rather spend the $18 adult admission ($13 for children under 12) on something else."
4,"Fourth purchase with superstition jeep and obviously I'm impressed. Charlie and Miguel are quite the team. They cut the BS, got a deal done quick and fairly."
3,"I have read some of the reviews and I feel compelled to write to counter some of the negative statements.  This is not \""the\"" most amazing place for statues or pots.  But it comes close! Some reviewer said that Home Depot had a better selection of pots - I've worked for Home Depot and that is absolutely not true.  HD has only a fraction of what this place carries.  Little Baja is a bit pricey but right now they're having a huge sale so that helps.  I did see a huge area where they set items aside for special order, so I think you can be reassured if you order something you'll get it.  One thing you have to keep in mind is that a lot of this stuff comes from Mexico.  So, things are not going to flow like an American business.  And I suspect that the attitude comes more from the customers than from the workers.  \n\nI have been there recently two times and have been very pleased with the service and the friendliness of the staff.  The only reason why I rated this 4 stars and not 5 is because I wish they carried items made from finer clay like Italian clay pots.  It's a huge, huge area with many pots, fountains, statues, columns, even a gorgeous fireplace mantle made out of marble - really gorgeous.  I have not ordered or bought anything yet, but I don't expect to be disappointed.  Everyone seemed very interested to help.  I will update my review after I purchase my statue.\n\nI am not associated with this establishment in any way or with anyone who works there.  I just moved to LV from LA and am looking for a statue for my courtyard - and I think I found it here!!!"
4,"The first time I was looking to get a dog I initially went to the humane societies near my place in the south west and was told by a lady working there that if I was serious adopting I should consider the animal foundation specifically because they are a kill shelter so I could go down there and potentially save a life.\n\nI've been there many times since then and always found the facilities clean and the volunteers/workers friendly and knowledgeable.  They really want to find homes for the animals, the dogs that are in danger of being put down have extra signs on their kennels pleading with visitors to save them.  I think they try to work with what they have and do the best they can.\n\nThat said both of my dogs are from animal foundation and they are the best dogs.  i wish I could take them all home!  For the adoption fee you get a your animal spayed/neutered, micro-chipped, shots, and a free visit to the vet.  My first dog had an ear infection which they were very upfront about and it was nothing major.  When it came time to get a second dog they were very helpful about finding the right personality to go along with first girl.\n\nI highly recommend this place if you're thinking of a new addition to your family."
1,"4 stars for stock. Negative 2 stars for terrible customer service, and it should probably be more but I'm feeling generous.\n\nI walked in and there was only one other customer in the store. The worker, I'm presuming owner, was in the back playing on her computer. She never once greeted me, asked if I was looking for anything in particular, if I was ready to check out. Nothing. I was invisible, and I was there for about 45 minutes. What the hell. The other customer had to *track her down* to pay, and she didn't seem happy about it. \n\nTheir stock is the only redeeming quality - and I won't lie, compared to some other stores in Vegas, their selection is fantastic. They had not only older novels, but tons of newer novels in great condition. Looking for Game of Thrones? They have about fifteen copies in paperback. They also have an extensive childrens and YA section, which (although I'm twenty two) is a favorite of mine.\n\nI'm surprised this store has survived so long with such terrible customer service.\n\nTip to the owners: SMILE and say Hello to the people who are giving you money! I would have purchased today if I had been greeted even once, or engaged in conversation -- but instead, I left feeling sour. Buying books should not be a negative experience. The reason I don't buy solely online is because I like face to face interaction with other book lovers, but they certainly don't work at this store."
2,"I appreciate the indoor-outdoor appeal of Chelsea's.  It's a little hard to hear if you sit inside, but that just means you can turn your attention to the patio. \n\nI've never loved anything I've ordered, but I have been more than once, so you know the food is still pretty good. Albeit spendy. \n\nChelsea's is one of those places where you can take your parents and your dad will feel comfortable because he recognizes things on the menu, or you can meet your girlfriends for happy hour and everyone will be at peace in their cute shoes sipping cocktails.\n\nLet this place help you make the most of our glorious spring!"
1,"We only go to One World when we're too intoxicated to realize that well, we're at One World. My roommates and I would usually wake up in the morning with a couple plain white cardboard boxes on our living room table with nothing left but grease stains in them. Seems like the $5 dollar pizzas win us over after a long night on Green St.\n\nI have had One World sober. Maybe if I was drunk, it would have tasted better. Not exactly quality ingredients and the bread tastes a little like the white cardboard box it comes in.\n\nOpen basically until the sun rises, it does it's job of satisfying late night hunger. Personally, I'd opt for passing out instead."
4,Fast and friendly service! The food was flavorful and tasted fresh. Service was efficient and atmosphere was lively and great for families or casual dining.  We'll be back for sure!
1,"This was my go to place in north Summerlin when I was too tired to drive to Sushi Mon.  On two of my most recent visits I stopped eating after one piece of sushi because the rice was underdone and inedible.  To add insult to injury they charged my for what I had ordered and was unable to eat.  Over a 6 month period I collected 10 stamps and my next dinner would have been free, but I am so sure I'll be disappointed I don't even want to to there for a free meal!"
3,"Any place that serves the full menu until 2 a.m. is awesome!  Aside from food till 2 a.m. (that's every night by the way), the food is fabulous.  So are the drinks.  I'll admit that I've only ever had the burgers, but damn they're good.  This place is on the pricey side...but who can put a price on a great burger?\n\nAlso, they have a to-go side too!\n\nMake sure to try the red velvet cup cakes, if you still have room after the burger."
0,"I came here just for a haircut. My hair was long, and damaged, hadn't had it cut for awhile. Nevertheless, I had enough to work with. I don't speak French, nevertheless, I said I wanted the dry ends removed and some layers. Pretty standard request. She started cutting from the top and cut it reeeeally short. Then it seemed by the end she realized that it was too short and left the last section at the back long. So now it's like I have a bob with some ratty long ends at the back. My hair is thin, even though I have lots of it, but now all the thickness is in the short hair. Plus it's not even cut evenly anywhere. Looks ridiculous. I will need to style it myself to see if I can fix it. It's not even long enough to stick properly into a ponytail anymore. While she was cutting I could see how much she had snipped off and started thinking to myself, about how long it would take to grow back. My estimation is 1.5 years. She asked if I was ok at this point, obviously seeing the look of despair on my face. I went on a Thursday evening... which is double the price, I thought since they weren't students? I think I thought wrong, save yourself the tears and go somewhere else. And by the way, I waited a week for this appointment."
0,"It is now called Transformations, in Silverado ranch area.\n\nI had high hopes for this place as my first appt. went well.  But then every appt after that, there were issues.  Once again, it's difficult to find a professional black hair salon, where they really care about your hair and desire to help you maintain healthy  hair.\nEvery visit with the stylist was met with 'attitude'.  Ms. M was not open to comments about how I wanted to have my hair done and refused to give any information on the products she used for fear that I would go buy it for at home use.  Isn't that the most selfish, non professional and paranoid position to take?  Mind you I was a weekly client.  The worst thing that happened is she left product in my hair that should have been washed out and my hair started shedding the next morning. I believe this was done on purpose because I had continued to ask her to make sure I was dry before putting heat on my hair.  My mistake was not getting up and walking out with my wet head.  I'd still have my hair if I did."
3,I die for this place.............
0,"Never have I been so dissatisfied with a dining establishment. The only thing more awful than the food, was my server, Lucy. We waited for 30 minutes to be sat (which I was fine with), THEN we waited about 45 minutes for tacos that tasted like they we're fresh  out of the microwave.  Twice, I had to get up to find my server so I could order drinks & both times she seemed like she was bothered. (Do your job girl, then your customers won't have to). I am usually not a tough critic when it comes to resteraunts, or service but senior frogs deserves ZERO stars. The only reason I am even giving them one star is because there is a nice view of the strip outside. Five thumbs down for se\u00f1or frogs."
0,"We were give a gift certificate for this restaurant, and thought we would go for Valentines day. I made reservations a week before at the Sahara location, and called the day before to confirm. When we arrived, there were 4 other couples in the doorway waiting. We stood there for 10 minutes before someone came to the front. BTW, there is no podium or reception area at the front either) Did they greet us? NO. They took one couple to be seated. At that point, another young couple that was waiting, said to us, \""That's the 2nd couple that's been seated since we arrived half hour ago, and we were here before they were. We're appaled and would rather go elsewhere. Good luck to you.\"" We began to wonder if we should stay. We figured we would wait a while longer. After all, it was Valentines Day, where else are we going to get seated at the last minute?\nAbout 15 minutes went by, and no one came to greet us, and there were 2 empty tables. I walked across the room near the kitchen entrance and told one of the employees we had been waiting over 20 minutes, and no one has even aknowledged our presence, and that we had a reservation. Their response was, \"" sorry, it's Valentines Day and we're short staffed.\"" I informed them that was not my problem, and at the very least someone could at least greet us & inform us that they're running behind. Again, the response was, \""Sorry, we're too busy.\"" At that point we left as the other couple behind us did the same.\n\nA week later, we decided to return for my birthday(after all, we had a free gift certificate to use). If I had trusted my instincts the first time, I would've left the certificate on Valentines Day for someone else to use.\nAfter we again waited 10 minutes before someone aknowledged we were even there, we were seated., We were brought a wine list and asked for our drink order. We stated we would have water while we looked over the wine list. The server brought out tapwater with no ice, and a basket of very dry bread. Again, I started to question myself. (Should I go somewhere else?)\nThe salad was served on a warm plate with very runny dressing. My wife asked for her dressing on the side, and of course her salad was drenched instead.\nFor the main meal, my wife had an undercooked piece of fish, and I had overcooked gnocci.\nThis was by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I made sure they were aware of that when I informed them they were not getting a tip. I would stay away from this place. The staff is rude, and they clearly do not care about the customer whatsoever. I'm glad I had a gift certificate, because I most certainly would not have paid for this experience."
3,"The most esthetically pleasing tacos with a delicious list of cocktails. \nPerhaps a bit overpriced, but hey, a girl's got to treat herself once in a while."
4,"Thank goodness for Jack's.  As an outsider, I wasn't sure if I would be able to find a bar I felt comfortable in after one night, but Jack's proved to be the spot.  Both beer and shots were super cheap.  There was a flow of people in and out, but even at its most busiest, I didn't feel like I was being pushed around.  The locals were nice enough, or drunk enough.  You have to love a bartender who wears a Jenna Jameson shirt.  The mix of people in the bar was definitely all over the place.  I was in Pittsburgh one night and I met a real steel worker (yes, in the flesh).  Even at the end of the night when the girls room had puke on the floor, I didn't mind.  It almost made sense to me.\n\nIf I ever come back to this part of Pittsburgh, I will definitely get my drinks at Jacks."
0,"This is the place that I had sushi while I was in Vegas about a year ago that made me feel sick. Just stay away! Everything else seemed rather sub-par even though the selection was fairly large. Not much to say about this place, but...I rather just have a go at Todai instead of this shack. \n\nSave yourself some money and go somewhere else. It's not worth it."
0,"Open 24 hours MY ASS.\n\nI came here with my boyfriend yesterday at 7:30am for breakfast. We decided to come here because they have some island style dishes on their breakfast menu, like Hawaiian French Toast,  Loco-Moco, and Island Breakfast. Unfortunately we never got to try ANY of that because when we got there, the door was locked. There was a buzzer to press to get someone's attention, but they never came, despite the fact that we buzzed FOUR times and waited for 10 minutes just standing there. As we waited, we peered through the windows. There was loud music playing and the lights were all on, but we didn't see a single person. We knew their had to be at least two employees in there though because there was a motorcycle and a silver suv parked right out front and those were the only other cars in the parking lot besides ours. We even went as far as looking up their phone number so we could call them two times, but still, NO ONE ANSWERED. I don't know if the people were sleeping or doing something else, but I really don't think this place should be \""open 24 hours\"" if they won't even open their doors for breakfast!"
4,"We always stay for free.  Can't complain about free.  Super cute asian girl that works at Java Vegas Coffee that used to live in Riverside, CA."
3,"Kitchen Consignment Store to sell lightly used kitchen stuffs and to purchase.  What a great idea!  I popped in today to Kitchen Switchin' just to check it out and see what they have going on... I would like to get rid of a few kitchen things I have and since it is consignment, you can get 45% of the sold price in cash OR 55% of the sold price in store credit.  This is pretty standard in the consignment world.  You have to wait for the item to sell before you reap the rewards.  Although a big reward is paring down at home so that happens instantly when you start getting rid of things that you simply do not use.  \n\nThey have some great stuff!  I wanted a few items, like a fantastic mojito making thing, it was only $6.95.  They also had a Dyson hand vac that I would love to own, that priced out at $79, but retails for WAY more.\n\nAlready getting my things together to bring over and I recommend, you do the same- nothing like making room for MORE!  :)"
0,"Worst place ever! Rude staff and the absolute worst security! The head of security has a superiority complex! How he treated me was uncalled for. Having several security guards man handle a woman on her bachelorette night is beyond ridiculous! Understandable if I was violent but getting kicked out for getting hugs and crying for being emotional from wedding planning after only being in the club for 30 minutes stupid. Kicking me out with none of my belongings and not telling my friends my where abouts. Even when my fianc\u00e9 found out and skipped his bachelor party to come find me they wouldn't tell him! Thanks to these morons I was hand cuffed paraded around the Venetian, I had bruises on my arms and wrists on my wedding day. I will never forgive this place of what humiliation they put me through! Do not go to this club especially if you're a woman! Oh and I also spent $3000 for VIP... To get kicked out after 30 minutes for being emotional! If it was an option it would be negative stars! DO NOT GO HERE!"
0,"You get what you pay for, for sure. A guy at the front desk was unbelievably rude to me the other day. Accusatory, sarcastic...oh, my gosh. Why would such a hostile human being be a presence at the front desk? I think he's an acting manager or some such nonsense. My kids have memberships here... but, personally, I'll never go back."
3,"A 'typical' Irish pub, and I mean that in a good way. We went here for a late evening snack, the place was quite crowded, but we managed to get a table upstairs. Once seated we got quick and very friendly service. We had chicken wings, nothing very exotic, but they came quick and tasted very good. All the time we were seated we got super service from the staff. \n\nA band started to play Irish music downstairs, so after the chicken wings we went down to see the band. And they were really good, playing a mix of Irish folk songs, Irish rock classics and other rock tunes played in an Irish sort of way. Nice! The atmosphere in the pub was genuinely good, and we totally forgot that we were inside a hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nAll in all, this is a place I would like to come back to, anytime."
1,"From the minute you step in the door, it's pretty obvious that this is a chain. The nice thing about pubs in Ireland (lived over in the UK until I was 21, so I've been to a pub or seven) is that they may be owned by one or two brewery's, but they each have their own feel, menu, and clientele. Also, I've never seen a pub in Ireland with the servers wearing Scottish kilts; come to think of it, I've never seen one with the servers wearing Irish kilts either. The place lacked the craic (not a drug, the other kind--fun, enjoyment, abandonment, or lighthearted mischief; often in the context of drinking or music). \n\nWhat I really want to know is what the heck nachos were doing on the menu in a so-called Irish pub. Just because potato wedges were substituted for tortilla chips doesn't mean the dish is now Irish. Oh, and what was up with the Cheese Whizz crap they put on top of them. On the bright side, the boxty wasn't bad--basically stewed beef (cooked with Guinness) in a potato pancake. \n\nSuggestion:  a live, Irish band might make all the difference to D'Arcy McGee's, but I'm not in charge of marketing. In the mean time, if you want a place with a somewhat more traditional Irish pub's atmosphere, go to Rula Bula on Mill Avenue."
3,"The bartenders are very knowledgable about  their beer and provide really helpful tips. I wouldn't recommend this place if you are Miller Lite (or similar)- cost is the same as their craft beers.  Their pizza dough is great, toppings are fresh, wide selection. Only thing is, I'm a sauce person. I like a lot of red sauce on my pizza. They are not heavy with their sauce. Random- their homemade potato chips are great. Also, consider stopping by for trivia Wednesday nights- low tech, but fun."
3,"The Last Drop was the first bar I ever went to in Edinburgh, where I ordered a vodka and coke (standard, the Malibu, Peach Schnapps and Aftershock chaser phase was yet to happen) and sat around staring at people and looking uneasy. What do my alcohol choices  of the nineties have to do with anything you might be thinking? Well, nothing really, I just took the chance to have yet another reminisce about my early drinking years, because the novelty phase when you first start drinking is definitely the best.\n\nAnyway, about the pub, being situated where it is, right in the Grassmarket, Last Drop is part of a busy strip of pubs, which are always heaving with people. Last Drop is a lot cosier and welcoming looking than some of the others, and there are some nice booths to sit down in and settle with a drink for the night. Just a nice wee pub really, no complaints. It will be absolutely rammed during the festival in August, but then again, where isn't?"
1,"We came here last month to watch a boxing event.  The theatre is perfect for that type of event.  The stage is set in the round, so the stage is front and center.  However, the place is old and is in desperate need of a renovation.  The bar and bathrooms are located downstairs underneath the seating area and is very small.  It's a little inconvenient.\n\nThe food and drink options here are very limited as well....think cheap high school gymnasium type of deal.  Also, I wouldn't trust parking my car out in the lot during a show...the neighborhood is bad and sketchy.  The night we went we took an Execucar to/from the place....we didn't want to risk it.\n\nI would only come back to see a show that I don't want to miss...otherwise, I'd pass.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%"
4,"This place is totally rad. \n\nThe beer is great and the food is interesting--I had bison pogos the first time I was there. The patio in the back is comfortable and the inside seating isn't bad. \n\nThe prices match the quality, which is good."
0,"Sbarro... How you disappoint me! So I go to Sbarro after walking the strip in Vegas, and oh man does pizza sound good. We walk in and see the jacked up price, $9.99 for a slice and breadsticks. I got pepperoni and sausage an it tasted like cardboard, and felt like it as well. Also, if it says \""breadsticks\"" on the menu, usually this means more than 1. But I guess at this Sbarro it means only 1, no arguing! All in all very disappointed!"
4,"Consistently delicious, fresh food. Greatest setting on the strip. You can sit outside and watch the action walk right by. The outdoor seating is raised up, so lookie-loos and other freaks can't make eye contact with you or jump the rail! It's pricey, but this is one place where you get what you pay for. Terrific service and high quality drinks from the bar. Don't come to Vegas without hitting this place!"
3,"I regularly visit the place for a 5a7 with lab mates. I recommend starting with the hot dog and pint special. Tasty beer in a large variety for your selection. Inside can get loud, but fret not for there is ample seating outside my friends! Well at least in the summer."
3,"I had dumplings and the Vietnamese style veggie pork skin rice noodle salad. Both were vegan. Both were tasty! The noodle salad was full of surprises. It was a nice mix of veggies, noodles and sauce."
0,"I am totally disappointed. Went to this place, based off the reviews & I was SO excited. I couldn't wait to get my hands on their loved banana creme pie. Got there, they didn't have any. So I asked for a slice of chocolate cake (w/ Nutella mousse) & a brownie parfait. \n\nSorry to say, I am not impressed. What. So. Ever. The chocolate cake is dry. Tastes like it had been sitting out for a few days. The brownie parfait isn't anything to rave about either. \n\nMight I just add - if you have a popular item, it would be a good idea if you had some to sell, especially on the weekend."
0,"Just returned from SoCal Fish Taco Co.  Very disappointing.  Decor and design was interesting, server good, but that's where it all ended.  Don't think much was made from scratch.  Everything tasted canned, salsa, weak cocktail sauce (more like regular ketchup) beans, tortillas......EVERYTHING.  \n\nReally wanted to like this place.  No flavor/seasonings ... Boring.  Wish it was different.  Shrimp tacos and grouper tacos had no flavor at all.  Shrimp had watery/boiled texture.  Not worth it.  Missed opportunity for this company."
3,"Great shop, friendly owners-could spend all day there!"
4,"Great Experience! Overall, the best homemade pastas I've ever had. The best deal was at happy hour, but the portions are over twice as big for dinner. My wife and I had homemade Gnocchi, and homemade ravioli. Both were literally excellent. Fresh, light, delicate, and so flavorful. The bartender, Jimmy, was a real treat as well. Super great service and excellent food will keep us coming back for more."
0,"Went here on a concert night, & they only had 1 bartender only had yuengling on draft, granted they have about 40 drafts. Every other restaurant on the north shore that early evening had at least 3 bartenders."
2,"Being invited to dinner one doesn't have the privilege of choosing the spot so Blu Burger Grille seemed an ok spot to join out of town guests. WRONG...Before I arrived I checked the site out and was disappointed to read an awful review but I went with an open mind.  I arrived before my party and walked into the grille to check it out.  I had to take a step back from the scent of fried oil or so it seemed. The grilles sq. footage is small with patio type tables and booths.  The host or cashier greeted me (chewing gum) and told me to take any seat I liked.  I opted for the outside patio while waiting for my party.  No one even ventured out offering me water nor did they take the time to clean the tables covered with grease. Finally 15 minutes into my wait a server  came out and asked if I wanted a drink. (Maybe he didn't see me at first). With water and a menu before me I browsed to see my options. The menu, original and entertaining, offered Step 1-6 Build Your Burger, clever \""Lettuce\"" build your burger selections, salads, sandwiches and sides. Well guess what, my dinner companions call and ask where I am.  Yep they picked Blu Burger Grille but at The Summit and thank goodness for change of venues.  Like night and day, so was the Blu Burger at The Summit.  Yes the menu was the same as were the booths and chairs but that was about all.  The Summit was clean with a fabulous stocked bar and excellent service.  My burger topped with mushrooms, onions and gorgonzola cheese was perfect.  The sweet potatoe fries crispy and tasty.  If you are craving for a burger try BLU BURGER GRILLE but at The Summit."
1,"We went here to celebrate getting a new part time job.  We reserved a table pool-side (on the roof).  The atmosphere on the roof (once they opened it) was really nice-and our table was right next to the pool.  \n\nThe appetizers (Shrimp Dominick and Fried Meatballs) were very good.  We ordered steaks.  My wife ordered the filet-medium.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye. \n\nHer filet was very good (not the best we've ever had, but OK)  My ribeye (for just under $50) was the worst ribeye I have ever had.  It was dry (if you can imagine a ribeye being dry). And instead of nice marbling, gristle seemed to rule in may spots.   I've had better ribeyes at home that we bought at Albertsons.\n\nI didn't complain at the restaurant, although they asked often how everything  was.  Maybe I should have--but I didn't want to make a scene, and I didn't want to wait for any kind  of correction. But my experience with the ribeye caused us to say--this is a \""one and done\"" restaurant.  Way too many other good steakhouses to spend this kind of money (total bill was $240 with tip).  \n\nIn fact, the best ribeye I've had in a restaurant lately was at Longhorn Steakhouse--and it was \""only\"" $25.  It beat Dominicks ribeye hands down."
1,I'm only giving it two stars due to the fact that I have so many childhood memories here...So when i decided to stay here again just to remember the good times...MAN WAS I A STUPID KID?! so nasty...do not eat at the buffet here! just go to mcdonalds!!
4,"So delicious!\n\nThe wait staff there is very knowledgeable about the food and the cooking process and you get five star service.  \n\nThis place is a dream for foodies.  Seriously, if you are a foodie and you don't go here while in Vegas you are missing out.\n\nIts fairly expensive but definitely worth the experience.  The food is really a work of art and so delicious."
3,"loved the location of the elara,the only minor complaint is that the self parking is not clearly marked (park on the 3rd floor of the planet hollywood garage and in the sw corner you can access the elara) check in was quick,rooom was just as pictured,liked the black out electic blinds,read some reviews that complained about the long walk to the strip but it's las vegas and all you do is walk and it wasn't really that long and you walking thru the miracle mile shops so it goes by quick.Pool was nice and not overly busy during the week the only drawback is they check your bag for outside beverages so your stuck paying for drinks at the pool...........i will stay here the next time i go back"
3,"Not a mall person by any means, but this mall is nice.  It's well kept and has a nice mix of store selections.\n\nThe food court has a good mix places, including your normal fasties: a Subway and Chick-fil-a and there are some big name restaurant chains like Firebirds or Bravo! if you are looking to spend more $$ on the food experience. \n\nThe mall itself reminds me of an old warehouse, but obviously nicer... the wooden slat ceiling gives me the impression of an old timey railway station with interior brick columns.  I definitely appreciate the architecture of the building and the fact there are ample places to rest your rear end (especially if you aren't quite a \""shop till you drop\"" person)."
1,"Won't go back. \nBuilding was nice, clean. Wait was short. Waiter pushed his suggestions instead of listening to what we wanted. \nFood seemed to be designed more on how exotic the ingredients sounded instead of how they might actually taste together. \""shredded arugula with capers and a mango habenero mojo\"".   Stuff like that."
2,First time in the new digs. Ambiance is noisy and visually stark - next time will sit in  the bar. And wait service can't seem to cover the larger square footage with speed. Preferred the intimacy found in the old digs. But the food remains trustworthy - true to the farm-to-table concept and provided at an affordable price.
2,"Fair play to Oddbins, this is a great location for an off licence specialising in whisky. The selection of our nation's most famous export is interesting, varied and comprehensive. Everything is displayed in an enticing and attractive way and there are little notes next to some bottles to inform you of what delights lie before you. The staff here know their stuff and can advise you without appearing patronising or condescending. And, Oddbins being Oddbins ,there are always a few wee bargains floating around the place if you browse hard enough."
4,"Great food, margaritas are smooth, service is great. Good value. Just the perfect amount of spicy. Will come back next time."
3,"I've only eaten here once so far, but I had a good salad at a fair price, and I didn't need to wait long for it. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with Pittsburgh-themed photos, maps, and objects. I haven't made it back here yet, but I plan to sometime in the future."
3,"Yeah, yeah the decor is tacky and dated.  But you don't come to Touch of Thai for the sexiness of its appeal, you come here for the food.  \n\n$5.95 will get you a complete lunch of Red Curry, soup, wontons and an eggroll.  That's cheaper than Kyoto Bowl!  And yes it's delicious.  The aroma of the red curry is intoxicating, the scent of the coconut milk had my mouth watering before I'd even taken a bite. The flavor is rich and just sweet enough, with the perfect amount of spice for my taste (I ordered mild).  It could have used a few more veggies - there were only 3 green beans in my entire dish. \n\nNot the best Thai food I've ever had, but it was certainly up there.  I would definitely recommend this place for good service, quality food and cheap eats."
4,"Found myself alone for lunch and remembered the sign outside while visiting 'Moe's'.  Asian grill $5.99. Can't be good, right? WRONG!!!  This was EXCELLENT!  They had 4 or 5 choices of lunch choices and the flounder was excellent!  That and a diet coke was less than $9!  And again, did I say EXCELLENT???   Go, give it a lunch try..... You will see for yourself!  Oh, and the staff was almost too attentive, and extremely courteous.  Can't wait to take my office buddies."
3,"Their staff is friendly and inviting. Their food and drinks are just as good, meaning whatever you order you won't be disappointed with. \n\nSome of the must tries are:\n- the cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries. Seriously, they are the best things EVER.\n- the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer. It's filling enough that it could be your meal.\n- the rosemary chicken sandwich. No words can describe this masterpiece.\n- the apricot salmon. I order salmon almost everywhere I go and this is one of my favorites."
1,"We went to the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center to see the Sammy Hagar show last month. The venue is in a great spot downtown that allowed for easy access to restaurants and bars which was great. I was a little skeptical about the sound quality and the comfort (crowd) but the place was actually pretty cool with excellent sound quality. There are also a very ample number of restrooms, which is a big problem at a number of other places. Unfortunately, the bad far outweighs the good with regards to the DLVEC.\n\n  We had tickets at will call and once we got to the window it still took about 20 minutes for the staff to find us on their list. I showed them the confirmation email on my phone, but they continued to search their obviously cumbersome and/or antiquated system of finding tickets. I wrote this off as first event bugs that needed to be worked out and we moved on. \n\n  The space is cavernous and while there are no seats in the GA area that's fine by me because who sits down at a good show, right? I will say that I'm glad we didn't pay for VIP seating. Most of the VIP area was significantly further away for the stage than we were in GA. The VIP tickets were about 2  1/2 times what we paid and that is hardly worth it just to have a chair.\n\n  The drink lines were by far the worst I've ever encountered at an event and that includes lines I've been in at NHL and MLB playoff games in packed stadiums. We were in line for over 1 hour and were basically forced to buy multiple drink as opposed to standing in line again. When we reached to front of the line we saw that there was a single bartender and one bar back at each of the two service areas. Given the price of the drinks they could have had 2 or 3 bartenders on each side and still raked in tens of thousands of dollars. I was nearly force to hit the PBR line which was significantly shorter. \n\n  My hope is that the folks that run the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center take a look at some of these reviews and take heed to the advice given. This venue has the potential to be a great place to see a show with a little fine tuning by the management. I'm hoping to be able to do a follow-up in the future that is more positive."
2,"This place turned an old diner into a Pho joint. \n\nthe food was decent here but nothing great, it is one of the only two in the area so choices in this part of town are limited. Overall I would go back if Siagon 8 was closed but other than that I would rather drive to Spring mountain for my Pho fix."
2,"I was so excited to come here. Always made plans that never materialized. So me and two foodie buds descended upon the much talked about St Francis, ready to be wowed. Well, not quite what happened. We ordered beer...big surprise. I smelled the musty odor of my \""not clean, or maybe dried with a disgusting towel\"" beer glass. We all know the smell. I tried to not breathe in as I drank until one of my comrades was like \""WTH?\"" as he sipped his. We then watched as the bartenders refilled empty juice containers without rinsing them, and wiped more glasses with towels that were getting a lot of use. The bar was also really dirty. \""They need to hire a chick\"", was one suggestion. That might work, depending on the chick. This so detracted from the experience that though the food was stellar, and it so was, I cannot say I enjoyed it as I may have if I wasn't smelling mildew glass the whole time. \""Why didn't you ask them to clean your glass?\"", you ask? Because they were cleaning EVERYTHING with these same gross towels and I was afraid to. Big wins-Mongolian Meatballs and Cheese Flatbread. Skip the bar, sit at a table and drink from the bottle..."
3,"It's a nice little cafe that offers a pretty good variety of food. The service is really good and so are the prices. I have only eaten there once, but the food was delicious."
2,"By the prices they were charging, I would have expected a meal that tasted less like reheated Olive Garden doused in parmesan. \n\nOn the plus side it appeared to be 40-something-divorcee's night at the bar next door... so that was entertaining."
3,"I have been to Tequila Bar twice. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were delicious. The fries were seasoned to perfection. There's a special twist to the flavours. You won't be disappointed. The only critique I have is concerning the portions. You may still have room in your stomach after finishing your meal.Therefore, I recommend you order an appetizer as well. \nPrice/quality ratio = good. Price/quantity= so-so. \nThis should not stop you from trying this gem. It's a must!"
3,"Our initial trip to this highly rated (Zagat) Churrascaria did not begin well when the greeter did not seat us immediately or even after 10 minutes despite the fact that we had a reservation.  Three parties who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. Explanation given was that they wanted to clear a nice table for us....hmmm.  A comped desert from the manager soothed our feelings however. \n\nThese style of Brazilian steakhouses which have sprung up around the country in recent years charge about $40 -$50 for an endless serving of 20 or 30 different types of grilled beef, lamb, chicken and fish. You basically strap on your feed bag and let 'er rip.  Quality of the meat in these establishments is hit or miss and quantity comes before quality here.  Lots of sides are included.  The meal is actually pretty good if you contain yourself and select the different cuts of meat wisely. At Via Brazil, we liked the filet mignon wrapped in bacon, the NY strip, the chicken drumsticks, the beef ribs, the flank steak, and grilled asparagus.  Suggest you avoid the garlic steak and tri tip -- tough and chewy during our visit. Some of the meats were over seasoned -- too salty -- and the cooks need to have slightly gentler hands on their salt shakers. \n\nA salad bar is included and I would say it was average at best and inferior to what we have experienced at Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil, two competitor chains. The selection of cold and hot salads was not as varied and numerous as we have seen elsewhere. The selections they did have were tasty and fresh however. \n\nOur party of three ordered the Sterling meal and the Prime meal plus an ala carte salad and fish entree.  The Sterling meal costs an extra 10 dollars and there are premium meat selections (lamb chops, shrimp, NY strip) that come with it. In my opinion, worth it. \n\nA pretty good meal and pretty good table service and I recommend Via Brazil without reservation.  Decent value for a good meal, not perfect but a nice restaurant nonetheless."
4,Awesome! Always awesome!
1,I want to give them a one star.  Ordered the French dip and pot roast sandwich.... Both lacking in appearance as well as substance.  Service was good and everyone was very friendly.... So I give them two stars.  Mcalisters would be disappointed in this effort!
0,"You can disregard my last review. this place got cocky and went to hell pretty quickly. \n1) service sucked. After waiting 10-15 minutes just to order, the waitress had no apologies. When the food came 5 minutes after that, and was sent back 3 times, she had nothing to say about that. When I went to go pay and the cashire asked about the food I told him it was horrible and he laughed then the waitress next to him said, \""ya we've been having issues with that for a while now.\""\n2) Food was tragic. cold, tastless, and off. \n3) the lounge was very random.  the drinks were weak, service slow, and I never got the money I cashed out! \n\nNot coming back, ever."
4,"Excellent Customer service! Quick, fast, and my eyebrows look amazing :-)"
3,"Swung in on Monday morning and as always timed it perfectly!  Walked in, sat down, had what little hair I have cut and left.  Very quick and painless."
3,"I stayed here for one night while on a recent business trip! I wish I had discovered this place sooner....\n\nI was pleasantly surprised! I never heard of this place and I usually stick to the Holiday Inn brand. A group of fellow co-workers recently started staying at this place as it was discovered to be a part of the IHG group.  \n\nThe staff was really nice and friendly!\n\nI was told to get a room on the higher floor because of the noise. Unfortunately, by the time I checked in, the rooms on the higher floors were already taken. I was on the third floor and I didn't hear any noise!\nMy room was bright and sunny............and very peaceful!  I slept really well! \n\nThe covered parking garage was a big plus...........My car was nice and cool when I got in it! That counts for a lot in the Phoenix heat!"
4,"What more can you say about this place?\n\nI love Bouchon.\n\nThis is food heaven.  This really is as good as it possibly can get.  There is no pretentiousness, just INCREDIBLY delicious foods.  On top of that impeccable service.\n\nBravo Mr. Keller."
1,"March 2014...Stayed at the TI in Vegas for 2 nights. Was in town for a convention, not just for a carefree time.\nThe room was clean and well stocked. \n\nFirst... I went to flip on the light in bathroom and cut my finger on the switch plate. The hard plastic was broken into pieces and the pieces had been fitted back into the switch plate cover. I dislodged them when I cut my finger, proceeded to stop the bleeding, collected all the pieces, wrapped them neatly in a tissue and took them to the front desk in the morning. The manager was unimpressed with my situation and said that someone would go up to look into it. When I arrived back in my room for the evening, my switch plate was still missing pieces.  It was not fixed during my stay.\n\nNext... There is this little, sliding mechanism that opens and closes the window about an inch. This thing would not stay closed,  It was WINDY outside and I love the sound of the wind, but it sounded like a wind tunnel. This was not my only gripe.\n\nFinally... I have stupid food allergies and something on their approved list made me super sick. I only ate at their establishment while in Vegas because I was so afraid of eating anywhere else and getting sick. Oh well...  On a plus side... their staff was so helpful in trying to find me safe foods, I really really appreciate their efforts. The kind lady in the salad area of the buffet was wonderful and very helpful.\n\nI'm really sad to leave a 2 star for them and will return again... not to be critical, but to enjoy the time that I know TI is worthy of providing."

4,"I was originally hesitant on booking The Mirage do to numerous reviews complaining of it being an older resort.  I have been to Vegas about ten or so times and have stayed downtown once and the others on the strip between Ceaser's, Harrah's and The Flamingo.  My wife and I wanted to try somewhere new.  The Cons First : It is a resort which to me didn't seem any different than the other Vegas Hotels other than the $28 fee per night for basically the only differing perk from other hotels was internet  included.  The Pros: We stayed on the 26th floor with a strip view and the floors own personal elevator which was excellent.  You would go right from your floor to the Lobby and back.  This was wonderful when you have to just run up to grab something and didn't have to deal with stopping on every floor.  The pool is by far the best I have seen in Vegas and The Hotel is layed out so you get sun from sun up to sun down with the hotel never blocking and shading the pool which was great.  The staff was great and they heard it was our anniversary so sent chocolates to our room.  We saw Beetles Love by Cique De Sol and it was excellent 10/10 for sure.  Overall :  I felt the King Tower Deluxe for the view and own elevator was great and only for about an extra 30 a night.  I loved everything about the Mirage and would go back in a heart beat, centrally located, easy access to the strip and great staff."
0,"I have always had a mobile detail person come to my home to detail my SUV But he's out of town for the holidays so I thought I would try out fabulous Freddy's on Ft. Apache and Charleston since they always seem to be pretty busy with their car wash. I paid for the vip detail service. 2 hours later, I got to inspect my SUV. My car was still dirty. There is no \""detail\"" to their service. I have a white SUV and there were dirty water spots behind the side view mirrors, dirty water spots inside all of my doors and dirty water spots everywhere all over my car. I'm not a picky person but I was NOT happy with the outside of my car. U asked for the manager and a \""trainer\"" came over and had the guys clean the truck properly and she was kind enough to give me a $20 off of my next detail but I'll never go back for a detail again. Totally not worth it. Also, when I asked for the manager, the guys said \""whatever, he's gonna tell you the same thing\"". HORRIBLE service.  I should have listened to all of their other poor reviews but I didn't know it would be as back as everyone had reviewed.  I would have had the outside cleaned the way they did, as if I had driven through any car wash.  Bad service!!!! Dirty car!!!"
0,"Worst place I've ever ate at in my life! $35 for TWO people & the food was complete shit.\nI had a cheese tortilla(TCT) & my husband had chicken tamales. \nThe TCT was so greasy I could barely eat it & my husbands chicken tamales weren't even cooked. The meat was PINK!!\n\nA car full of ladies were holding us up from getting into our car & when all 6 piled out they asked, \""how was your dinner.\"" I replied, \""it was terrible & I would never recommend this place to anyone!\"" 5 of them started walking away & one lady kept talking & said one of the ladies that walked away was the OWNER! Not even a I'm sorry your dinner was bad what can we do to make it better....\n\nWe came from BOULDER CITY cause I'm 7 months pregnant & was craving Mexican food so we had a date night there.\nAfter reading a lady had a COCKAROACH in her tamale & the chicken wasn't cooked in my husbands, I think this place needs to get reported to the health department so I will gladly be doing so.  just looking at his tamale made me want to THROW UP!"
4,I can't say enough about what Sapphire Bookkeeping has done for our family's tax prep! We were so disorganized and always late until we found Sapphire. In one year Tiffany has totally transformed the way we approach our taxes and even makes the process enjoyable! The ability to work over email with everthing digital makes tax time the easiest it can be. Any individual or family who needs help with their taxes should hire Sapphire.
2,"I really like this cafe. It is now my first choice for a bite when at desert ridge. I have several complaints however on areas I feel need improvement. First of all, WHY are they closed on Sundays??? I'm sure it has something to do with religion, which I respect, but it is a BIG mistake from a business standpoint. Desert ridge gets sooooo much foot traffic on weekends!! Not to mention all the people who want a nice soup and salad after church service. I, myself, have found myself wanting to eat at Zumas on many a Sunday (if not every Sunday since opening) even driving there on two occasions before remembering they are closed. I feel bad for them for all the business they are losing being closed on Sunday. Bad, bad decision. At least open up for lunch.\nSecondly, I was VERY disappointed with the kids portion size. You DO NOT get your money's worth there. My daughter is nine and the amount you get would hardly satisfy a three yr old. The fruit cup was literally four grapes and three mandarin orange pieces! The two chicken strips are tiny, also. Provide some decent size meal options for kids, please. I would gladly pay a little more but as it is now, I could go anywhere else in the ficinity and get twice the amount, at least.\nAnd lastly, I was asked twice what I ordered but other servers, which I found odd. I had to go back to the beginning of the line where the menu is to check since I couldn't remember the name of it. Not just once, but twice!!\n\nOverall, the food has good flavor. I agree with the other reviewer though about the extras being a pitiful attempt to make a buck. Add a few croutons at NO charge!! I mean geez, really?"
0,I had to download the yelp app to my new phone just to explain how horrible this food was. If you pay $7 for a bowl of essentially 'chicken noodle soup' it really should not be a bowl scantily filled with tenden laden crunchy lumps of dark chicken 'meat' and floating pieces of nasty looking chicken skins. There was other random bits oily nasty broth and even though I was told they were going to call my number when ready I had to get tapped by another customer asking me if that was my food sitting on the counter. (hint it was)
0,"If this establishment were located anywhere else it would die the death it so much deserves.  We waited for over an hour to be seated only to be served the worse bar food we have ever encountered, it's hard to screw up chicken wings but mcfaddens did a fine job in doing so. Not only was the food bad but we were offered plastic dinner ware because they ran out of the metal forks and knives.\nThere are to many other choices in the area to try,stay away from this place at all cost you'll be glad you did."
0,Just got back from Brunch there. We had the buffet for $8. It was not very good compared to other indian brunches we have had -- cheap priced and cheap food. Flavor -- blah. \n\nMy suggest avoid or avoid the brunch
0,NEVER ORDER MABO NASU \n.... Taste like nothing -_-#\nThe other special is good but *sigh\nLearned my lesson : be careful when u wanna be ADVENTUROUS\n\nBtw service sucks\nThey can't even let me switch.\nHAVE TO painfully finish tasteless dishes \nWorst noodle I had in my life so far
2,"Hummus trio is awesome.  The servers have been slow in the past, and don't come back often enough to make sure you don't need anything else.  I love the openness of this location.  Their grilled chicken with garlic sauce pita/lavoshes, are so good."
4,Start with the Heirloom tomato appetizer (they split it for the 2 of us for a perfect appetizer) and then try the Monkfish (fish lovers) or the grilled Filet + Braised Beef Short Ribs (beef lovers) and I can tell you that you will not be disappointed. This was the best meal I have enjoyed this year and I would highly recommend it. The service was impeccable as well!
0,"Four stalls in the ladies' room and two had out-of-order signs on them, one had a shower curtain in place of a door, and the one remaining in working order with a door had no t.p. at 8:00 pm."
2,"Ordered the chicken supreme thin crust and it was okay. It didn't really look like thin crust and it was kind of soggy. They do put a lot of topping on it, but I would have rather gotten the thin crust at dominos."
0,"i really did not enjoy my short time in this awful restaurant. \nThe only reason i came here is because a friend of mine keeps kosher and we couldnt really find anywhere else to eat, so we came here. \nThe service was crap. The waiter acted like a freaking diva, and the food was terrible. \nWe were a party of 5 people, so we pushed 2 tables together. The retard waiter came up to our group and said we cant push tables together, so 5 people were stuffed on a table that was meant for 2 people ( un-freaking-believable).\nThere were no prices on the menu nor on the large overhead lighted up menu next to the register, so we ordered an XL pizza assuming it would be $13-17ish. We then helped ourselves to some snapples which we later found out were $3.50...!!! wtf! who charges $3.50 for a little bottles of snapple?!\nAfter we finish eating our nasty pizza ( even microwave pizza is better then their pizza) on our tiny table with a party of 5 we ask for the bill.\nThe waiter comes to our table, throws the bill on the table as if hes doing us a favor and walks away...\nThe bill came out to $45!!!! FOR ONE XL PIZZA?!!!!!! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! IM NOT AT SOME FANCY RESTAURANT!\nThis restaurant is seriously this little ugly 550 square foot room with a tiny kitchen in an ugly area off the strip. Who on earth do you think you are charging us $45 for a pizza. Freaking retards.\n\nWe left $1 for tip. I even considered that too much.\n\nYou give us jews a bad name, shame on you idiots."
2,"The girl working the register was too busy talking to her coworkers to get my order right or to remember to give me the soft drink I ordered, but the  Birria burrito I got instead of the breakfast burrito I ordered was awesome. Great food, poor service."
2,"Have been coming here for years, and always received good service and very good food.  \nWent there yesterday, and got absolutely great repeat service from Jonathan (always a hoot).\nWife and I both tried new dishes and thoroughly enjoyed them.\nThe BIG downside was we could no longer enjoy a \""cozy\"" seating because all the top partitions were removed!\nSo now, all patrons can see all other patrons across the entire restaurant.....\n\nBut the worst part is now the noise from the entire restaurant hits every table.  There were times I could not hear what my wife was saying, with her sitting across from me.\n\nWhat should have been a quiet, relaxing meal on a Saturday afternoon was a constant 'what - say again?'\n\nNot sure of the reason to chop off the tops of all booths, but it was not a good decision.\n\nWe will probably go elsewhere next time, coupons or not"
2,"This is probably the definition of a hole-in-the-wall mom-and-pop restaurant. The walls are plastered in crayon pictures addressed to the lady owner, and the dining area is lightly decorated and filled with soft and appropriate music. I love it for its quaintness and neatness, I love it for its owners, several dishes are excellent, but the portion sizes tend to run small for the price and often times the dishes are bland.\n\nI think every time we have come here it has been very, very dead. There is usually one, maybe two other parties dining in, and sometimes a customers or two comes in to pick up a take-out order. That probably explains the portion sizes. However, if you come here for a quiet atmosphere and pretty authentic Thai food, then it's just the place.\n\nThe mini Thai egg rolls are probably one of the better appetizers, as are the soups; very flavorful and full of herbs. The curries here are amazing and definitely my favorite (mussaman is the way to go). Some of the noodle dishes do stand out as well. You need to specify if you want something more spicy or more mild as they do not ask. Main dishes are very light, meaning they are not drenched in sauce which is refreshing compared to some heavier Thai cuisines in the area. I would however recommend asking for extra sauce or a little extra spice to bring the plate to life.\n\nThey try to keep the ingredient combinations as authentic as possible, so if you ask for any substitutions they are happy to oblige but you may receive a weird look in return. No salt, pepper, or soy sauce at the table, but if you ask they will bring out whatever you need. The husband is not as talkative as the wife, but they are both very kind, very hard workers, and are constantly running back and forth to the kitchen.\n\nI come here for the quiet dining experience rather than exceptional Thai food. It is close and convenient, but if you want more variety or are wanting to experience Thai food for the first time, I'd recommend sampling some other places first as you may not be blown away here."
3,"Cool atmosphere, awesome mix of people and its super close for me."
0,"If I could give this place no stars, I would. I used to enjoy Flattop, a couple of years ago Flattop really wasn't bad at all! You filled a bowl with vegetables, beans, rice, and sauce. You'd fill a smaller bowl with your choice of meats, then leave them on the side for them to be stir fried into really delicious meal. \nThat is not the case anymore, now you get back a  bowl of really BLAND, overcooked stuff. It doesn't even taste like stir fry, just like a bunch of dried up random bits of food. I had convinced my friend to go here instead of Chipotle and then felt really embarrassed when he had to get up to get extra sauce from the station because his food was that dry. The meal was so bad and took so long, the least I could do was pay for both our meals. Never again will I be coming back here."
1,"I could see through the coffee. They should really not serve it in glass mugs.  \n\nBloody Mary was good, not outstanding. Breakfast was good (I had the Monte Carlo), but not outstanding. For a place that bills itself as healthy and fresh, I expected more inventive options."
3,"I ate at Outbacks around the US on my trip and this Outback because of the service was the #1 best. We ate in the bar and Melissa was our server. She was awesome \nFood is always consistent ... I do wish Outback would put one decent  draft beer in as they use to instead of the second rate Blue Moons, Samuel Adams Dos Equis choices. Yuk \nThey use to have some type of Aussie Amber that was great. I hate the beer choices I love their food. Thank you for great attention to my last visit."
3,"Fast, affordable, and pleasant.\n\nThey took a look at my car, determined the correct tire to replace mine, and we were in and out w/in 10 mins. We prepaid so that when they called to tell me it was finished I could just get my keys and be on my way.\n\nSo. Easy."
0,"I really really wanted to love this place.  It comes highly recommended by so many people here on yelp plus it is located in a great spot.   I liked Dr Ryan right away on our first visit.  I was hesitant about her because she is so young but she won me over by the end of our visit.  I decided the 30 minute wait must have been just an emergency issue and chalked it off.  \n\nToday was my second visit when I brought our other dog in for his shots.\nI had requested Dr Ryan because she had been so good the first time.  When I had to change our appointment a week out I decided to wait a few days longer just so we could get her.  Well, again I was tapping my toes in the exam room.  This time for almost an hour.  I finally told them I had to leave and the staff offered me Dr Dutton who came in right away and gave  the shots.  \n\nMost places, would give you a break on the visit fee or write it off after making you wait almost an hour.  Not them.  Full price.  The fact that people work hard to get to their appointments on time seems to escape some establishments.  Blue Cross is apparently one of them.  Only one person stuck their head in to say she was running late.  Other than that I could have been running a prostitution ring out of that room and no one would have noticed.\n\nSorry Blue Cross...burn me once shame on you...burn me twice and shame on me.  I won't be returning.  You have nice vets but there are lots of good vets in the valley that will actually value my time and business."
1,"Let me start by saying they have great bread, and the salad was good. I had the Shrimp Scampi, and it had very little flavor. The sauce on the side of pasta tasted like a store bought jar. My husband had the Eggplant Dore, and I honestly didn't know you could slice eggplant that thin. \n\nI have to say that the minestrone soup was awful. It was basically cabbage in a broth, celery, and two kidney beans. I know different places cook it differently, but I expected there at least to be beans or pasta in it. \n\nOn a good note, the server was very friendly and the wait for the food was minimal. The prices were reasonable and they seemed to have a lot of customers but  I can't say we will go back."
3,We dined here with some friends!! It was great I had the rice! My boyfriend could not get enough of the sticky rice? I enjoyed the drinks a well all of the desserts are delish.
2,"I have eaten here several times, and the food has always been excellent!  Tonight we had the wonton soup and spring rolls, followed by a chicken and green bean dinner.  Everything was great except the chicken and green beans, which was a bit too salty.  It seemed that some new staff was being trained, and there were a few minor goofs, including a water spill across the table, but the poor waitress couldn't apologize enough and cleaned everything up.\n\nOverall, a good experience, but not as good as past visits."
4,"We had a great experience here tonight. I ordered a coffee and surprisingly they have a nice flavored coffee, was fresh. Went at night too, I thought it would be an old pot, but she said they make it fresh each time.\n\nOrdered pizza which was great and an appetizer. It was really busy tonight but the service was still excellent. \n\nLast, we had the warm cookie and ice cream for desert. So amazing, you have to order this for sure. Perfect!! I liked it with my coffee, good combo."
2,"Caprese salad and bruchetta with spicy salami spread were excellent.  Main course and desert were average, so was the service.  Pretty good, but you can probably do better in Charlotte."
4,"Thanks Yelp for reminding me to write this review.  All I can say is OMG.  This was THE best food experience of my life. Since it was our anniversary we decided to throw caution to the wind and go with the chef's choice menu.  We told our amazing waitress that if the cost went up a bit so that the chef could deviate and give us some adventurous options, we would be up for that.  \n\nOnce we made that selection, the food NEVER stopped coming and each dish was better than the next!  Some stand out favorites were:  The tempura lobster tail medallions served beautifully in the lobster tail.  The Sushi bowl that came was amazingly beautiful and some of the best I've ever had.  \n\nThe vegetable dishes were wonderful, brussel sprouts, some sort of chile we've never had but now crave. \n\nThe beer they import directly from Japan was fantastic!  \n\nI really, really can't say enough about this meal and the service.  We sat outside but if you do the chefs meal, we would recommend sitting at the table that wraps around the kitchen."
3,"We went there for dinner last night with a friend visiting. It was a very delicious meal. Highly recommend. \n\nOur friend ordered a rib eye with a steak sauce,  mashed potato side with a poached egg on top; My husband and I shared a new York steak, dry aged beef tortellini and short rib ravioli. Our friend enjoyed the rib eye a lot. We also like the new York steak very much. We like that it is very tasty, soft, flavorful, and the beef is hormone free and antibiotic free!!! Awesome! The ravioli tasted very great as well. The pasta wasade in house. We were told that the bucatini and spaghetti were dry pasta, others are made in house, that's why we went for ravioli and tortellini. The tortellini tasted great as well but it was very small like an appetizer. \n\nAt the end, we ended our meal with dessert. We had tiramisu and the gelato (strawberry, pistachio and chocolate). Again they were awesome. I like the tiramisu tasting very fresh and the ingredients were of good quality. It is way better than regular ones from american restaurants. The gelato were made in house as well (they said all desserts are made in house daily and fresh). The gelato is priced $12 and it is comprised of 3 scoops with your selected flavor. We like that the gelato is soft, smooth and tasted clean with real ingredients, no artificial flavor, coloring or thickening agent. It is really awesome.\n\nThe food is really pricey, it is okay for once in a while, and the food tasted really good. It was a great experience!"
2,"I am doing three stars, as I found that there are real differences in the rooms here.  \n\nIf you do the \""cheapest\"" rooms, you get a bare minimum room (like Motel 6).  On another trip, I had to upgrade to get in and it was a nice suite like room (kept thinking I was in the wrong place).  \n\nThis is off the end of the strip, and the low price brings in a different level of customer.  \n\nWhen in Vegas on business, and going to be more in downtown this location is for me."
3,"The View Wine Bar and Kitchen \n- A very classy bar with a view of the beautiful fountain, comfortable ambience. Offers good selection of wines, beers and small plates. The service is excellent, price reasonable. There's live entertainment at times.  No happy hour at the main bar.\n- Happy Hour (5-7) is offered in its cute, little Cheese Shoppe & Bar (no view) across the corridor less than 20ft away, with half-off drinks.\n\nYelpy Details: \n\nOne sunny afternoon, I was walking around Tivoli and spotted the Market Place, which attracted my attention, I stepped in out of curiosity.  Inside the front door was a gorgeous staircase leading upstairs. Even though the Market looked unfinished, the sign says there are shops and eatery upstairs. Well, with curiosity and THIRST, I went upstairs. I was pleasantly surprised to see some cute boutique shops open already, especially delighted to see the View Wine Bar and Kitchen open around the corner with a friendly hostess greeting custmers! She told me that they had two sections kitty-corner to each other; one main bar with a view, one charming little cheese shoppe and bar right across the corridor. Happy Hour, 5-7, is available ONLY in the small bar. \n\nI was too thirsty to wait till 5; the view at the main bar and the pleasant live performance of 2 youngsters were too inviting to pass up, so I took a comfortable seat at the classy bar counter with a direct window view of the plaza fountain, happy hour or not! My friendly and helpful young lady bartender promptly settled me down with a draft Stella ($7), and and the free cheese/vegie appetizer; she went on to introduce me to its menu if small plates and very extensive list of wines!  At the bar there were already 5 other customers; 2 tables nearby were also occupied, all happily applauding the band from time to time.\n\nFor the afternoon, I wound up having a delicious BLT Flatbread ($10), 2 Stella ($7 each), and a glass of house cab (Cypress, $6). I made a check-in on Yelp to this establishment, while I was sitting at the bar, and was pleasantly rewarded with a 15%discount!\n\nThe band performed in the elegant front corner, where there was a piano. The young singer looked 13 but had a very nice, rich voice of 30; his partner accompanied him with good guitar playing, not bad! That band kept me glued to the bar for an extra 40+min!\n\nThe main bar did not offer HH, \nthe drinks and small plates are $5-19. Of course, being a wine bar, they offered a large selection of wines from $6-25 a glass. The lady barkeep, Joey, let me sample 2 kinds of Wasatch drafts ($9) and Earthquake Cab ($25/gl). The Wasatch was OK; the Earthquake was outstanding with its mellow, rich, lingering flavor and smooth texture. Joey is very friendly and attentive! All other staff is also quite pleasant and helpful, making one feel welcome! \n[- See pics of menu]\n\nHAPPY HOUR\n- Its \""Cheese Shoppe\"" is a very cute, cozy bar, which offers food and drinks, and cheese, of course! HH is 5-7pm, with half off drinks. That bar has NO view, however, other than the main bar. One can hear and see the live entertainment here, also. When I left the main bar around 5:30, the small bar was almost full.\n\nThe Market Place is handicapped friendly, it has an elevator hidden in a corner beyond the grand stairwell.\n\nNote to Management: There should be a TV facing the bar counter, so customers do not have to turn their necks!\n\nBTW, I was told that the bars and the entire Market building are owned by Chef John Church, who worked with Ramsey and survived!\n\nPeterskis3, Dec 2012"
1,"Seriously, you're a bar inside a hotel and you serve a transient clientele.  Transient as in \""people who are in Vegas to party.\""  LOSE THE ATTITUDE!\n\nUgh.  This is one of *those* places... you know, the kind of place that just might be cool if you're 20 and score a good fake i.d.  But, if you're over 25, run!\n\nThe doormen had oodles of attitude.  I'm pretty sure the head door guy was a person I recently saw on an episode of Intervention.  That made it all the more perfect!\n\nI showed up around Midnight with my friend.  We decided not to go in after we learned the cover is $20 for women.  Seriously?  WTF?  SO NOT WORTH!!!  A dozen of my guy friends REALLY wanted to go in, and their cost was $30 a head... they got us in free, which was one of few redeaming qualities.\n\nThe club is small and full of smoke.   Sure, I'm spoiled by our California laws, but my God, three days later and I still smell of stale cigarettes.  The dance floor was tiny and crowded.  There was some good energy in the crowd, but... well, whatever!\n\nWe had two rounds of shots at the first bar - the bartender suggested jolly ranchers after I asked for something strong.  They were good and he gets a star just for him.  EXPENSIVE, but good.  $13 a shot!\n\nThen we went to the other room, where the bartender was a complete ass.  Seriously.  He ignored our crowd, then came over and asked as what we wanted.  When we told him, he said \""I can't make that at this bar\"" and WALKED AWAY!  He didn't even ask if he could make us something else.  Dude, you work in a bar in a hotel.  I'm all for employment, but you're so NOT all that!\n\nThe music was decent - dance music with the occasional hip hop anthem (yay for Luniz \""I Got 5 On It\"").\n\nIt was an awesome night out, but Tabu had little to do with that.  I'm being generous with the two stars."
4,"All I can say is FREE!  It is really convenient to be able to take this tram, especially with little kids. The whether in Vegas is either hot or cold/ windy, so it is nice to escape the outdoors when walking from one hotel to the next. It is a very clean tram. There are two trams one that goes directly from Excalibur to Mandalay bay/Four seasons or one that stops in between at the Luxor.  Love it!!"
4,Lamb Tandoori burger!  That's all you need to know!
3,There's always one thing that gets me back there all the time. The smoke meat! And I like mine on their smoke meat poutine.
0,"Well I have been to this place several times in the past.  The past is where my visits will stay.   Visited one last time, got sick and the portion size has gone from too much food to a 3 forkful amount of sides.  Too bad for Changing Hands Book Store- hope their business keeps up in spite of the bad food being served next door."
2,"Every restaurant that we remember offers at least one experience that stays with you. For Gandhi, it was our first visit there in December 2005, after a long journey to Montreal. It was late, we were tired and hungry, and worse, indecisive about dinner. But we were rewarded for our choice of Gandhi by wonderful Indian food and, I swear, the best naan I've ever had.\n\nExperiences like that are the bane of diners - we go back trying to repeat them... in my case, trying to have that transcendent naan. I'm not sure it's happened, but in several visits since, we've been nothing but pleased by the delicious Indian food, and the capable, if aloof, service.\n\nYou can accuse restaurants in Old Montreal of offering only bottom-dollar tourist crap, and that charge sticks to a number of establishments. This isn't one of them. I saw one review from a few years ago that described the cuisine as \""British-Indian.\"" It's appropriate for a menu that offers the range of dishes one expects from an Indian restaurant in North America - vindaloos, curries, biranyi, tandoori, bhajis, naan. I don't know true Indian food well enough to quibble about authenticity, but I can say that the flavors, to my palate, are calibrated and nicely balanced - and this seems to be part of the heart and soul of this precise cuisine.\n\nOver a few visits, we came to believe that a request for spicy food would never result in a level of spiciness that we enjoy. But our last two visits in December 2007 convinced us that the kitchen can deliver the spice when called upon.\n\nDesserts here taste pedestrian to me, but after eating as much as I do at Indian restaurants, it could be that I'm all tapped out, so if you've had good desserts here, say so and give some recommendations.\n\nGandhi expanded its space in 2007, approximately doubling the size of the restaurant. One feels less crowded in the dining room now; I've eaten there only once when the restaurant wasn't full or nearly so.\n\nGandhi is worth a visit."
2,Went here around 10 pm on a week night and it was not busy. Took about 15 mins to get a table and even longer to order. Service was slow but food was good. Prices are a little high but it's ARIA so that was expected. A good place to just sit and relax while you wait for your food but not a good place if you have plans and have to be somewhere.
3,"Writing a review of a place that is still in the process of \""becoming\"" is a tricky venture, but given the vendors already in place and the dedication to local sourcing and home-grown business that is evident, I'm already a fan and can only say the future is looking very bright.\n\nFirst thing to know, this former grocery store has been converted into a large indoor pavillion with a number of independent vendors having dedicated space within.  It's like a year-round farmer's market with and handful of local small businesses thrown in.  The biggest being the Farm Stand and the Meat and Fish Co.  The Farm Stand is really a conglomeration of many farmers and purveyors of local produce who get a little bit of shelf space and utilize a central selling point.  A look here is awesome- from micro greens to local cheeses and gormet ravioli.  Seasonal produce is available, as well.  All is local.\n\nThe Not Just Coffee Shop is at the bar and serves some amazing pour over coffee and espresso beverages- they are really making art here and should be a first stop before perusing the other vendors.  I am also a fan of The Dough Bowl, a local bakery that originates from a farm in Morganton.  Whether you just want a fresh-baked croissant or a hearty loaf of bread made from locally milled flours, they are serious artisan bakers.  \n\nNelly Naturals and the Bond Street Wine Co. also have small outposts in the middle of the market, with gourmet snacks and fine wines available for purchase.  Saturdays tend to be the big day here, but this place is a hidden gen in the middle of the week.  Given that they occupy the bottom of the 7th Street Parking Deck and validate your parking for the first hour and a half, there's really nothing to lose by shopping here, and everything to gain by helping local businesses and farmers.\n\nEven more exciting are the businesses on their way here.  Pure Pizza will open soon with a farm to table pizza concept that sounds out of this world.  Given one of the chefs backing the effort, I am sure there are great things to come from this.\n\nTasty Yo frozen yogurt is also planning to set up shop here, and they were one of the first to bring the tart yogurt trend to the local scene.  No doubt they will be popular in the summer.\n\nFran's Filling Station, a well-loved spot down in Dilworth, also has signage indicating they are coming soon.  Not sure what the final concept will be here, but given their large following at their current location, I can imagine there will be plenty coming from this kitchen as well.\n\nSo a central place to eat and shop, knowing your purchases are locally sourced and will keep your dollars in the local economy, what's not to love here?  Given the vendor line up and those on the way, the future does indeed look very bright for the public market.  This is local, done best."
2,Better than I had expected.  Pleasant staff and delicious food at reasonable prices.
1,"Unless you like your crepes really plain - don't bother with this place. The price is just not worth it. $9 for a mixed berry crepe with three SMALL pieces of berries. There were a few crepes laid out for examples, and I thought the fruit on some of them were just for decoration because there was just so little. Hahaha, no. \n\nIf you want gelato, I reccommend that little gelato stand in the Canals instead. I've stayed at the Venetian and Palazzo around 5 times combined in the past year and I ALWAYS get the mango sorbet from that stand. It's so light and fluffy, and so sweet, and omg I WANT IT NOW."
4,"My new favorite lounge in Vegas. Wonderful and tasty unique cocktails. Amazing atmosphere because the lounge is inside a gigantic chandelier. It has three levels and as a nonsmoker it was really nice to be able to sit on the second floor which is nonsmoking. Great for people watching. It was really busy on a Saturday night but once the waitress noticed that we hadn't been served, she was very attentive and even took our picture for us."
2,"OK..... They remodeled the place so I felt like I should do an update since my first review was critical about how dated the place was. HOWEVER, they didn't touch the restrooms. GENIUS!!!! Did you save $7.00 by skipping those nasty ol' things??? Service is still hit and miss as is the food quality but at least the place looks and smells better EXCEPT the bathrooms, of course.  :^/"
1,"This is another place that makes me wish that we could award half stars... I would give this place 2-1/2 stars, it is just not quite good enough to be in the 3 star range.\n\nNot a bad place to go have a beer and a burger... The atmosphere is that of a typical chain restaurant. There are tons of TV's lining the walls. The food is not bad, not great, but not bad. Nothing on the menu is great; the rueben is decent, and the burgers are ok; I would stay away from the fish and chips. They have about 6-7 taps of which a couple are craft, a couple are pseudo craft, and the rest are BMC. The servers were attentive and helpful, and the manager was making rounds, stopping by each table to ensure that everyone was happy with their meals.\n\nOverall, this is a decent place to stop and have a beer and a burger if you are in the area. If you are just looking for a beer and you are in Baxter Village, I would recommend Grapevine, as you will find a better selection of craft beer on tap."
1,"We were staying at the cosmopolitan and searched for a sushi place nearby, this place caught my eye because of the reviews, once we got there our waiter seemed to be in a bad mood, every small request seemed like such a burden, their menu changes for dinner and would not go again just because of their service, the bus boy was nicer than the waiter."
1,"Panera is Panera, and the folks who work here are nice, but weekday parking is AWFUL at this location.  I actually drove away without getting anything this morning because there was no where to park that wouldn't get me towed.  The workers at the office building on the other side of the lot really need to be required to use the parking deck."
1,"Decided I'd join LA Fitness after looking at a couple other fitness centers that my employer offers discounts. I spoke with a salesperson named Cam. I wanted to know the best rate they offer, and if they are offer any employee discounts through my company. I work for a large corporation in AZ. Cam told me that they are offering our company employees a $110 start up and $39.99 monthly rate. I explained to him that LA Fitness is offering a cheaper deal currently on the the main website. He asked me to come in and he would see what he could do. \n\nI went ahead and joined a competing fitness center down the road that I can workout 24 hours per day, and the owners were very engaged. I made sure to tell them to call LA Fitness and thank Cam for the referral."
2,"Been sitting here for almost an hour, no food yet...and no coffee pot. Everyone around us has one....people who got here AFTER us...and after we ordered are almost done eating.\n\nOk, literally 1 minute after posting this the manager came over and apologized for it being so long. The kitchen lost our ticket, so our food wasn't made yet. We also got our coffee pot. Once the food came out it was piping hot and delicious. She also took 50% off the check."
1,"This place was my favorite BBQ in the past. However, now all menu items are smaller, the prices are higher and the sauce is lower quality. I believe smokey Jon can make an award winning sauce but he's not bringing it here. The sides are always top notch the meat is alright but made to be drenched in BBQ, kind of plain alone. All around too expensive for the portion size and used to be a lot higher quality."
0,"Can I give negative stars? \nMy boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said \""here's your check please pay and leave.\"" I said \""Excuse me\"" and he responded \""You are a waste of space at my bar.\"" I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded \""are you serious?\"" All he said was \""Leave\"" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, \""Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway.\"" As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said \""I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!\"" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out? Very questionable service to me."
0,"Nothing Joyful about it. Worst I've had in years. The restaurant is in a failing strip mall. No windows, dark and dingy and it smelled of Pine sol.  Staff did not greet us with a smile ( I can't blame them, maybe too depressed). We went at lunchtime and the place was empty - save for one table.  I ordered the Kung Pao as a safe bet. The chicken was hard and rubbery, the sauce was salty - tasted mostly like soy sauce. I thought maybe it was just me, so I took the rest home for my husband. He said it was \""inedible\"". Then I told him where I went and he said \""I could have told you that, that place is awful\"". \nMy friend ordered the Shrimp in Lobster sauce, she said it was ok, but she would never go back. The egg rolls were soggy and greasy and the fried rice was non nondescript. I have no idea why anyone would give this place 5 stars! I know it's been around a while - maybe they are regulars."
3,"Best brunch I have had in a very long time. The service is beyond excellent. I couldn't finish a glass of water or mimosa if i tried. The servers worked as a great team and made sure our table was always cleaned when we went for more food and our glasses filled. \n\nThe seafood buffet options (king crab and shrimp) were tasty as were all of the meat options (lamb, roast beef, bacon covered port roast). \n\nThe only knock I would have against the food was the deserts, which mainly were little layer cakes. They tasted stale and prepared long before they were served. \n\nHowever, you will impress everyone you bring with the amazing views of the city."
0,"Family business or not; thieves are thieves.\n\nThey re-plumbed my kitchen sink, then made off with my additional s-traps and plumbing tape. Then they bill me for the parts!!! WTF!!\n\nI called \""Dave the plumber\"" and asked him to return my parts. He said that he would. NEVER DID. Lame.\n\nStay far away from Jack Dish."
4,"I'm a big fan of Planet Hollywood.  The ambiance is pretty nice and the staff is friendly.\n\nYOLOS is conveniently located adjacent to the entrance and the casino floor.  I ordered three bottled Miller Lites, which were delicious as always.  The bartender was an attentive hottie wearing a black tank top and yoga pants.  So I've got no complaints there.\n\nMy friends and I, who were killing time before the BRITNEY show chatted with a couple of young ladies at the bar who were also seeing BRITNEY that night.\n\nAll in all - this is a nice place with good energy :-)"
1,"Le iBurger est un endroit \u00e0 essayer une fois (par pure curiosit\u00e9!). Le concept est int\u00e9ressant: des tables \u00e0 \u00e9crans tactiles qui nous permettent de commander nos repas et nos breuvages. \n\nLes choix de burgers sont int\u00e9ressants \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, mais pour le prix, on s'attend \u00e0 un peu mieux. Bien, mais pas exceptionnel. Le service \u00e9galement \u00e9tait correct, sans plus. \n\nL'exp\u00e9rience est assez unique, mais je ne suis pas convaincue que j'y retournerais, \u00e0 moins de vouloir faire plaisir \u00e0 un/e ami/e qui tiendrait vraiment \u00e0 y aller pour un anniversaire, par exemple."
0,"My group went to Nobhill Tavern for the late night happy hour, expecting to have one of the best meals of our Vegas trip.  We were nothing but disappointed. \n\nService:  We had one of those servers who think nothing is more impressive than not writing down our orders.  I told him three times I wanted the little wedge salad with NO BACON.  When the salad came, it had bacon.  Of course.  Everything else we ordered arrived, and he came to check on us after we had finished.  We told him we never got our flatbread.  Obviously, he forgot to put it in, but instead of fessing up he told us it takes a long time because they make each one fresh.  So...does that mean everything else we got was just sitting around?  When the flatbread came a few minutes later, it wasn't even warm.  There was nothing about it that would have taken any longer than the rest of our order.\n\nFood:  We ordered the beer battered shrimp, two lobster rolls, the little gem wedge salad, flatbread, and house made chips and dip.  The chips and dip came first, and were the best I've ever had - ah, we had such high hopes for Nobhill!  However, the shrimp were nothing special, and $8 for four pieces of shrimp is nuts if there is nothing special about them.  The lobster rolls had a weird fake-lemon taste, in a bad way.  The wedge salad came with four halves of grape tomatoes (so only two tomatoes total), three small pieces of bacon (that I didn't want), and three chunks of iceberg lettuce with a flavorless blue cheese dressing.  The flatbread was basically a cracker with a spinach/tomato topping.  It was all mediocre, the lobster rolls were actually on the bad side.  Everything was $8 for the late night menu, but the chips and dip were $5.\n\nOverall, my expectations were not met, and I will not be back."
2,"So, you want to go to Vegas.\n\nAnd you don't want to shell out for Bellagio or MGM.\n\nAnd you don't want to stay at the no-tell motel where you have to wonder - is that stain on the sheet spaghetti sauce? blood? other bodily waste?\n\nYou get the picture. \n\nWell, then Excalibur is the place for you. The Vegas version of a medieval castle, they captured the \""dark that no sunlight can penetrate\"" quality that is no doubt quite authentic. However, it is also quite centrally located. I had a conference at MGM and Excalibur was literally across the street, which made my life easy. I'm a walker, so I traveled up and down the Strip on foot, but if you don't want to trek so extensively,  you can easily catch the Monorail at MGM. Also, Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay are all connected by shuttle and escalators so you can wander among three casino/hotels for the price of one! \n\nThe rooms are budget but the cost is budget, too. The beds are clean and reasonably comfortable. There is no desk but the table with chairs is suitable for work. The bathroom is large enough, with a roomy shower stall. (No bathtub, so if that's really important to you, there you go. You'll have to shower.) Personally, my biggest gripe was no WiFi (really?) and being constrained by wired Internet. I felt like I'd been transported back to 2005. Otherwise, my room left me with no complaints. \n\nThere are some okay restaurants and shows (the joust is fun and they have the Thunder from Down Under if you're looking to check out a different kind of sword fight) but even if you're not into what Excalibur has to offer, the location makes up for it. Seriously, just go to any one of the myriad of entertainment options within a very short walking distance. \n\nOverall, Excalibur is what you probably expect it to be. It's not luxurious. People crazy enough to bring children to Vegas often stay there. It's a little old and tired and depressing (especially in the casino section) but it is what you're probably looking for if you're scouring reviews about this establishment: a convenient, relatively clean and safe place to crash on the Vegas Strip."
1,"A lot of potential, but certainly not there yet!\n\nWe stayed 1/7-1/9/2011 and had so many problems with our room and staff! They are all little things, but when you add them all together in two short days, it makes me want to not come back.\n\n1. Checked in fine (though a room wasn't ready yet because we checked in around 1pm and we wanted a higher floor), given key cards and told that they'd call when room was ready and the cards would auto activate for the new room. 2 hours later, we get a call - ok, just as they told us - but when we pile our luggage in the elevator, the cards weren't activated we couldn't go anywhere. So I had to check back in and they needed to reissue the cards!\n\n2. We get to our room and trash is in the trash cans! Housekeeping didn't clean the room in it's entirety and on top of that, the food on the minibar tray has moldy food on it for sale, and the minibar fridge wouldn't open! I called housekeeping, not one person picked up the phone in 15 minutes! Not even exaggerating! So then I call front desk and she says someone will be up to empty trash, replace the food, and unlock the fridge within 30 minutes. We leave and come back a hour and half later -- trash and moldy food is still there and fridge is still locked! I place another call and was told again another 30 minutes. Someone does come up to unlock the fridge but then tells me he can't because I paid with cash for the room, but I now need to call front desk (again) to have it unlocked by their computer! Though, they already charged a deposit for half the stay on my credit card and used that same credit card when I checked in! After another hour or so, no housekeeping still. I place another call -- the guy who answers tells me there are no notes in the system about me calling before! This point I am a bit frustrated. We go to dinner, come back (4 calls and 5 hours later), the trash is finally emptied -- but the moldy food is still there! And the fridge is still locked!\n\n3. I gave up on the fridge, since I wasn't going to get anything -- but it would have been a nice option to have. The next morning, I have to leave a note for housekeeping to replace the food -- again, because it would have been nice to have options or a snack. After brunch and half the day, we come back...the food has been removed (but not replaced!) and the room was cleaned but the extra blanket and pillow that was on the couch (a friend slept on the couch) was untouched, not even the pillows fluffed or the blanket refolded. And the water from melted ice was left in the ice bucket.\n\n4. The shower only got midly hot (more like very warm), but never in the hot range. And there was a clump of hair over the drain! This was before anyone actually used the shower. And no extra rolls of toilet paper.\n\n5. We played downstairs at the slots...have to say, the slots were pretty loose which was nice, but one slot machine we used broke down while playing -- it took 20 minutes for someone to come over to fix it. We asked several employees to get someone over and not one of them knew what to do or who to contact (and 2 of them worked for the Identity program, the casino rewards program).\n\n6. When we checked out Sunday, there were charges on the bill for mini-bar usage -- over $100 worth of charges! But remember, the mini-bar was locked the entire stay!!!! We waited over 30 minutes for the front desk staff to remove those charges, but he still couldn't figure out how to complete the bill total because the \""system has some problems that they are still working on\"". He finally got those charges off and agreed to comp our room service we had used on one of the nights, but again didn't know how to do it. Back home now and I look at my account statement and there are 4 charges from the hotel, none of them correspond to a charge for room or room service or even the minibar expenses -- but they total over $109 more than what I should have paid. So now I'm waiting for those to fall off, and if they don't they'll hear from me again. We also overheard a manager talk to a housekeeper in front of our room when we were leaving to reclean a room because the guy whose room it was checked in, entered the room and it was still dirty.\n\nAll in all, the hotel is nice, the rooms are great (bed and pillows are too flat though, not comfortable for me), has a balcony that is nice, but the customer service and staff are so disorganized and most of them lack the training or unable to give 5-star service. It's quite unfortunate. The hotel has potential, but I don't think it should have been opened yet until they were able to get all the kinks out of their computer system, housekeeping (I have had cleaner rooms in Stratosphere and Tropicana!), training, communication, etc. \n\nUnless they can provide me with an incentive, an apology that I cannot refuse, and assurance that they have made the necessary changes to staff and training, I think I will be sticking to the Wynn and Encore for stays to Vegas."
1,"Momma no mas! \nSecond visit and I don't know what happened or maybe I'm just better fed in the Diamond Bar and LA's K-Town area but this went to the bottom of my list of KAYCE BBQ.  The bugolgi was pre-marinated and not yummy. The boneless short ribs were super chewy and the octopus was baby whole and not tasty. However, the sides are normal and pretty good, especially with choice of claypot dish. FYI Beware, if anyone has shellfish allergies, the kimchi is made with raw oysters. I'm good on that so I liked it. Service was also pretty good with everything attended and refilled. The lack of stars is on just the meat that was subpar. Service, cleanliness, side dishes are thumbs up, which makes up the only 2 stars."
0,"$8.25 for a little Bloody Mary, well Vodka. You make the call"
2,"This place was ok.  They have a good selection of dogs.\n\nMy wife really likes it, as well as a couple of family members.\n\nI on the other hand am not too big of a fan of charred hotdogs.\n\nEither way, the food there is ok.  The lines are a bit too long for me."
1,We were there for a conference in April 14. Our room was filthy. Trash behind furniture was from St. Patrick's Day. Rug was in need of replacement. Wouldn't stay there again.
1,"I'm shocked by the reviews. All of the good reviews are what led us to this place. Was so excited to try it out. Akward (not very friendly) people at register, the place was filthy, the food was not great at all and we tried several items on the menu (about 5 different things). The fries were very greasy and mushy. The food was nothing to rave about. And the bathroom was disgusting. After seeing the bathroom, I really regretted stepping foot in there and eating! Not sure what the hype is about. Will not go back."
4,My absolute favorite place to eat. I have never had anything there that I haven't liked and am gradually working my way through the entire menu lol.
4,This place is great and the service is excellent. I had the falafel and hummus and hubby had the schwarma plate..both are excellent. The ambience is quaint and the server was so friendly and warm. I would go back again in a heart beat and will tell all that visit Vegas to try this place out.
3,"Great diner with tons of vegetarian and vegan options.   They even have the Trempeleau walnut burger!! My husband got the Elvis shake, which was beautiful and he must have liked because he gobbled it up."
1,"I just moved to Phoenix recently and I'm searching for a great massage spa. This is the first one I tried out. I got the regular Thai massage which is on a chair, just like in foot reflexology spas. The massage was basically that, but I've had better. I'd assume there would be something different to it being Thai but no. All in all the massage was okay. BUT WHO THE HELL MASSAGES THE SPINE WITH STRONG PRESSURE!"
4,Great beer? Check. Excellent cheese curds? Check. Standout service? Check. All I have to say is this place delivers. And Dan the bartender is as good as they get. Give that man a raise!
0,We were carrying many items around and didn't get offer a shopping bag!!! Terrible services!!
2,"My friend and I were stumbling our way to Earl of Sandwich inside the Miracle Mile Shops until we saw a designated drinking station.  We were both dehydrated, as he ordered his usual Johnny Walker Black and I went with Patron Silver.  I typically order a stiff drink but as soon as I saw their Patron machine that houses ice cold tequila, I couldn't resist.  The bar has a cool vibe and was pretty DOA. However, it was pretty early and most sensible tourists were shopping and enjoying ice cream.  I paid a cool $10 or so for my ice cold shot and we were on our way to some grub."
1,"I thought the strip was strange, but this place was overwhelming. There are some good highlights like the zipline and the stage performances and the ceiling vision show, but that's pretty much it. There are so much going on at the same time and it's too much to processed and we saw too many boobs and butt cheeks within the hour we were here. There were too much smoke from the casinos and I was literally gasping for clean air. Since I experienced the majority of this place, I'm done. Never again. The strip was so much more fun and chill and \""normal\""."
2,"Decent pho, but not my favorite in Charlotte.   Came here when my sisters came to town bc they are big fans of Vietnamese food.  \n\nWe ordered the raw beef dish, some spring rolls, and pho.  I didn't try anything but the pho, but my sisters said the raw beef plate and spring rolls were okay, but wouldn't eat beyond a few pieces.  The pho had too much star anise IMO.  That's the thing that gives pho, it's \""pho\""-ness.  And compared to other pho places, the prices were the same, but the noodles and meat was not plentiful.  \n\nThe service was really good and they were nice.  Just curteous and respectful and stuff like that.  The place is really clean.  Not much else to say about this place...nothing really exciting happened here.  \n\nI will probably go other places for pho.  \n\nOh, and no alcohol for sale here, but you can bring your own.  As it turned out, had some beers (unopened!) in the car, and they let us bring it inside.  \n\n\ndmo out."
4,"i'm not much of a sub fan, but i was blown away by what i got.  it was the new york steamer and it was the right amount of juicy without soaking through to the bread.  it melted in my mouth and tasted awesome.  it's a firehouse theme so it was cool that there was an actual firetruck out front- and city of Mesa firemen eating there.  I guess that was just a timing thing, but my son got a kick out of it.  Plus they've got one of those fancy digital Coke machines that are all the rage.  Too bad I gave up soda a year ago.  Hey, how bout a digital beer machine..."
3,"#1 Bros. is our local pizza joint and I'm an ex-NYer and we just love this place. The family is so nice, just like one of the last commenters...they guys will chat with us about sports or just whatever. They are so friendly and I love their food. They have great pizza, antipasto salad and I love their eggplant parmesan sub. \nIt's a great place for a quick slice or to take the family. I love that it is family owned and operated and it shows!"
3,"I watched this place as well as everything along durango by the park go up. i remember when it used to be a dirt lot. \n\nGreat location. SUPER convenient when need a fast and quick bite. Chevron is right there attached as well. \n\nOut of the many years its been open, i've only had 1 issue and it was so long ago, i dont remember what happened. I just remember they gave me more food as an apology.. Haha. \n\nDrive thru usually pretty fast."
4,Extremely friendly and patient. My onyx was attacked and required extensive medical care which took approx 8 months to treat. (Contracted MRSA in addition to the attack). They were understanding and patient in reference to monetary payments. They advise us on the best treatment options and completely explained all risks and answered my many many questions. I feel comfortable bringing my babies there for check ups shots and all other required visits.
2,"Review Update: \n\nIt had been about a year since I passed by Mi & Stu so I walked in today for their chocolate brownie and carrot cake muffin and was disappointed to find that I would have to buy 2xcarrot cake muffins (and not fresh - only frozen) and the fresh daily chocolate brownies cut rather small and are no longer wrapped with care with a little Mi & Stu label that list the contents (a bit of a no no in the land of specialty baked good stores methinks). I got home, steeped a nice pot of mint tea and unwrapped the brownie but the recipe seems to have changed as it was even more sugary than chocolate'y in my book and crumbled apart when I tried to take a bite. Still moist and with tiny chocolate chips but I won't be tempted as readily for this when next I pass by the store front. \n\nThey still stock lots of gluten free bread and frozen to-go cakes, brownies etc. I'd be curious to hear a review of their other wares but don't fancy the trial and error investment in this case.    \n\nPrior Review:\n\nA very minimally decorated to-go bakery - threadbare atmosphere-wise but DANG delicious food-wise. I'm an omnivore who, from time to time, cleanses, modifies my diet and tries to figure out what things I'm allergic to. Well, if I go gluten free (but not sugar-free...) I will be a regular at Mi & Stu's. I picked up one of their gluten, dairy and peanut free chocolate brownies and it was amazing. Chewy, dark chocolate square of heaven. I recommend sharing it with a friend though because it is chock full o' sugar and the effects are felt almost immediately. ZAAAANG! For a less sugary but equally delicious option try the carrot cupcake. MIAM! I believe this one was vegan but you'd never know it...dense and moist and, well, scrumptious! \n\nOther items in demand, according to the bakers there, include the mock rye bread and gluten-free bagels. I'll be giving them a try next time!"
4,"The food is awesome here! I love the chicken nachos and the tacos that they offer here! They are very loaded so you can probably can get filled up with two of them! They have a huge selection of beer which many people can appreciate, although I'm not a big fan of beer. It is packed here most of the time. The service is always great!"
1,"Went with a group of twelve.  Six of us got our food after one hour.  The other six waited another 30 minutes for their food.  Everyone agreed the food was excellent, but the service was abominable.  The server never came over to ask if everything was OK.  It took three tries before they got my bill right.  Two other things we didn't like.  The original restaurant on this site was cozy with a couple of small rooms.  They have enlarged it, so the original ambiance is gone.  Also they had a DJ playing so loud that conversation was impossible.  Not likely I will return, even though the food is excellent."
1,"Stopped in yesterday, was starving after a day at the Phoenix Open.  Read several Yelp reviews and felt like this would be a great place to eat.  Ordered the garlic knots, they were outstanding. Ordered a 18 inch onion, sausage and mushroom pizza.  Let me first say,  I think they forgot we ordered, our knots and pizza arrived at the same time and we waited for too much time. The knots were great, the pizza was flavorless.  That's the only way to describe it. I' m still trying to figure out how they made that pizza with no flavor.  Confused?"
4,"Amazing little neon diner with counter with stools inside and a large comfortable patio out, with umbrellas and heaters.  Sitting at the counter is the best, as its fun to chat with the bartender and watch the food being prepared in the tiny kitchen.  Best Old Fashioned ever and burger was specially good as well.  Beignets? Yes!\nVery fun place to go late night too."
1,"This is not to bash anyone. To be honest I really like Vi Vi, she ALWAYS remembers me and talks to me on a personal level, and she is very patient. But no amount of niceness in the world can make that wait bearable. I went in on Friday the 21 of December, I waited 40 minutes JUST to be seated. I remember she said come early because they are usually busy in the evening, well it worked perfect because I was heading to San Diego that evening. I went in around 2:09 PM, I was greeted by her husband. (Vi was in the back) he told me it would be a 20-30 minute wait which was an obvious lie. Another person came in right after me he told her a 30-40 minute wait. Little did I know that wait time was for me. They pass up A LOT of business people won'[t wait. And I personally don't blame them. To top it off because there is a wait they aren't through at all but have no problem charging me 65 bucks for a pedicure, and full set. I don't have any problem playing for good service but this service could be a LOT better. I have been going here for about three months, and I always tip. I am not a bad customer but for the money I pay I expect a lot more. \n\nMy advice find another place? I promise you won't regret it."
1,"When it first opened, my sister would rave about the food being so good. The good thing about the cafe is they use fresh ingredients & grow their own fruits and vegetables. I went there on Halloween & for the winter holidays because my family had the annual pass & my kids like to go to spring preserve. I'm sorry say, but every time I eat here,  I'm never satisfied with the flavors or how the food is cooked. I might just go there for recreation & save my cash & calories for something worth it."
1,"Place was interesting. The decor reminds you of \""cheers\"" because of the wood. I had a salmon wrap and it was very good. It had a mustard sauce and came with fries. Prices were decent. Our waitress lacked personality and her breath smelled bad, but she got everything.food wise right. It took awhile to bring our drinks. I split the check with my friend, and she didn't divide the items correctly.I probably wouldn't come here again because it wasn't \""special\"". If I'm coming all the way from Monroeville, then I want more bang for my buck."
0,"Before I start I want to say that the people working inside this facility are very nice.  It's very sad for them that they have zero tools to work with, that must be a very hard job.\n\nI went in with a request that I assumed, in 2014, would be fairly simple.  Scan and email some legal documents back to my mortgage company.  I was told the scanners were in the back, and the nice man pointed to some large printer-sized machines.  Not having seen a \""print-only\"" machine in a medium to large scale business (like a FedEx Business Center, or any business center for that matter) since 2003 I had assumed they were those multi-function machines that would be scanned from the workstation.  I was wrong.\n\nThe scanners were tiny letter-sized flatbed scanners hooked up to an old computer that loaded slowly and charged me $.49 per minute.  I would have paid it, honestly, if it scanned legal documents, but it didn't.  After speaking with the super nice guy at the workstation we discovered my only option within that building was a fax machine.   \n\nFebruary 12, 2014: The date in which I sent my first fax in this century, and I paid $35 to do it.  The worst part?  Fedex made me do it because they don't have the technology available to scan and email legal sized documents.  \n\nI'm 99.999% sure I didn't even fax from that fedex fax machine to another fax machine as much as I faxed to a computer that received faxes, because it's 2014 and technology happened in the last decade. \n\nOne star for the amazing and friendly people, but the other 4 are gone because Fedex should have technology that was made in this decade.  I'm equal parts shocked and annoyed at Fedex."
4,"This Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives joint is awesome. The grub is unique and affordable, and the prices are extremely low. It is not as \""cool\"" as I thought it would be, but perhaps it is because it changed owners or something like that.\n\nIt is a little past its 50's atmosphere though; it is more updated in terms of decor, but it still holds on to a tad of the grease spot flare.\n\nMy Killer Pimp dog offered fried green tomatoes, pimento cheese, and a weenie on Texas toast. At $3, it was a great filling and messy piece of grub. The pimento cheese was creamy, and the pickles were thick cut and provided a crunch.\n\nI guess a lot of people dislike the change in ownership or whatever, but I enjoyed my experience there, so I do not have anything against the change. Sorry! Head to The Penguin if you are in Charlotte."
1,"Took my Mom and BFF to lunch and we were so disappointed when the server came back to tell us there was NO duck today.  What?!  Today?  Or just at lunch time?  We placed our orders with pork, chicken, and beef then proceeded to ask our server if the restaurant was out of duck today or just at lunch.  It was really bugging me.  The menu shows duck as an option all over the place.  She said that we were the only people who ever ordered duck.  Ever?  Like, as in EVER ever?  She said yes.  Well, I knew that was a lie.  My BFF orders duck from this place on a regular basis, but that's at dinner.  So, I asked if she meant that duck wasn't available at lunch only.  She smiled and said she wasn't sure.  Poor thing.  The kitchen did her no favors by being so lazy.\n\nOn a side note, a bazillion years ago my Mom taught us kiddos to check out the restrooms.  If they're clean, you know the kitchens are clean...  Eeewwww....  I was not pleased with the lady's room.  Paper was on the floor and it was smelly.  Thank goodness one of the soap dispensers worked.  Another eeewww, when I got back to the table - there was a fly hovering around.  Gross.\n\nLunch orders consisted of Broccoli Delight with beef: bland, overcooked veggies;\nPa-Nang curry with chicken: yummy, light on the chicken, overkill on the green peppers; and, Mango curry with pork, yummy, light on the pork\n\nTwo stars because I felt bad for our server and two of three dishes were yummy.  But don't forget what I said about the bathroom...  Scary.  We shan't be visiting this location anytime soon - more likely we'll give the family owned restaurant a second chance at the Mesa location."
3,"I loved Second Cup!  When I leave the US I vow to stay away from Starbucks and Second Cup made this not only possible, but quite enjoyable!  Prices are high (but everything is higher in Canada!), but the coffee is rich and the carrot cake here is fluffy and rich but not too sweet or heavy!  \nAlso, I can't forget to mention the free wifi access if you are a tourist that does't want to rack up roaming charges :)"
3,"Food is good here, and the price is reasonable.\nI meet here a few times a month for a networking group I'm a part of.  The have a nice room in the back for large groups to meet.  Service and selection of always good."
2,Normal Hawaiian restaurant. Food is good but nothing too special. It's conveniently located by my school so my classmates & I eat here like once a month. \n\nThai tea is good. Boba not so much. It's not soft and chewy like it should be. The middle is still kind of hard and I've ordered boba twice thinking it was just a 1 time thing but no.
3,"Alexi's is a Phoenix classic. Great food, great service, but old menu. \n\nYou can always count on Alexi's for a good meal, of epic proportions that will be very filling."
1,"I had high expectations coming to pure. Considering it's located at the great caesers palace.  Although it's an older nightclub. It is very much still popular. So why not check it out. I had a friend of mine put us on the guest list which was no problem. Guest list closed roughly about 12am. Not bad. So Me and my group show up around 11:15 or so. First thing I noticed was the wild zoo of a crowd standing outside to get in. Somehow I knew this was going to be a long night. I couldn't understand why there was no standard line. You had general admission, bottle service, and guest list line all in one cattle of a heard outside the venue. Why its this way is beyond me. Anyway I managed to weasel my way thru the unsung crowd of people with my party of three. The bouncers at the front were actually pretty nice. They checked my name on their which was once a clipboard with paper now an iPad. And let us in with five minutes to spare on the guest list. I was so close to greasing these guys. I wasn't about to let me and my group pay cover. Upon entering we hit the bar. I order two margaritas, two la waters, and two cranberry vodkas. A hefty 90$. With tip of course. No biggie. It was pretty crowded this being Friday night. The decor is nice but very mediocre. Venue is also kinda small. But the outside was pretty neat. With a nice view of the strip. Music was so so. An ok mix of hip hop,top 40 and electro. The crowd here was really boring. I'd say there was five guys per girl which is unacceptable. Especially in a Vegas nightclub. Most of the good-looking people all had booths with bottle service. No joke. And I'd say more than half the people here were well over 40. Kinda depressing. Me and my group ended up leaving before 2am. It was that boring there. This place really needs to step up their game. There are way to many other clubs to check out before this one. I probably won't be coming here unless I'm getting bottle service or something. So hey at least I was able to get my and my group in free. Which is always a good thing."
4,"Looks to be just your standard restaurant, but inside are things that make you go Mmm. \n\nHen House Burger is phenomenal. Simple concept of adding an egg to a burger, we've seen it before but Holstein's does it right. Expect to make a mess with this one.\n\nThe Steakhouse Burger with a peppered patty, steak sauce - and other perfectly combined ingredients - was mind-blowing too.  I couldn't make a decision to which burger was best. Each time I had one bite of one and then the other, I said \""this one is best!\"".  They were both that good. And the fries were equally as good - some crispy, some soft - great flavor. The boyfriend and I agree this place is on our list of Top 5 burgers (probably Top 3 for me!).  \n\nCaptain Crunch Shake with vodka ... if you like Captain Crunch you'll love this! I wanted to try it based on the waitress's recommendation. No regrets, but I'll go with something that has chocolate in it next time - and there WILL be a next time.\n\nAlcoholic beverages are stiff, service was quick (but also, I went pretty late), and the waitress was down to earth."
3,Delicious sushi! Lots of variety. Good drinks. Great for lunch and dinner! Full bar. Also they have coupons time to time on GroupOn. Would recommend.
4,"I wish this place were in central Phoenix where I live, the chicken dishes were fantastic, the wine sauces amazing, I can't wait to visit my friend Karen again so we can return.  You will not be disappointed in tgis place"
4,We tried this place out while we were visiting my parents in Cave Creek. There were 8 of us and they sat us almost immediately. I had the rouladen which was to die for. It was so good I asked the server if I could have another one just as a side order - no problem at all. My wife had the gyros which see said repeatedly that it was the best gyros she has had.\nThis place makes you feel at home and it is to comfortable. We stayed there for almost 3 hours.\nThank you Heaven's K!
2,"I was first recommended by Capezio by my daughter's ballet theatre. They said we receive 10% discounts there, so my mom and I decided to give it a try.\n\nCustomer service is great. There's this girl that works there and she helped us out as much as she could, and she was extremely nice and friendly. I never once got a bad vibe from her.\n\nDespite their pretty good customer service here, I would have to deduct two stars. Why, you ask? Well, they didn't have two out of the three items that I needed for my daughter's ballet class. They didn't have the leotard or the socks that my little girl needed :/ They said they would call when the shipment would come in, but I still haven't heard from them..\n\nOh well, would definitely come back here and shop for my daughter's ballet equipment since it's closer to us than the other ballet stores that I know about."
4,"Great food and great people. You wouldn't know this place was there unless you were looking for it. Give it a try, you won't regret it! Oh and the sweet iced tea is perfectly made!"
0,Worst Wendy's I've ever been too.  Went in over a year ago for breakfast special.  Waited in line for 20 minutes and then the order was all messed up.  Long and short.  Too many other good places out there.  Don't waste your time..
2,"Fine place to stop and have a beer.  Just a little bar, tv's and some games.  Johnny Cash seemed to be the theme coming from the jukebox which I had no problem with, it fits the place well."
0,"So, I ate there on Wednesday and it is now Friday.  I have not had solid food or been able to keep anything down since I went there.  In an area that has so many great places don't go there.  Keep driving east on Camelback and hit one of the many other restaurants on that street."
4,"Props to Chef Jay.  My wife didn't want to cook tonite, so she hit up the old faithful Groupon site and came up with Paparazzi in the O'Aces Bar just off the 215.  I have been to my fair share of combo bar/grills in Vegas and didn't have the highest of expectations.  Put aside your preconceptions and be prepared to be blown away.  \n\nThe menu is compact, but diverse.  There is a good selection of appetizers, burgers, entrees, pizzeria items and a couple desserts.  I had the braised shortribs on wild mushroom risotto and it was excellent.  The chive infused oil drizzled around the edge was a nice subtle addition.  Wife had had the spiced shrimp over grits.  She loved it.  \n\nThey were finishing up with a Lions club meeting when we arrived and the chef noticed we didn't yet have menus and came out and did waiter duty till his waiter was free.  Service was great, and as noted in other reviews the chef was out checking on his customers and took the time to chat with us and get our impressions of what we had ordered.  You get two separate checks--one from the bar for drinks, and one from the restaurant.  Bar prices are decent and the restaurant prices are quite reasonable\n\nThis one is a definite keeper........"
0,Called few days in advance and asked if non-guests could use the pool.  Sure the lady said for $20 a person.  No problem and even told her what day we would be there and that we would be there before noon.  Got there and was told it's $175 for non-guests to use the pool...OMG!!  After being there and seeing the state of the place and how gross and crowded it was so happy I didn't bother with their pool.
4,"Welcome to Charlotte, Tupelo Honey Cafe! Yelpers, get ready to have your taste buds delighted. \n\nI've been anxiously awaiting Tupelo Honey's arrival to the Charlotte food scene. I've heard nothing but amazing things about it but the 1.5-2 hour wait at the one in Asheville left me pining away. But not anymore, as we have our very own! It fills the space once occupied by the Pewter Rose Bistro.\n\nWe were lucky enough to join Tupelo Honey Cafe for a soft opening tonight. Usually restaurants use soft openings to work out kinks and problems, but it didn't seem like they really needed it. Everything was already operating like a smooth oiled machine. The service was excellent and the food was all superb. They were serving a limited menu but there was still something for everyone. \n\nHomemade Pimento Cheese and Tortilla Chips - Awesome. The pimento cheese was served hot, reminiscent of a Southern version on queso dip. The chips were also hot and fresh. \n\nBiscuits: Fresh biscuits served with Tupelo honey and berry jam. So.Freakin.Good. My search for the best biscuit has ended. Tupelo wins. These biscuits are light, fluffy, flaky, buttery, salty, and just damn good. \n\nSHOO-Mercy Shirmp and Grits: Oh man. A dozen perfectly cooked, succulent shrimp with bacon, caramelized onions, spinach, and sauteed mushrooms all served over goat cheese grits... Read that again... Goat cheese grits! If you aren't a fan of goat cheese, skip this dish as it is a very dominant flavor. Or better yet, try them and you may discover that goat cheese isn't all that bad like I did :) \n\nI also tried the Southern Fried Chicken Saltimbocca. So, so, so good. The chicken was perfectly cooked. So juicy. The country ham, Havarti and Marsala sauce pushed the dish over the top. The cheese smashed cauliflower were a bit of a let down. They just weren't as exciting as I wanted them to be. \n\nFinished the dinner off with a piece of Bourbon Pecan Pie. Perfect crust. Tons of pecans on top and ooey gooey pecan pie filling in the middle. You could smell the butter in every bite. Definitely the perfect desert for those with a sweet tooth. \n\nSide notes... They share the parking lot with The Liberty. They are on the second floor. There are two staircases and an elevator you can use to get up to them. The patio looks awesome! Can't wait for the weather to get nice to enjoy it. The space inside is beautiful. I love the exposed brick. They have a really nice bar area with TVs and a great selection of local beers on tap and tasty cocktails. Their mint iced tea was a bit on the sweet side for me but I loved the fresh mint flavor. Our waitress, Kat, was very friendly and attentive.\n\nI can't wait to try out more of their menu!! See you soon Tupelo Honey Cafe :)"
4,"Love this place! I ADORE the Southern Hussy! My husband loves the magic in the ivy, both fresh and regular. Fantastic service every time too. Always friendly and on top of it!"
4,"It's a massive jam jar full of delicious, hang over fixing, spicy, beery, Bloody Mary. It's topped with a pickle, olives, lemon, lime, sausage links and a damn breakfast sandwich. It's brunch, it's a snack, it's fucking amazing. I saw it sitting next to me, and I blushed like a virgin.\n\nOn a Sunday early afternoon, the place was lively and full of happy brunch folk. Great atmosphere for beers and food and watching whatever sports you like on tv. Everyone behind and around the bar was friendly and engaging in conversation, pretty much everyone felt like a friend. \n\nI would totally come back! Again and again and again..."
2,"Pretty much everything you need in a well located hotel can be found here. This hotel is in a great location--close to transit and within walking distance of just about everything you could need. \n\nThey offer a continental breakfast that featured bagels, croissant, bread (for toast), yogurt, hard boiled eggs, beans, cheese, mixed fruits, oatmeal, cereal, coffee, tea, juice, hot chocolate, espresso. The hours are good, 6am-10am and 11am on weekends. The breakfast was self-serve and, except for the odd guest who blocked the toaster and plate area, was a pleasant experience in the morning. The staff kept the breakfast room well stocked and clean.\n\nThe room was decent. The beds were a bit squeaky, but not unbearably so. We liked that we had control of the heat. The room had a fridge, stove, desktop computer, coffee pot, and TV. It was convenient to have a computer in the room, except that everything was in French and there wasn't a way to switch it to English. It is also worth noting that there is free WiFi; it's really easy to get on, but we did find it to be sluggish. We made use of the TV and DVD player, both worked well (the remote may have needed new batteries though). \n\nThe bathroom had heated floors, but we couldn't figure out how to turn it on. The glass shower enclosure was lovely and easy to use. And while the height of the shower head is adjustable, it doesn't have much depth--you're basically standing in the corner the whole time. Water pressure was a bit low, but the temperature was great and easily adjustable. On a couple of occasions, when we came back to the room the bathroom had a weird odour (other reviewers have had similar experiences). It wasn't super awful and it did go away. Housekeeping did a great job refreshing the towels and complimentary toiletries every day. \n\nThe staff were polite and easy to talk to. However, not particularly knowledgeable about tourist activities and unable to really provide recommendations. They were great with directions and looking up information for us though."
2,"I've had a gift certificate burning a hole in my pocket since February.  Summer is just about over so I went looking for a store.  Seems 3 of the ones near me have closed up in the past few years.  I found this one on the North side of MetroCenter in the same strip mall as Fatburger and a bunch of other stuff.  There was plenty of parking.\n\nThe store was clean.  Plenty of parking.  Not very busy.  I am definitely showing my age when it bothers me having the young man making my creation with a two day old growth and several pieces of \""art\"" in his nose and other parts of his face.  Getting past that, he was efficient and pleasant to deal with.  It was slow so we had a brief conversation about the number of remaining stores in the West side.\n\nI had a cheesecake signature creation, med.  It was good but I have been spoiled by Sweet Republic.  I still have some money left on the gift card so I know I will be back again to some location."
4,"Wow. Nothing wrong with this little place. I Yelped for a decent restaurant in the New Town section and this caught my eye along with a nice recommend from Emily V. \n\nJust me and the kids. Thing 1 and Thing 2 split some nachos and I had the Colorado Burrito and a margarita. Fast and friendly service and great tasting, fresh, savory, authentic, simple food. As good as I've had just about anywhere. Yum."
1,"I was told the Philly Cheese Stake Sandwich was the best in town by a person from New Jersey.  Maybe they are what Jersey people are used to, but they don't even come close to the same sandwich at Uncle Sam's.  I couldn't even find the grilled onions and the cheese whiz, just the sadly bland meat.  The fries were good.\n\nThe setting is noisy and has the feel of a college campus eatery."
1,"Overview: Yellowtail is a Japanese restaurant for people who are afraid of Japanese food.\n\nWhen my wife and I went to Vegas for our anniversary, Yellowtail at Bellagio very nearly ruined it. For background: My mother is Japanese, and I've been fortunate enough to visit many times. I don't need my Japanese food to be authentic, but it does have to taste good.\n\nYellowtail's food is neither authentic nor good. The glazed salmon I ordered was soaked in a sugar sauce, sweet to the point of being inedible. (My theory: To cover up the fact they serve cheap salmon.)\n\nTo their credit, when my waiter came over, he immediately asked me what was wrong. When I told him, he quickly replaced the dish with something edible but completely forgettable. (The good service is the only thing that brings Yellowtail up to two stars.) My wife had a similar experience. The food is more \""Japanese-y\"" than Japanese.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I had a severe stomach ache for the rest of the night - a distraction to say the least when I was trying to enjoy Cirque du Solei. The Bellagio hotel staff were completely unhelpful to the point of belligerence, but that's a story for another time.\n\nMy wife and I are already planning our next trip to Vegas. We would have considered staying at the Bellagio. But after our experience with Yellowtail (and Bellagio), we're going back to the Wynn. They certainly know how to treat customers well there."
1,"Though I've always been pleased there in the past, tonight  was most unpleasant.  It was incredibly hot and stuffy which they blamed on the \""humidity.\""  What happened to air conditioning?  It took a half hour to get chips.  Our orders took even longer and were not correct.  We didn't send them back simply because we didn't have the time.  I hope this is an isolated incident.  I would hate to lose a favorite restaurant."
2,"Can't comment on the atmosphere here as when I ate there a couple of Sundays ago my party of three was the only table due to the early hour we'd booked. Decor-wise there are plenty of tasty old French posters along with a fair amount of artfully shot b&w stills. We were at a loss as to whether these last were meant to be squint on the walls or not. Given the size of the place it was all to easy to hear the banter of the staff at the counter whilst we ate and at times this was a bit intrusive. I would expect though that this is not the case when the restaurant is anywhere near full. My appetite was sadly lacking on the day but the chicken liver terrine wrapped in bacon was tasty (some biscuits would have been handy though as the dish was more the consistency of pate) as was the cheese, leek and potato dish I had as a main course. The rest of the party enjoyed their mushroom crepe and steak respectively. All in all a reasonable experience but I think Edinburgh has better French restaurants than this to offer. Ate here again a couple of Mondays ago and can't I'm afraid justify an increase of stars as yet. Whilst both my pate starter (served sans biscuits so thank goodness for the basket of bread) and main of beef daube were well sized & tasted great (and at 2 courses for \u00a312 prior to 18:45 excellent vfm) the salmon main course looked to be too simplistic and lacking in taste, service was rather impersonal and we had to wait quite a while until the bill was proferred."
0,"Horrible hotel, horrible customer service.  Dirty rooms and elevators that don't work. Don't get stuck in the elevator here - and if you do, the alarm won't work, the phone won't work and they don't care.    They like to argue with customers and EVERYTHING is not their fault."
3,"My husband and I went out for our usual Friday date nights and wanted to try a restaurant featuring Latin cuisine.  Inka Heritage specializes in traditional Peruvian dishes.\n\nThough given large seafood portions (including a piece of lobster, calamari, shrimp and fish) cooked in the acid of lime juice, we weren't too fond of the ceviche appetizer.\n\nWe were very pleased with our main dishes, the Lomo Inka Heritage and the Tacu Tacu Con Lomo Saltado.  Their chef definitely knows how to prepare a wonderfully seasoned and flavorful tenderloin.\n\nWe topped of the evening with an amazing Tres Leches cake which comes highly recommended to those of you with a sweet tooth.  For something new, try their traditional Peruvian non-alcoholic drink with a complex mixture of juices."
2,"This place is sterile, and set up like a cafeteria.  The audio system is likely blaring Texas style contemporary country music. \n\nThe theme is Texas BBQ, not African-American, or North Carolina or Kansas City.  They have a system where you stand in line and tell the counter man what entree you want, plus a couple of side dishes, and he shouts it over his shoulder to the cook who plates it up for you on a tray.  Then you slide the tray to the cashier and select a drink.  You carry your own tray to a table you choose and they do the clean-up.\n\nBrisket is a specialty.  Sauce can be ordered hot, mild or mixed.  They also do a sliced turkey.  Meats can be bare on a plate or in a sandwich.\n\nIts very casual, TV sets constantly going, of course, because this is America."
1,"I was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.  I ordered crab ragoon, chicken lomein, sweet and sour pork, and steamed meat dumplings.  I got delivery, which was fast & courteous.  Overall the food was extremely greasy, I mean literally dripping with grease.  I'm wondering if they need to increase the temperature of the deep fryer and or wok.  I'm no chef, but I've read that if the oil is not hot enough that the food will retain too much oil. The filling for the crab ragoon was as another reviewer mentioned some of the best tasting I've ever had, but it was ruined by the dripping grease.  The sweet & sour pork was almost all breading with very little meat.  I'll be trying another restaurant next time."
2,"I've eaten at various Primanti Brothers locations, usually this one on Forbes, but they're all pretty similar.\n\nFirst, it's a Pittsburgh institution, so I definitely recommend eating here if you're only in Pittsburgh for a few days.  It's unique, you get an unholy amount of food for pennies on the dollar.  In fact, for total calories per dollar, Primanti Brothers could compete in a national championship. \n\nOn the other hand, you have to tell it like it is.  The service is horrible, and when they're busy (which seems like always), you will stand in line forever.  It's pretty impersonal, although it is impressive to watch the cooks.  It's also fun to listen to the arteries clogging all around you.\nJust based on medical advice, I would not recommend eating here more than once in your life, but you should definitely eat here once."
2,"I like Paradise, don't get me wrong.  They've got some good salads, and they don't blink an eye when you start asking for more of this and less of that as they're putting them together but if they want more stars, they're going to have to bring back that chicken (or was it turkey) sandwich with the chipotle aioli, avocado and jicama slices.  THAT WAS SO GOOD!  Back in the good old days when I worked at the interior design company we were out tagging furniture at some model homes for reuse and we ate at Paradise two days in a row because that sandwich was so good.  Alas, no more sandwich and only three stars.  You bring back my sandwich, I'll give you your stars."
4,"I love them here.  Always been a great experience.   Best doctors ever, very caring.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!!!!"
1,"We were excited for a night out. My wife had oral surgery last week and the moment she was up to it we decided to eat out and chose Tommy V's. The experience was iffy. Jeff, our bartender made our drinks but forgot to give them ot us to drink. He was hangin' and pretty relaxed so we left it at that but then it was time for dinner..more than 30mins after ordering we still don't have food. No bread, no salad, no apology,so we asked for bread or something and were informed that our food will be out in 15seconds. Welp, ten minutes later we get the bread. The food finally comes but without the drink that I ordered with it. The salmon ok. My wifes gnocci with short ribs was delicious. - the saving grace. So we give Jeff our card to pay and wait.and wait. and wait while he closes out his friends and flirts with 2 girls (seemed to be employed by this company) at the bar next to us.He looks up and as an aferthought processes our bill. We get our check and give mr. jeff the high 5 that he's been seeking from every other guest through the evening and leave feeling very disappointed about the whole experience. It alsom must be mentioned that the restaurant was empty. There were maybe 4 people at the bar and two tables filled. \n."
2,"Typical burger joint. Lots of toppings to chose from. Burger is flat. Needs to be spiced up. It's cooked well and not dry at all. The little fries that I ordered fed 4 of us. Mushrooms were canned. Total for the burger and large drink was about $12. Service was good, soda fountain lots to chose from also. Free peanuts while u wait."
4,I have been taking my  whole family to Dr. Janssen for about 10 months now and they have been a tremendous help in promoting healing and being healthy!  I had constant migraines and other major health issues that have been resolved because of Dr. Janssen!  We all enjoy the friendly and positive energy in their office!  I highly recommend Dr. Janssen to all!
0,1 Day from temporary tag expiration so called DMV and they said the dealer has yet to process the tags.
4,"Club promoter said he'd get my girlfriends and I in, no cover charge, if we came by 10:30 so XS was our first stop of the night during our clubbing hopping spree Saturday night.  There isn't much to say except that this is truly the hottest club in Vegas right now.  The venue is striking and so are the people inside. \n\nBottom line: come dressed to impress and make sure this is on your list of places to check out when you come party in Vegas because it's too hot to pass up."
1,"Both times that I've gone to Drybar I leave with my hair looking pretty good, but an hour later the curls have fallen out and my hair has gone flat."
2,"Made my first visit to Brixx this past Friday night. Boy, it was a madhouse! Very loud and very limited seating inside. I managed to get an inside table thanks to a large group leaving eventually. The pizza I ordered was ok. Nothing too memorable though. My waiter was great though."
2,"Good paninis, decent drinks.  Must come back for one of their phenomenal looking desserts.  Great prices!\n\nApparently this is a perfect place to come as a student with laptop etc... they are friendly and let you sit"
0,"DIRTY.  Dirty, dirty, dirty.   I was excited to have a corner suite at Aria, but I sat on my couch and pulled a pair of dirty women's underwear out from under a couch cushion.  Then, in the awesome bathroom, I dropped my hairbrush on the floor, and when I bent down to get it, there were 4 Xanax on the floor, under the vanity.  Neither of the above items were mine; we had just checked in.  I asked to change rooms and a room upgrade, and they told me that would be difficult.  They put an equal room on hold for me, but I couldn't get into it until 6pm the FOLLOWING day.   Really more of a hassle to move rooms.  Then, later in my stay, as I was walking from the shower to my room, I sliced the bottom of my foot open on a carpet staple/nail that was loose.  Hurts like hell.   Since I had already officially \""checked out\"" online early that morning, they wouldn't do anything about that.   For all of this, in a 48 hour stay, after talking with the management for a day and a half, they finally offered me a $100 credit on anything inside the hotel.  $100 does not buy 1 show ticket, or 1 spa treatment.  I still had to spend more money there.   I could not use $100 on food, since I was at a work conference. Some BS if you ask me.  I will not return to the Aria, would not recommend it, and will not stay there next year, if the conference is there again."
1,"My husband and I had breakfast here about a month ago and now that I am sitting down to do the review I find that neither of us can remember what we ate or how the service was or anything remarkable about the experience at all.  It was completely forgettable.  If you like generic chain restaurant breakfasts, then this place is for you."
1,"Went here when it newly opened...so dont remember much. We grabbed drinks at the bar area, and they gave us samples of their Wood Grilled Thin Crust Pizza....and that's what drew us in. Their apps/sides are good, but the steaks are ok. Whenever I crave for pizza I always think of Brand!"
2,"I think I came here on the wrong day. Yeah it has some high end food, but honestly I don't think it was worth the $28.95 for dinner on a Tuesday. I mean I've had it before, but it was on a Friday and that was a few years ago. Back then, the food was amazing so I guess I can see why its much better on the weekends.\n\nThey had chicken wellington, but it was too dry for my taste. I helped myself to a lot salmon nigiri, but the rice was too pasty. I do like how the slab of salmon is just right and not too puny like at the Mirage. They had this cooking station that made this French dish where you pick your seafood, veggies, and type of sauce poured onto the kind of bread used for wellington. My creation consisted of salmon, scallops, and shrimp mixed with onions, tomatoes, peppers. All of the following were stir fried then mixed in with pesto sauce. I don't remember the actual name of the dish, but it was one of the very few things I enjoyed. That and the pesto mashed potatoes. Hmmm, I guess I have a thing for pesto sauce. \n\nBesides the dishes I just mentioned, my meal wasn't that memorable. For 29 doll hairs I expected better. Not bad, but not that great. Go on the weekend. it may be more expensive, but they have better food."
3,"Okay, my review sums it all up in a text that I sent to my boyfriend several hours after eating a Frisco Burger w/o tomato, small order of curly fries and a small diet coke.\nText message:\n\""Don't tell anyone but I ate at Hardee's today and it was like real restaurant quality. Well just the food part. I didn't eat it all b/c 1) I couldn't and 2) I wanted some for later.\""\n\nI was driving while eating it and I kept saying out loud how good the burger was. Mind you, I was totally alone. And I didn't go in the restaurant but it looked clean from the drive-thru window and that woman who took my order did a better than average job. I was kind of put off by their prices but it was totally worth every penny!"
4,"Everyone should go to a drive in movie at least once in their lives, and Phoenix is damn lucky to still have one.\n\nMy family loves this place.\n\nI saw Escape from New York here way back in 1981 with my parents.  And while my parents were transfixed on the action movie in front of them, my little brother and I were looking out the back window in utter amazement at the cartoon Heavy Metal playing across the drive in...hehehe...  (Boy, was THAT an eye opener for a couple of doe eyed kids who'd only seen G-Rated cartoons like Looney Toons up to that point!)\n\nAnyway, this is THE place to go if you are taking babies or fidgety, wiggly, talkative little children to see a movie....that pretty much describes MY kids.  Mom and dad can watch a movie and tend to their chatty, wiggle-worms without disturbing the other patrons.\n\nAnother huge bonus is that you can bring in your own food from the outside so you can make it a very budget friendly night out and bring a $5 pizza and bottled water from home.  Although they do keep their admission prices extremely low, it's no secret that they hope to backfill that financial loss by purchases from the concession stand, so please do the theater management a huge favor and at least buy some popcorn.  ;)  \n\nWe definitely WANT this drive in to stay in business, it's one the last ones in the country.  :)  \n\nAnd for those that worry incessantly that they'll be 'jacked' or shot at while going to the west side, please don't.  The west side may have some sketchy looking neighborhoods and a little more graffiti, but there are plenty of dodgy, crime infested holes in pockets of the east valley too.  Most of the people in old Glendale are just normal folk like you and me, raising kids, paying bills and clipping coupons to get by.  Cut them a break and try not to look down your nose at them or stereotype them too badly while you enjoy this gem of a drive in on the west side...\n\nIn fact, to do my part I'm taking my whole litter here this Saturday because it's cheap (and I'm broke) and little ones desperately want to see ParaNorman.  Should be fun!"
4,"THIS is my favorite bar in Montreal. Live music pretty much every night and can be anything from bluegrass, country, punk, hardcore, heavy metal \\m/. Bar staff are friendly and will be talkative if it isn't too busy. Also dog friendly if not to crowded. Great spot to catch a last pint before closing time. Avoid if you don't like fun."
4,"Working in Downtown Phoenix, I have many options for lunch but I usually end up finding myself at Streets of New York.  The manager - Jimmy is an extremely friendly gentleman who always greets us with a smile and a handshake.  Our server Lupe takes care of us like no other.  We never wait for refills or food, we're always in and out quickly.  All of the food here is good from the wings to the sandwiches and broaster chicken.  We've been coming here for years and it's never been bad.\n\nIf you're in the area and wanting good quality food, definitely stop in and have lunch at this Streets location.  I've been to a few other locations throughout the valley but none of them measure up to the consistency, quality and friendly staff that exists at the Camelback location."
0,"I'm with Mike B. I have visited 2 Fox & Hound Bars now (the other up in Huntersville) - both get two thumbs down on the food. \n\nBoth had good beer selection, TVs, and space. \n\nBut the food - no. I got the fish sandwich at the Huntersville location - poor choice. I got the chicken sandwch at the Tryon location - looked like it belonged on the kids menu; and it took 30 minutes, so it was also dry. I initially thought I'd give the place a 2nd chance - 2 for 2 bad food experiences is enough."
0,"Service was horrible. Ordered drive thru 15 min at the window.  Got home. 6 min drive, and all tacos were cold. Called and phone is fax line. Worse the screwed up the order.....is watched him pack a box then unpack the box, pack another box then repack the first box."
3,My Parents and grandparents stayed the weekend and thought it was decent for the money.  The check-in person was too young to really guide where to go besides the obvious.  There was a mismatch for my parents age range but the front desk person was ok.  With all the Sr's traveling they may want to have someone who can speak Sr.\nThe rooms were nicely decorated.  Location is near a nice park (right out the door) and close enough to drive to most tourist spots.  Its an older redecorated place that is worth a visit.
2,"A good hot dog? yes.  Five stars good? No way.  \nI have driven by plenty of times and thought about stopping but I have to be in a certain mood to have hot dogs, so when my daughter wanted to take me out for Father's day, I decided it was time to check out JJ's.\n\nWe arrived at 11:30 and I was surprised to find that we were the only people in the place. Usually not a good sign, but I had read so many glowing reviews we assumed that the rush would catch up with us later.\n\nThere was plenty of help behind the counter and they were eager to take our order. I had the Char dog with mustard, chili and slaw, my daughter had the Fryder man which had cheese, chili and french fries on the dog. We both had fries and we got an order of onion rings to share. I'll list the highs and lows:\n\nService was very good and the gang behind the counter was attentive but the kitchen was a little slow since we were the only ones there. Not too bad if you consider they make everything from scratch but keep it in mind if you plan to run in for a quick lunch and are on a schedule.\n\nThe star of the show is their hot dogs and their wieners were very good.  Nice char, mildly seasoned and clean tasting.  Natural casing made for a nice bite.  They are so mild that the flavor of the wiener is lost with most of the toppings.  Chili was good and reminded me of my Mom's homemade recipe.  The buns taste like a potato bun and they are nicely toasted but nothing special.\n\nFrench fries are just OK.  could be frozen, i don't know. They are cooked well but nothing special.  Mine were a little greasy.  The onion rings were a big disappointment.  The first order was cold.  I mean like they had been in the refrigerator cold. They cooked us another order but by that time we were halfway through our dogs.  They were very greasy and not all that good anyway.\n\nWe got a couple dogs to go and i like the to-go containers.  Kept them safe and sound all the way home.\n\nBottom line is they make a good hot dog, everything else seems to suffer.  If I go back I will try the sausages, they had a pretty good selection.  If you are into crazy topping combinations and locally brewed beer on the roof, then this is probably your place."
1,"This place is overrated!\n\nMy friend and I went here for Sunday Brunch. For $25 a pop, I expected to be wowed with variety and flavor but I was greatly disappointed. =(\n\nWhen we first walked in, I was welcomed by the awesome food aroma and massive buffet area.  I immediately checked-in and posted a quick tip about the sight of hella food. Not! I am writing this review to take that back.  We though there was hella food but 10 minutes into the buffet, we found out that the left and right side of the buffet were serving the same kind of dishes. Really really disappointed!  \n\nThere weren't enough hot dishes to choose from and the omelette station was so swamped it wasn't worth waiting in line. One thing though, there were hella desserts and baked breads but they weren't tempting to eat at all.\n\nOur server was super nice! Half-star goes to her even though she forgot my water.  Prolly ain't coming back though, the quality and quantity of food served ain't $25 worthy."
3,"The burgers here look great, sound great, taste good but are overpriced.  The fries and onion rings are good as well.  The real superstar at Holsteins is their adult milk shakes omg to die for!"
2,"The cardio room is small and almost always packed. The last 5 times I've tried to get on a machine I've only been successful 2 times. The women's locker room always seems to have a draft in it no matter what time of year; it could also use a revamp. Compared to the Harris or Siskey Y's women's locker rooms this one is a bit antiquated. \n\nI've taken an array of cardio and yoga group fitness classes at this location (with different instructors) and have more often than not been disappointed at the quality. If I'm not breaking a sweat 20 minutes into a cardio dance class, something is wrong w the instructor/routine. \n\nA definite plus side to this Y is its location. Actually, this could sway a health and fitness seeker one of two ways - passing by NoDa's restaurants and bars can either motivate you to earn that reward meal/drink or it can cause you to skip a scheduled workout session to sooner enjoy said meal/drink.\n\n Not my fave Y in town but it's also not my least fave."
0,"So had high hopes as I brought colleague's here for breakfast. We were sat in a very nice dining room and the staff was friendly as well as attentive. When the food arrived a little to quickly as if it was cooked some time in advance we realized it indeed was. Eggs...cold, bacon.....cold, chocolate almond croissant bland and the opposite of flaky definitely not made fresh.Not what I expected of Bouchon. Very disappointed in there deliverable."
0,"I want to like this place.  I have tried extremely hard to like this place.  I have gone three times doing lunch, twice with a co-worker and once with my girlfriend.  First of all, we all loved the atmosphere.  The anime girls serving the food, the little cards, the pictures and anime on the TV are all exceptional.  It has all the makings of a very successful ramen house.\n\nThe problem is the food is simply horrible!  I am writing this short review with my stomach in cramps.  We have tried between us approximately half a dozen dishes.  None of us are really picky eaters either.  \n\nI had to listen to my girlfriend complain for over a day about how bad the food was and how it upset her stomach.  My co-worker swears that he will never go back due either.  Some of the seafood in his ramen bad gone \""bad\"".\n\nI think the place really goes for atmosphere with low quality food to cut costs."
0,"Worst customer service you can come across!  Stood at the front desk for atleast 3 minutes while 2 employees finished up their personal conversation.  I was there to buy a galaxy tab so she took my name and told me it would be 15 to 20 minutes.  I kind of lost time because I was sending texts and emails while I waited.  I noticed a lot of people started to complain so I looked at the time since my first text message was sent and it had been 45 minutes!  I went to the counter and asked where I was on the list,  she told me it would be 15 to 20 minutes!  When I told her she said that 45 minutes ago she snaps back and says \""sir these are estimates only\"" which at that point I turned around and walked out.  I wasted almost an hour of my time and they could care less.  I work in an industry where we have long wait times as well so I get it but it's all about how you come off to customers which most of the time you can turn a negative experience into a positive one.  I've never been to this store before and I won't be back.  I recently switched from at&t to sprint and have been very happy with sprint's service.  Corporate should really take a long look at this horrendous store and realize they are jepordizing their brand with stores like this one! I ended up going to best buy and was in and out in 15 minutes including activating my service.  Like I said I'm happy with sprint an will continue to support them its just a shame on how bad the retail store is!"
0,"Worst experience ever! For complaining about staff, supposed \""owner\"" kicked us out of his hotel. Family member told me owner said, \""NOW IT'S MY TURN TO TALK. Get out! ... If you don't leave now, I'll call security.\"" If you ever stay at this place never complain. We booked this place months in advance and on the day we arrive we immediately get booted. I know it's owners prerogative to refuse service, but this guy is in hospitality business. This is crossing the line! Exercise extreme caution what you say to management!"
1,"Just had dinner (sushi) and was not impressed. \nEvery roll lacked in size, flavor and presentation. (And it cost the same as those fancy sushi places) I was excited for the \""Rattlesnake\"" but it came to us \""doughy\"" and had absolutely no flavor.\nMy sons karate kid plate was delicious.. however $9 for a childs portion seems outrageous to me. \nThe family at the teptable was having a great time.. so the courses might be awesome, but I would not reccomend the sushi."
3,"Folk music fun times. This bar never seems to care how many people they let squeeze in and an impromptu ceilidh is always on the cards. A proper Edinburgh institution this place has incredible acts playing- watch out for anyone folky doing a gig at the nearby Liquid Rooms, there is no doubt that the after party will be here! \n\nUnfortunately Sandy Bells is one of the places that has suffered under the smoking ban. A thick fog of smoke helped to hide the sweaty scent which now dominates the room. Take my advice and get a few beers and ales in you- that way your sense of smell my lessen and you can really enjoy yourself!"
4,"My very very dear girlfriends wanted us to have the best experience in Vegas for my 40th, so they booked us a VIP suite at the Wynn.  I felt like royalty.  There's even VIP entrance, check-in and pools.  While we were checking in, they offered us water bottles and finger food (well, the latter is a lie haha).  Our room was beautiful and had a great view.  Even the bedding felt great and luxurious.  I didn't want to get off my bed.  The bathroom was about the size of my master bedroom at home.  The swimming pools were so beautiful and not crowded at all.  We didn't have to fight for chairs like other cheap places I've been to such as Hard Rock or MGM Grand.\nThe hotel itself is top notch.  We didn't even have to leave the hotel.  The night club, shopping, buffet, and restaurants were all in one place.  We only left for other amusements that weren't offered at the Wynn.  It's one of the best hotels I've stayed in."
4,"Great food, great price, great service. I went here with my husband & our 3 small children (5, 3 & 1) they were very attentive to not only us adults but also our children."
1,"This visit was my first to 'LL's can't say I want to return anytime soon.  The service was fair and the food was about the same.  This location was situated in the wild horse pass casino and hotel which was my first time visiting.\n\nMy friends took me and my brother here while my visit back home.  Can't say I enjoyed the restaurant very much and that maybe just because the waitress may have had a bad day or weekend but it also seemed qto be bad attitudes around the entire staff...  I have personally always liked eating at casino's, I know super strange but this visit was not ideal and not bad just no fire unfortunately for LL's.\n\nI ordered the evil jungle princess beef, when I noticed it on the menu I just couldn't resist.  I also order some soup which was nothing to rave about.  When my meal arrived the presentation for a $16 dollar plate was very poor.  I have payed for meals under $10 and gotten $30 presentations before but this was bad.  First bite was interesting and towards the middle to the end I just had enough.  I was hoping for more of what was described in the menu detail but the cook failed to sell me on it.\n\nIn the end LL's received stars based on performance and taste and I may be slightly more harsh on upper scale places but that's for a reason $.  My return to 'LL's may possibly happen again some day but not soon."
2,"I normally don't write reviews for chain food places, I don't really see the point. They wouldn't be a chain if it didn't appeal to a large number of people.\n\nThis place is basically Johnny Rockets without the milk shakes, but with tons of toppings available for free. Value, in terms of pricing, is excellent. The menu is simple and it shouldn't take too long to figure out what you want if its your first time.\n\nWhile you wait on your order you can work your way to the shelled peanuts which are self-serve and free. This is pretty cool I thought, and unlike Teakwoods, there aren't shells on the floor everywhere.\n\nThe toppings. Wow, tons of choices. I went with grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and jalapenos. The tomatoes and jalapenos were sliced too thick in my opinion, way too thick. However, the jalapenos were fresh, and not pickled. They were a little too spicy for me, but it was good. The lettuce wasn't so green, and to be quite honest I don't really remember seeing too much lettuce. Due to the sheer size of the toppings, it becomes a pain in stacking the burger and eating it.\n\nBEEF! I'm a little mixed on how to rate the burger patties. I felt that they were a tad bit too dry for my taste, but that the texture was very interesting, unique, and enjoyable. I hate to bring up Lobby's into this review, but if there is one thing Lobby's does well its their patties. I'm stuck in an awkward situation here. I liked their patties, but I've had better. I'll leave it at that.\n\nCajun fries. The cajun fries were awesome. Its exactly what it sounds like, fries seasoned with cajun seasoning. Delicious. I ordered a regular, and I must have got two supersized fries instead of one regular. I think it must have been a mistake, because the large brown bag that your order comes in (whether you do dine-in or take-out) was FULL of fries. I tried to finish them all with my 9 year old brother and we couldn't do it, there was just too much. To make the situation worse, we brought home a cup full of fries. This isn't a bad thing, just don't order too much fries or you'll have a ton leftover.\n\nThis place is over decorated. Its annoying. Every inch of space is filled with non-local reviews for this place. Are you kidding me? Can you let me decide by myself whether your food is good or not? Of course, this is America and if something is a fashion you have to adhere to the fashion if you wanna be American. But anyways, besides the loads of what amounts to self-praise, the rest of the wall is covered in red and white checkers. Also, there ar not booths, just tables and chairs, which can get a little cramped at times.\n\nFive Guys is a really good burger place, especially if you want a 'diner style' burger for a drive-thru price. You may or may not like the interior, but its a cool place to check out."
2,"Hosted the 2nd Breakfast Club UYE last sat and this time I picked BLD.\n\nEven though BLD did not take reservations they were able to seat us right away, which I was happy with! I liked the way the place is set up, its bright, cheerful and opened, liked the opened ceiling, my work has the same type, also liked that they are dog friendly and have patio seating for the dog lovers, and they even have a drive thru so you can order food and go. Like the overall vibe BLD has. Our server was Tara, and she was super! Always making sure our table had everything we needed and seeing how we were doing. Love good service! \n\n I picked BLD because I heard they had eggs benedicts and I have been craving hollandaise sauce forever! I ordered the Cali Benedicts, came with bacon, tomato & avocado, poached eggs on top of a English muffin covered in hollandaise sauce with a side of breakfast potatoes. The plate looked beautiful, bright yellows, greens and reds; I like color so this pleased my eyes. The only thing that was a bummer was it was lacking in flavor, everything was bland, the hollandaise sauce was creamy, but no tangy taste too it, and that's the part I had been craving.  So I wasn't blown away with the flavor of the food, but I was happy with checking out BLD."
3,"Great location, just a block from the strip.  I like that this is a more laid back hotel.  Love the beds and the room was clean and did not break the bank"
2,"This is a nice PT's. It's got a long bar with TVs and gaming. Bartenders are generally attentive enough. Seating it somewhat limited though as the removed their dining area to make room for two billiard tables. So there's some big chairs and small tables in the bar area, along with a couple of small booths. But that's about it. There is a party room. And there's also some seating outside on the patio when the weather is nice. This is definitely one of the larger PT's locations. The servers are total hit or miss. Sometimes their great and totally attentive. Other times, you have to flag them down every time and there's lots of errors. This is probably my fav PT's to eat at. I love their Southwestern BLT and sweet potato fries. Hint: Get a side of honey mustard to dip the fries in. Overall, this is my 2nd fav PT's around town."
3,"Checked around to see what sports bar had the Big 10 Network, and Connely's the only one anywhere near in N Phoenix. Looked a bit like a biker bar out front with numerous parked bikes and kind of dark inside, but lot's of TVs and low light made for good viewing. Expected country music but it was more alternative, pretty loud, but excellent selection in my opinion. Seemed like a pretty diverse crowd on a late Sunday afternoon. The service was very friendly and prompt. Not a great beer selection, but did have some craft brews on tap along with a number of Irish brews. The burgers we had were excellent and so were the sweet potato fries we had as a side. I highly recommend them. I guess you could call this an Irish pub Sports bar, but pretty hard to label. A lot of TVs and very willing to put on what you want, good food and friendly service, so no labels required."
4,"I came here early this AM slightly panicked about a bizarre and excruciating foot pain instead of going to a hospital urgent care center and was pleasantly surprised\n\nWait time was non-existent first thing in the morning and diagnostic quick and efficient. Greg was very nice, but more importantly very knowledgeable and able to explain my injury in a way I could easily understand.\n\nI highly highly recommend this clinic as a great alternative. I will definitely be returning the next time I need general primary care. A++."
0,"I moved to NW LV 6 months ago and often bike 20+ miles to the strip for some poker and gaming fun. I recently arrived at the Quad to meet a friend passing through town. Upon arriving I had to lock up my bike so I asked valet if they had a bike rack. The attendant replied with uncertainty and told me \""no\"", then said \""maybe in the back\"" and then \""no\"" again. I asked the attendant specifically if there would be a problem if I locked my bike up to a post or railing somewhere. The attendant didn't know or didn't think it would be a problem. I was very sure to show the attendant my concern for locking my bike to an undesignated post but it felt okay to do so according to the response. I proceed through the valet and into the parking garage to first look for a designated bike rack or bike area. After climbing several floors I came across nothing to be designated and proceeded to look for a railing. I came across an old and obviously unused stairway and locked up my bike using a Kryptonite lock and cable to the side of the staircase. I positioned my bicycle in a very thoughtful manner to make sure my handlebars or any extremity were in no way going to block the access of the staircase. I met a friend, we joined a poker tournament and I left roughly 2 hours later. My bike was gone. No evidence of anything was left behind. Immediately it felt like a security issue vs a theft issue. It takes a lot of work to break a Kryptonite U-Lock. I was outraged but I kept my cool and expressed my disgust professionally. \nValet called up security and immediately security became sarcastic and admitted they cut my lock and took my bike because it was illegally locked to a stairway. I then quickly began to explain how I spoke with valet about the bike rack situation and how there was no concern with locking my bike to a post or railing somewhere. Of course they didn't care and had very foolish reasons why they did what they did.  They told me that I should have asked security where to park my bike and not valet, but who would ever think to ask security? Valet seems like the more obvious to me. The security continued to tell me that if I would have asked them, they would have directed me towards the Bell desk and Bell would have taken care of it for me. Who would have thought Bell will take care of your bikes for you? And why aren't the valet trained to tell you that? \n\nI demand an apology and a $25 check to cover the cost of my lock. I will not let this go until I get what I deserve but either way this casino and Caesars Management in general have lost all my respect."
4,Hours 9:30 to 6:00 everyday closed sat.....now has OPI gel and polish
0,"Someone actually gave this place five stars? Kill yourself.\n\nI'd rather eat the dead raccoon from hot tub time machine than subject myself to another shitty piece of sushi from Sumo Sushi.\n\nI'm grouping this in the same league as Inaka (Blue Diamond/Cimarron), and Inaka gave me food poisoning. I literally almost didn't make it home before I shit all over the place, and that goes for the 3 friends that were also subjected to Sumo's horror.\n\nI liked the ambiance of the place, but I can't imagine why ANYONE would EVER eat here when Naked Fish / Sen of Japan are 5 minutes down the road.\n\nMy asshole hurts just thinking about Sumo."
0,"Went into this particular branch for the first time, mostly because of the convenience, being located near the on/off ramps to the Loop 101. Initially found the atmosphere pleasant due to overall cleanliness and presentation but, then I decided to interact with the employees there. The teller that helped me came off as rude, abrasive and ignorant of the idea that their job is to relay a good customer service experience while helping me with my request.  Needless to say I won't be coming back here anytime soon and was happy when my business had concluded, left more annoyed than anything else."
1,Fat Heads has really great burgers but I have one issue. I don't like french fries but nearly every sandwich comes with them. I kindly asked if I could replace my french fries with something else and they told me no. I really find it hard to believe that inflexible restaurants still exist in this day and age.
1,Walked in to the salon around 6:40p when the door clearly says they close at 7pm. The lady was cleaning up and said she she was closed already. \n\nI don't think you should advertise you're open until 7p and tell a customer you're closed 20 minutes before. Bad first impression.
4,"Okay, I have some explaining to do. My best friend and I are going to an EVENT this weekend to celebrate her birthday. She came up with the awesome idea of getting all crazy and wearing wigs. .....I thought \""FUN\"" and wholeheartedly  agreed !!! ........Now she wants me to keep this wig thing a secret so strictly poker face here. \n\nAfter reviewing Yelp, I told her I had the perfect place to find some cool wigs. I drove us around the block three times, literally . With this little 1970's wig boutique being on Central Ave , it's not exactly easy to access. \n\nFinally, I found a  small  alley and pulled in the back. (please see the picture). I knocked on the door with the microscopic signage that says \""Wigs\"" and out popped a tiny Asian woman who whisked us inside.\n\nWe walked into wig heaven. Every length , every color. I couldn't stop laughing. Rows and rows of wigs. \n\nI was a little startled at how the owner was so protective of her wigs. She made us sit down and only one person at a time could try one on. She  said \"" Are you going to buy a wig today\""? I smiled and said NO..........we are going to buy TWO !!!\n\nAlthough the parking was atrocious ( one star), the service was abrubt and  rushed ( two stars), we ultimately found our perfect wigs for the reasonable price of $35 each the best part,  I'm still cracking up!!! (that's worth five stars in of itself!) Overall, I would rate this shopping experience a  solid five ! \n\nHave a great weekend ! \n\nGaga..........Oh-la-la"
0,Really can't even give them a 1.. A few good nurses understaffed!!! Meds denied by pharmacy and never given on time not to mention some nurses rude and unprofessional!!! Unfortunately only hospital my mother's doctor contracted out of!!!!
2,Well stocked but found it very pricey. My son has his eye on a tin of bacon flavoured Jelly beans which were \u00a37.50. Too expensive for all it was. plenty of different items in here but not appealing enough to make a purchase.
2,"Sacks undoubtedly has some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix, but that being said, their sandwiches are really just okay. When I go here, I usually order the egg salad sandwich which is good except it is easy to tell that the bacon was made far in advance as it is always super salty. Easily my favorite part about going to sacks is the little cookie you get with your order as it's really tasty and never large enough!"
3,"Great place to study. There are plenty of seats in the cafe, the outlet situation seems to be adequate. The barista's are very nice! Great setting, quite atmosphere. The bookstore is quiet doesn't seem to be too crazy busy like B&N and the pricing is a smidge lower, but if you sign up for their great discount card plan you get a 10% discount! and free shipping on online orders! how awesome is that?"
0,The problem with this dry cleaner is poor counter service.  I have never been treated in such a poor manner - and the sad part is that this SERVICE provider doesn't care.  I recommend going elsewhere.  They are not worth my money.
4,"I love coming here. When ever my wife says we are going to yard house I get so happy. I love all the beers on tap, and the sampler which rotates every Tuesday is a nice starting point. I get the same feeling of getting to go to chuck e cheese as a kid when I go here. \n\nI love yard house."
0,"I gave a 1 because i can't give a zero.\n\nI trusted Joel and Art's Automotive for years.  However, I had not been there for a few years.  I took my 1999 Passat in there because the battery kept going fead and Ifigured something was putting a drain on it.  Joel told me I needed a new alternaor and it would be over $800 and only then could they tell what else was wrong with it.  I talked to an independent mechanic and he told me worst case scenario for a new alternator would be $330.  I called Joel and ask how much to get the car charged and drive it home. He said  I owed them $ 185 for the tow and diagnostic.  i said the diagnostic only told me that the alternator was bad and Auto Zone would have told me that for nothing.  I paid the $ 185 and drove the car home.  The independent mechanic came and looked at it and said there was nothing wrong with the alternator or battery and I owed him nothing.  A savings of over $ 800.  And by the way Joel offered me $500 for the car and said it would blue book at about $2000 in good shape.  The fact is the car blue book value is about $4200.  The car is in excellent conditon and runs just fine.  Leather seats, moon roof, and all the extras.\n\nI feel like I was being scammed and will never go to Art's again even for an oil change.  It saddens me to think I could trust them only to find out Joel was trying to scam me!!!!\n\nMy mecahanic has now fixed several of my friends cars and they are all very happy.  Thank God there are some honest people left in the auto repair business but Art's Automotive is certainly not one of them!!!"
4,"Every time I've been to Park Bruges I have been astounded.  Nothing I have ever had there has been bad.  My recommendation first and foremost is to try their frites - you will not be disappointed.  It comes with a garlic mayonnaise which will knock your socks off.  I have been there for both brunch and dinner, and it is wonderful for both.  The wait staff is great and very efficient.  Their cocktail list also features some delicious choices that go very well with your meal."
2,"This place is ok. Good and fast service, but the rolls are nothing to write home about. In fact, most of them are tempura shrimp based so there is not much true variety if you think about it. The tempura banana desert is really good, so if you find yourself eating here, make sure you get it."
3,Wonderful gyro! This is the first one i've had outside of Chicago and I absolutely adored it. The sauce is fabulous and I could actually taste the dill. It was just enough and I wasn't stuffed. I will be a repeat customer.
4,"Got pedicure and has appointment set. Mye did my pedi and she was punctual, personable and did a very thorough job. Michael, the owner is very friendly and really cares about his salon and customer care. They are moderately priced, but I feel it was worth it. The salon is very nice and roomy. I would recommend it."
0,"This place is in dire need of a make over. I walked in and the smell reminding me of my grandmothers apartment. So did the decor. So far the place looks old and smells old. The service was great, and then the food starting coming. The chicken dry, the turkey wrapped in bacon was dry, the sausage was okay, then they brought old tri tip. We could not eat it. As they were cutting it, it looked grey, the taste was bad! \nI would never go back there and any reviews on here that say this place is amazing must be from the owners family. Save your money! Buy one Get one is a waste of your money. Nice people but they are not serving fresh food."
2,"I absolutely loved my first visit to this restaurant. So much, in fact, that we decided to take some family here over the holidays. Our service on this visit....sucked. And that's being nice. I asked our waitress if she was new, but she said she had been there over a month. After asking on 5 separate occasions for water, we finally flagged down another waiter and asked him. I do love the ambience...but will the \""lodgey\"" feel be appropriate when it's 110 degrees outside? The food is good, but pricey."
3,"You know what they say.... location, location, location.  It's on the corner of an intersection within the strip mall so parking is hell and it's right next to the UPS store so that doesn't help either.  However, that's the only bad things.\n\nDo wish they had a drive-thru.\n\nThe younger girls that work there are usually bored but that's to be expected for a job like that.  They are attentive though and the clothes always comes back clean from their central warehouse area where they actually do the dry cleaning.  What's neat is that all your preferences, and information is stored from any Al Phillips so you don't have to tell them how you like your clothes done.  Realized this when the gal gave me a ticket after asking for my number.\n\nAnother neat thing is that they do have a mobile service.  Costs more but might need it at some point.  \n\nEight pieces cost about $38, which comes to a little under $5 a piece.  A little pricier than I've paid in other cities but as long as it's clean, and on-time, it's worth it."
3,"This place is always packed like its menu. \n\nDefinitely a hang out for the cafe-nistas !\n\nNicely situated in the heart of Boca Park. Nestled among other stores such as kona grill, cheesecake, gordon birsch, total wine, target and the list goes on.\nAfter a cup of coffee, take a second and take what vegas away from the strip has to offer."
2,"Essence was an impulse stop for me as I was driving on University. I decided  to stop in after reading \""bakery and cafe\"" from their sign. As I pulled in, I noticed the line through the window of the tiny restaurant. I walked in and had to squish my way to the back of the line through people sitting at tables and people already in line. The restaurant is tiny but they do have a  patio for additional seating. Line moved pretty quickly but noticed their bakery display was pretty limited. This made me sad because I was excited to see all the goodies that a bakery would have offered. \n\nI went to order and asked the cashier her recommendations since this was my first time visiting. She recommended the salad (only a few to choose from) and the grilled cheese with tomato, mozzarella and basil sandwich. I went with the sandwich and was given the choice of mixed greens or potato salad. I chose mixed greens. I also decided to order a vanilla bean macaroon because I wanted to try a bakery item. Total (without drink) was over $11, so not super cheap. Drinks were expensive, even a can of soda was $1.25. \n\nI took the order to go and waited about 10 minutes for my food. When I got home, I was disappointed to see the mixed greens were literally big pieces of lettuce with a vinagrette rather than an actual salad with veggies. The sandwich was OK, the bread was really good. The macaroon was good, soft outside and gooey buttercream frosting inside. I didn't eat it all at once because I found the texture somewhat unappealing and a little too rich. \n\nI think I would come back for breakfast (I hear it's better) rather than during the busy lunch rush."
0,Room temperature water in stinky glasses should have been the sign ... No bread delivered or offered ... Caesar salad was average at best ... Nobody asked how the meal was ... Assistant waiter came over and took my salad before I finished it!!! He put a bread plate on top of it (don't know why I had a bread plate) so there was no taking it back ... Staff does not care and I won't be back.
1,"I was fairly disappointed. The burger was mediocre, maybe a little thicker than a typical burger at a Wendy's, and I asked for a little ketchup and mustard on mine and it was absolutely slobbered in it... At least they were being generous instead of skimpy, right? Pricing was pretty poor too- I got a burger fries and a soda and it worked out to over $14; keeping in mind this is a fast food burger place. I won't be going back, unfortunately."
4,"This place is so unassuming and in a shopping center so you may never really put it on your list of places to go - but you SHOULD. The food is EXCEPTIONAL. The service is always wonderful. This is one of the places that could make it in a high traffic area/snooty location because of the food alone, but it's nice they are a neighborhood favorite. Seriously get the margarita pizza and the fettucini."
3,"We always somehow make our way here when we come to Vegas. This place is always packed, for good reason. The food is great and the service is fast. Big bonus points for being open 24 hours. Need one of these in Seattle!"
0,"Very poor service and timing I noticed three managers on the floor and yet drinks where empy and tables went without being greeted. I orderd a salad as my meal and received it twelve minutes nefore the rest of my parties meal.\nThe menu notes fresh ingredients however a precooked most likley frozen chicken product comes on both the salads and pizza. The pizza was good way better then the service. Our server Sara who screwed up the tables order right next to ours (forgot to ring in their pizza) and seemed disinterested In everything and confused by, well everything.\nOur party of four did not expect exceptional service or food when we entered we just wanted a decent lunch.  We left full but disgusted by the lack of training and manager interaction and engagement with the staff and guests. Please address theese issues . I feel your product is good but without better training and guest focus you are a lost cause"
0,"Just tried this place on a whim tonight, and ordered a 14 inch basic cheese pizza.  I have to say, was not impressed at all.  It was a very thin crust, which had no flavor, and was just overall very very blah.  And for the $14 and some price tag, I was expecting something with a bit more taste to it.  Won't be going back here."
4,"So what's to say about this place, besides that it's Amazing?\n\nEntering you don't feel like you are in an Tempe coffee shop. They have this amazing 70's swing over retro lamp, and cool Victorian style sitting chairs. I really like the vibe of this place, although last time it sounded like I was hearing that horrible Staind band in the the background. Thank gawd for ipods! The bathroom was clean and Baristas always greet you and thank you when leaving. \n\nIf this gives you any kind of sense of how cool this place is, last few times on the dvd player was The Incredibles, Life Aquatic and Sideways!\n\nEvery time I have been there I order  the Acai and Strawberry smoothie and it has this great smooth taste that isn't overwhelming sweet like most other smoothies!\n\nThis is a great place to draw, or to grab coffee with friends after dinner!"
1,"Dr Ron is the best. The staff is not. They \""the staff\""actually wanted me to get my dog vaccinated while she was bleeding from her vagina.... Dr.Ron said if I would of listened to the front counter staff and had her vaccinated that she would of probably died from the shots!!!\nThat was the story with my Rottie.\nT\nhen months before that my Labrador grew an infection absess over night and the female doctor said it was a tumor. Well tumors do not grow overnight. She tried to milk me for hundreds of dolars in testes and gave us meds that did not work.\n\nI took her back to see DR.Ron and he prescribed meds that worked!!! Dr. Ron is good!\n\nI am not a vet but I knew the overnight absess was not a tumor. How can the female doctor determine that while knowing the facts that I gave her. I only trust Dr Ron.\n\nNow my Rottie has blood in her urine and all I need to do is bring in a urine sample.\nI make $10.00 per hour and cannot afford to be milked with uneeded visits or tests.\n\nIn the meanwhile they refuse to let me speak with the Dr for even one minute? No returned call? Do they even relay the messages any longer???\n\nThe staff is unprofessional but used to be much better and caring. Now it seems to be all about money!!!! A lady named Hannah at the front desk and her co workers seemed to be trained to take money for extra B.S that is ot needed."
1,"Great facility, awful service. This is truly a cliquish place, it seems you have to know someone to get someone to talk to you.  I have shopped there several times and the few floor walkers there are engaged in conversations with each other. I have asked for help and was treated like an interruption.  With some proper management and staff this place could be something special."
4,"Sooo....have you ever been given a tablet pc as a wine list at a restaurant?  I have not.  So freakin' cool.  Normally you're given the generic binder type thing and depending on the thickness of it immediately form an opinion of what their wine selection must be.  Well....wow...you're given the tablet and told, \""Ok miss (or whatever), you can choose a wine by type, label, region, vintage, appellation, etc\"" so of course, I'm immediately overwhelmed.  I ask for the sommelier and because I'm treating (long story-it's Vegas), I ask for the last wine of the year acc. to Mr. Parker. (that's right...big spender-natch--ha!)  Boom!  There it is on the tablet pc/wine list thingie.  Funny (or curiously) enough, my friends had not heard of the famous wine tower with the famous wine angels, so I ask if he can tell us when they're getting our wine for us so we can watch our corresponding wine angel, so (very \""mission impossible-y\"") he presses a forefinger to his ear and says, \""Uh, Angela?  You got the brunello?  Great. Yeah, can you turn around and wave please?\"" She does.  How cool is that???  How many places can they do that in?  Not many.  Only at Aureole.  Only in Vegas, where Cirque de Soleil is the new Barnum & Bailey. Not only that, but the food is fabulous.  GREAT experience."
1,"Ordered a triple latte and expected to receive a 20 oz. drink, which is what the huge sign above counter said.  But what I received was obviously much smaller. So I pointed it out and asked them to correct it.  I was given a larger cup and went home to enjoy my coffee.  But it still looked way too small. So I measured it out and turns out they had put it in a 16 oz. cup.  I went back, measuring cup in hand, and they tried to blame it on the cash register and then the owner, (all the while the manager is telling me how nice she had been to me earlier.)  Needless to say she was quite rude and simply told the barista to give me a medium to make up for the difference-he by the way was very nice and I felt badly for how she spoke to him.  \n   I work for at s high-end hotel and know all about how to give good service and get repeat customers.  And although the coffee was great I won't be in any rush to go there again."
4,Great family owned business. Very responsive quick service. They are the only ones in Arizona for classic auto glass. They also have the cleanest shop I have ever seen. Keep up the great work.
0,Stopped by half an hour before closing time by myself (not a big group or anything). Was turned away because supposedly the cook has left already.
3,"Butters is close to my office so I must say in this review I'm a bit biased because they are so convenient for lunch and always get my to go order ready really quickly. My constants are either the cobb salad with honey mustard or the California chicken club with French fries. I'm unhealthily addicted to the French fries and would put the honey mustard dressing on absolutely anything I would eat ever. It's home made and delicious. Now the reason this is only a 4 star is your pricing. $3.45 for 3 scrawny pieces of bacon that are as thin as 2 pencils put next to each other? really? And over $5.00 for an Orange Juice? I know it's Scottsdale but re-visit that pricing structure Butters! Either way, my wallet may eternally be unhappy with me, but I will continue to be loyal because of the convenience and the consistency of deliciousness."
4,"This is the first place I've been whose food was so good it promoted me to write a Yelp review. Guess I'm a Yelper now.. Their entire place is gluten free and their staff has clearly been trained at a high level. I worked in the restaurant industry for 3.5 years at an upper echelon restaurant, let me be the first to say: Jewel's food is amazing. The decor is fresh and relaxing. My only complain is that there aren't more people filling the tables that all have fresh flowers and all unique chairs. Six stars if I could. My gluten sensitivity needs have been met."
0,"While the shoe quality is excellent, their ordering practice is extremely poor.\nTwo pair of shoes were ordered on 12/30/13.  \nThree calls were placed after assurance of delivery on 1/3/14.  I was told bad weather, death, very busy time of year, lack of help....\nI was told the order was not placed until 1/6/14 on 1/14/14.  \nPlenty of opportunity was given for this company to fess up and simply state they were incapable of processing the order in a timely manner.  \nI was offered a refund.  Another irritating factor,   Foot Solutions processed the credit card immediately on 12/30/14.   Unfortunate they were not as speedy on delivery."
3,"Went there with colleague ... and we loved it! But, we did have to wait 45 minutes on a Thursday night ... reservations are definitely an advantage and highly recommended (along with the WIG SHOP next door)! \n\nHighlights were ... First and foremost ... definitely the FABULOUS wine list (if you like Riesling, you'll LOVE this selection ... and WHAT would better calm your fiery taste buds after some chili paste???) ... the Tom Yum Kai soup is delish (but you'd better enjoy some spicy, tingling lips afterward)... and the sea bass special that was sprinkled with fresh basil, mint and chili oil. OMFG ... YUM! The NUA DAD DEAW ( Beef jerky Issan style) ap had great flavor ... but definitely traditional JERKY STYLE (dry and hard to chew). I've had better Thai-style jerky that was thicker, crispy on the outside, but very tender on the inside. The NAM KAO TOD (crispy rice) was very unique and I would highly recommend. \n\nThis place is definitely worth the trip."
1,"I have visited Barrios twice. The first time I met my friend for happy hour. Happy hour is OK nothing spectacular. 2 different wines $4 a glass, domestic beer 3, and house margaritas 4. The first visit I had a glass of wine and ordered one of the happy hour appetizers. The chips and salsa were very good. But when I got the appetizers I could not believe how small the portion was. I was not expecting anything huge but it would have been nice if it filled me up. I ordered ceviche and it was expensive and not great.\n\nVisit number 2 was disappointing. The waitress was cranky and did not keep our drinks or salsa filled. I had a happy hour margarita and it tasted like there was NO alcohol in it at all. We had to flag the waitress down just to get another beer, really. I once again ordered an appetizer from the happy hour menu and there was a problem with it so I sent it back and had it removed from my bill. \n\nAll in all for the price I am not satisfied. Each time the bill was $50 and the food nor the drinks were that great. Darn, it is so close to my house to."
3,"Nice spot that I ran into by accident trying to get a car wash. \nThey were super quick... And did a really good job of washing the \ncar. The prices are right and its nice and intimate in this location. \nThe interior as you wait is very simple and has the potential to be \nuncomfortable if the day is busy. Its very small with maybe a total of \n5 or so seats. \nI will def be back, its close to home and they do a great job, what\nmore can a girl ask for."
4,"My new go-to spot in Arcadia. Pat (the owner) is almost always there to greet customers and make sure you have an excellent experience. The back patio is a great place to relax, go check it out before it gets too hot. Wifi, great espresso (the barista use to work at Stumptown in Oregon), nice staff, good food. Recommended to all, let's help this place succeed."
3,Nice local place with some interesting rolls you won't get at other places! My favorite was the tiger roll. We also liked their gyoza and tofu appetizer. Great service.. We plan on coming back!
2,"I tried Wicked Spoon Buffet for lunch on a Friday, and I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a long line to get in.  We had the choice of complimentary first round of mimosas (DELISH), champagne, and bloody mary (I believe).  Mimosas were so good, I was wishing it was unlimited!  \n\nThe atmosphere is really nice and we were seated near the dessert area.  I was slightly overwhelmed by the food options and everything I wanted was served in these metal bowls that took up lots of space on my plate so I kept going back for rounds.  My favorite dish was the Angry Mac and Cheese (I think that is what it's called).  It was cheesy with a nice kick to it.  The Tri-tip was next on my list of favorites.  The dessert options were not as exciting as I have seen at other buffets, but the gelato was absolutely amazing.  \n\nOverall, presentation of the food was very nice, but I felt like the food options were okay.  I was hoping for some seafood and meat variety and more exciting desserts like made to order crepes, fondue fountain, etc. like I have seen at other buffets."
4,I make an effort to come here every time I'm in town.  It is so worth it the HH menu has really good portions of food for the price.  I recommend the calamari and the sushi rolls.
4,"Great place to stay!  Friendly, helpful staff makes this place very comfortable.  Great cont. breakfast.  Pool, hot tub area is a great place to get \""all over\"" sun!!!  I will be back again soon!!!"
2,"\""Due Forni Pizza and Wine\"" has unique pizzas and a variety of wines on its menu. It has attentive serving staff and comfortable ambience (in a weekday afternoon anyway). Its bar appears quite inviting. The enclosed patio with very large windows is nice, though facing only the relatively quiet parking lot by S. Town Center Dr. The menu is the same for both lunch and dinner; its prices a bit high for lunch, especially the wines, but OK for dinner.\n\nIt offers two kinds of crust for pizzas. My wife and I tried the thin/crispy type with speck. It had a rugged presentation, but its PROSCIUTTO and crust were delicious in every bite. The Caeser's salad was also excellent. Our glasses of red wine ($12.95/glass) were excellent but a bit too pricey [Wine prices vary from $8-$15/glass for average wines, and $20-$50/glass for the more exotic].\n\nWe were there in a late weekday afternoon, thus, only a few tables of guests there. Our attentive, friendly server told us that the restaurant got busy usually after 6pm.\n- No, Due Forni does not offer special \""Happy Hour\"", but does offer $5/glass of selected wines from 5-7pm, as well as \""Wine Sampling\"" at 20%discount per glass.\n\nWe finished our meals before 6:30pm that evening, so we did NOT see any \""Happy Hour Type\"" of crowd typically swarming at popular Roy's, Kona Grill, or Gordon Biersch around 3-7pm. The manager came over to ask us, quite sincerely, how we enjoyed our dinner - a very nice touch. We liked that. Yes, we plan to give Due Forni another try some weekends, when there will be a larger crowd.\n\nIn Short:\n- If you like good pizzas, nice but slightly more expensive wines, and QUIETER ambience, say, for a late lunch/early dinner, then Due Forni is worth a try. But, if you prefer a more exciting (happily noisier) atmosphere of the happy hour with good food/drinks, then there are other better places than Due Forni.\n\nPeterskis, Mar 2012"
4,Place is delecious!  I keep getting the Beach house and I really want to try something new.  Brett says the Taco's are his favorite thing on the menu.  It's just hard to try something new when the first thing you try is so dang good!  Milkshakes are insane..must try..\n\nKeep going back its well worth it every time!
1,"My friends and I went to this wine bar expecting to find a nice selection of wine and a knowledgeable staff. Instead, we had a waitress that couldnt even tell us where the wine came from and had such a limited experience she couldn't  recommend a wine for us to drink. The flights they offered were boring and over priced. I will defiantly not be going back."
2,"You want a monster sandwich that will challenge the hunger of even the burliest man? Go order a Dagwood from Gandolfo's deli. It's roast beef, turkey, ham, pastrami, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mayo, spicy mustard, salt and pepper, as close to nirvana as I'm ever getting. (In case you couldn't tell by the ingredients, I was a little indecisive about what kind of sandwich I wanted, so I just took the works.)\n\nDuring lunch it can get a little hairy in Gandolfo's deli, and I'm not talking about the number of people there (which is many) but the ratio of males to females (which is very high, me being the only customer lacking a y chromosome). There is a reason why this is so. These sandwiches are monstrous meat and cheese concoctions slathered in sauce and served big. I could easily make a phallic reference about all these men consuming massive hoagies, but I'm going to take the high road this review.\n\nI was considering the hard salami smothered in sauce, but I didn't know if it would be filling enough...\n\nOkay. So the low road suits me better. \n\nI opted for the $2.49 meal deal to complement my Dagwood, which left me with a gigantic sandwich, a quarter pound of potato salad, and a regular iced tea with plenty left over for dinner that night. It was close to ten bucks after tax, which is a little bit on the pricey side, but at least I made two meals of it. \n\nThe potato salad was decent but lacked salt, like they didn't bother boiling the potatoes with this necessary ingredient. I love me some salt. Get me a lick and I'll take a cheese grater to it to season my meals. Or make me a salt flavored ring pop for those mid day cravings. My blood pressure will curse you, but I'll be singing your praises. After adding this magic ingredient Gandolfo's potato salad got pretty good, and they get extra credit for using red potatoes, leaving the skin on, and preparing it with vinaigrette and mayo instead of mustard. Yum!\n\nIt's pretty decent for a sandwich shop and the menu is intimidating in size and offerings. You could do much worse *coughBlimpie'scough*, so give it a whirl if you find yourself in the area."
1,"I loved Dr. Le and thought she provided excellent care for me and my kids, and went here because of the great Yelp reviews, but the office staff are ridiculous. Very unprofessional and unhelpful. It took 4 business days and being on hold for unacceptable lengths of time just to get a prescription for my contacts printed out and signed. When I went to pick it up at their office, both office staff acted incompetently and were unfriendly. This was a simple request that should have been handled quickly and efficiently, but these 2 girls are apparently unable to provide that kind of care. One of them was also dressed very inappropriately for the office. The doctors need to hire new staff in order for me to return there, which I'm very sad to say because I really liked the doctor!"
1,"The bad: 20% of our dinners were not prepared correctly, then had to wait for a third try before they came out in mediocre state, had much higher expectations for a steakhouse. The other dinners were 5-star quality.\n\nService was also 5-star until the main courses arrived, then they all disappeared not too be seen at the table for way too long."
1,"Went tonight for my very first experience of a PF Changs...not impressed at all.\nI was taken by 2 people who have been a number of times in Florida...apparently it is quite different there than here.\n\nWhere to start...decor, restaurant out of a box....I've seen these exact same faux-stone walls and columns in various restaurants around N. America and the islands...give me break. The lighting is terribly bright, I felt like I was in a cafeteria...get some different bulbs please.\n\nFood...egg-rolls...absolutely tasteless...the only flavour came from the dipping-sauce...honey-mustard..really? \nChicken in lettuce wraps...pretty bland and gimmicky, was not impressed and would not recommend.\n\nMain courses...mongolian beef and the sesame chicken were both good, not great but definitely worth the money and worth having.\nSpiceyShrimp and noodles...so overloaded with salt it was un-edible! and I'm pretty salt-tolerant!!...kudos...they did not charge us for it.\n\nService was friendly,efficient and fast.\n\nDrinks...1 vodka-tonic,1mojito and 1 Tsing-tao beer\nno coffee, no desserts.\n\nCost $87. including taxes but before the tip.\n\nMy 2 friends told me the food was far better presented and much tastier at the US  PF Changs in Florida that they go to and that the decor was more upscale there also...all of which is kind of counter-intuitive in a way.\n\nAll said and done I found the $87 price for what we got to be acceptable...you get what you pay for.\n\nI would not bother going back...the food,location and ambience just aren't worth my time or effort. If you want Chinese food there are plenty of places in Montreal with much,much better food."
1,"I will start out by saying, this place has good food.  I ordered the Rising Sun Kobe burger. It was totally awesome and worth 16 bucks.\n\n\""Why the shitty 2 star review Kate?\"" You ask.  I will splain it to you...\n\nSo its about 4pm on a Monday. The place is not packed.  Its our last meal in Vegas before we drive back home. We walk up the the hostess, tell her party of 2.  She asked us if we wanted to be at the bar or in the restaurant.  I tell her restaurant.  She says the wait till be 20 minutes.  I then say, if the bar has regular tables, then we can swing that. She says yes, and then takes us to a coffee table.  I dont want to eat a burger at a goddamn coffee table. So we move to the bar. Hmmm. Ok... \n\nBartender/waitress-  Shes a case.  I ordered a diet coke. She says \""really?\""  yes bitch really. She then also proceeded to criticize my fiance's order. \""Thats really small you know. are you sure thats what you want?\""  She also complains about her co workers not getting her??? wtf . At some point she tells this couple next to us, that shes young but knows her drinks?? As if they give a shit.  The whole time shes just talking to us sarcastically and then at some point im quite positive that shes hitting on my dude.  \n\nI can appreciate that they want the staff to be cool/tattooed/young but these people lack any basic customer service skills.  I will assume they will get many complaints before they figure out how to staff this place properly.  \n\nIf you can deal with these morons, then eat here.  The food is for sure really good.  maybe you will have better luck than we did."
2,"This is a St. Patty's day review.\n\nThey blocked off the parking lot. For some reason drinks were a tiny bit cheaper outside. Guinness was $5.75 inside & only $5 outside. Strange.\n\nThere was some band doing all sorts of cover songs. The song choices were great, but the band sucked! There was more live music inside which was a little more Irish authentic.\n\nThe people working here are hot. That's the guys, & girls. Yowza!\n\nOnly shitty thing about this place is if you try to order a soda or water you will get ignored. You're gonna have to ask 3-5 times before you get your non-alcoholic drink. Yes, I KNOW they make $$ off alcohol, but c'mon now... It takes 5 seconds to pour a soda.\n\nThe bathrooms became disgusting. That's too be expected & I'm not docking points for that. There are only 2 stalls though. Ladies, pee faster!\n\nAll in all this place isn't too bad. Decently pub like. I ended my night at Rosie's though & I think I'll skip Finnegans next year & go strait to Rosies."
0,"If I could re-do that day that we went here, I would.  I would opt NOT to go here and waste $12 per person (champagne brunch on a Sunday).  It's a buffet and there didn't seem to be much of a choice.  I suppose what I mean by that is that nothing really appealed to me.  I ended up just sticking to breakfast type food because those were the most edible items there.  The fried chicken was also slightly good.  I scored a drumstick and it was perfect.  However, when I got a bigger piece of fried chicken, the batter was on point but it was dry on the inside.  I guess the smaller pieces are juicier.  I didn't even bother to eat dessert because my stomach seemed upset after 1 and 1/2 plates.  In retrospect, we should have just gone back to Aloha Specialties at California hotel & casino."
0,"Two words: Chile relleno. \n\nThree more words: With the seeds?! \n\nThe order is small (which I don't mind) and so is the price... I figured that matched up and it was, overall, a tasty dish. But they don't clean the chiles? I have had this before when I noticed that, I figured it was an honest mistake. As I am only here about 4-6 times a year, I figured the last time had to be an anomaly. \n\nIt has the potential to be a 3 or 4 star place for what they portray themselves to be: quick mexican food (as opposed to fast food a la Taco Bell or Del Taco), decent flavors, and good prices. I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.\n\nHowever, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds. It made the dish bitter and inedible where it was present. \n\nAdd to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?) and they forgot her side of beans.\n\nHistory was already \""meh,\"" and now #lunchfail. Potential just doesn't cut it."
2,"Went here on a Friday night, booking thru opentable.com and it showed only one time available. But when we were seated at our 6:45 reservation time, there were many tables that were empty. \nI was a little disappointed by this place. It was hyped up so much (Rachel Ray, reviews, friends) and I guess I was expecting a lot more. The decor was sub-par as others have mentioned. It's located in a strip mall on Sahara, but even with the location, I was expecting something with more ambiance and character especially since the food was so amazing and not cheap. I can't complain about any of the food we got, it was all delicious and the customer service was fantastic."
3,"Me Lyng is the last, great remnant of the old 8th Ave. Gone are Chiodo's Mystery Meat sandwich and the legendary Dawn's Donuts. Me Lyng has been a staple in Homestead for as long as I can remember.\n\nI highly recommend the Vietnamese dishes over the Chinese ones. I normally order the pho xao, which always turns heads. If you're not a fan of onions, you can get this dish without them, which I suggest doing.\n\nI love the ambiance of the place. The new facade allows for great natural lighting during the daytime and I recommend their lunch specials (they're cheap and good). The decor is nothing fancy but there's something about this place that is very warm and inviting.\n\nSadly, the past few times I've been there, the service wasn't so great. Like most mom & pop Asian restaurants in the area, Me Lyng employs (who I'm assuming are) the management/owner's teenage children. All but one of them are good servers. If you get the one that isn't, you'll know within the first 2 minutes! Here's a hint, it's the girl who's playing on her phone. \n\nIf you're shopping at the Waterfront, cross over the tracks and eat here!"
2,"Sometimes I love this place, sometimes I cannot stand it. It depends on how busy they are and who is working. One time I had one of the best waitresses I've ever had. Another time I had a waitress I'm pretty sure was coked up. Meh. You never know.\n\nThe food, however, is always decent bar food. I really the shady sticks and the \""pretzel.\"" I like the appetizers in general. I love their bloody marys. Good burgers. Large salads. Lots of add-on options for any sandwich, salad, burger, etc.\n\nOver-priced cocktails, but decent specials. Good beer choice usually. All in all, it's a decent place. I take friends here who are visiting from elsewhere because it's close to my apartment and had something to offer everyone."
0,We ordered Samuel Adams seasonal late December and they gave us 6$ beers of skunky old octoberfest. When we asked to switch it out because it went bad they just handed us back the bottle of old beer we already took a sip of. Bad service. They don't care.
2,"Don't go to Dos for authentic Mexican food or stellar service, you'll be disappointed.  Go to Dos for a fun atmosphere, good Happy hour and cheap \""bar\"" food... then you'll be pleased!  Dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town.  It has all the essentials, food, ATM, toilets and a huge selection of booze!"
4,"free and gorgeous must-do!! if it's your first time to watch it, try to get a spot at the center/front of the fountain (facing bellagio) since you get the best view and sound there."
0,"This place as gone way down hill with service. I use to tell everyone how great it is, and if you haven't been in a bout 6 months.. Don't go, just hold on to that memory of a great place. No one there seems to give a hoot about the customers. one of many examples- I phoned my order in, i drove up there (knowing it would be ready).. i paid the cashier, watched her walk over and grab my food... and then she just started chatting with a cook, for several minutes i watch as she held my togo box SIDEWAYS.. i finally walked over and just asked for it, and she handed it over..sideways and all... and this as been the norm now, just a total lack of care about the customer experience. \nAnother time i placed a Togo order, i paid, she said it wasn't ready... 15 minutes later she grabs a box that has been sitting on the counter since before i got there and hands it to me."
1,"Great concept and atmosphere, but that is all!  The food at Culinary Dropout is a complete joke for what you pay.  To make matters worse every server there is a hipster trying to make their parents proud by finding a job, making service absolutely dreadful, expect for Colin ( he was great, not even our server).  They claim the place is kid friendly, yet they yell at kids for being kids and are more concerned about their precious ping pong tables then their guests.  Don't even get me started on the fact that you have to valet park which is supposedly free, yet you have to tip= scam.\n\n  I recommend staying away from this place unless you have two hours of your life you never want to get back and that is just waiting for a table.."
3,"FINALLY!!!! PEOPLE THAT KNOW HOW TO DO NAILS!!!!!!!!\n\nafter recently moving from Florida to Arizona I was LOST when it came to finding a new salon. I chose a salon out of convenience at first which damn near destroyed my nails. No bueno. I thought all hope was lost and I was just destined to not my nails look like anything but what a raptor with leprosy's claws would. No joke. Wasn't cute.\n\nMani pedi day rolled around and my friend searched high and low for a perfect salon when her other friend suggested this one... and we totally decided that it was worth me driving from Scottsdale to Chandler to find out.\n\nI got the Classic Spa Pedicure. Was a little miffed that no one bothered to inform me that this did not include callus removal, but that's ok. The massage was a little weak, but hey... She was a tiny little lady. The job she did on my toes seeeeeriously made up for it. Just... wow. Clean and thorough and just wonderful AND she was a total sweetheart that carried a super awesome conversation the whole way through.\n\nMy nail guy? Patience of a saint. Seriously. He did some serious surgery to get my old nasty raptor claws off and nearly took his own eye out in the process, poor poor guy. I apologize for the sheer amount of bulbous gel and acrylic you had to hammer through!!!! \n\nHe was FAST and EFFICIENT and did a FANTASTIC job!!!! I LOVE my nails! I love their shape! I LOVE the detail in my designs!!!!\n\nThe only thing I did NOT love about this place? Our appointment was at 5:10 - no one looked at us until 5:30, my friend sat until 6:00 and I sat in the pedi-chair while my water went from perfectly deliciously hot to freezing cold before my pedicurist sat with me. She left mid-job to finish the toes of another client. They lost a star there, but other than that? This place is AMAZING!!!! I WILL be back!"
1,Over priced and not that good... it's across the street from my home i've eaten there twice in 10+ years... Skip.
3,"We just wandered into this place. The sandwiches (we had steak and fish) were great. The french fries were VERY good and quite different. The waiter (Very nice and helpful) said that the recipe and the way they were cooked were a secret. Best fries we ever tasted. If we are ever in Montreal again, we would stop by for another lunch or dinner."
2,"Decent little place, better tasting, quicker and cheaper than Coldstone (IMHO) but the ice cream has that soft, gummy-ish consistency that is common with \""mix-in\"" places."
1,"so I came here on a Tuesday night, with 4 other girls. I guess one of the girls knew a guy who worked there because 1st we went into the lounge where we had bottle service then after mayev 30 mins he took us upstairs to the nightclub. It was packed inside. Another guy who worked at the club got me a drink and then took me and my friend to the stage. we dance up there for awhile and then left. The club was okay, maybe wouldve been more fun if I was drunk."
4,"Came here for happy hour and enjoyed the daily bruschetta (which had some pork butter that was very awesome and savory to the point where I would take the corners/pieces of the bread that had no pork butter and dip it back on the plate for the fallen drips of pork butter!), funghi pizza with various roasted mushrooms, pecorino cheese and mozzarella and sauce, and the BB&T cocktail out on the patio. The waiter was a very happy-go-lucky and hilarious guy! Had a great time and will come back again!"
4,Amelia was recommended to us for hair and makeup for our 1 year anniversary photo shoot for me and she was fabulous! I have never felt so beautiful in my entire life and I am a retired beauty queen! She was so much fun and felt like I had known her forever by the time she left!
1,"Granted, Taco Bell isn't going to be a five-star experience, but this one is average even for Taco Bell.  Every time I've gone through the drive-through, they've forgotten something or put in the wrong item.  I stopped using their drive through."
4,BLOWN AWAY! \n\nI'll post a full review soon I just had to say they were amazing & we highly recommend! \n\nEverything was amazing! See photos I'm uploading shortly =)
4,"It looks like this will be my first time to be first to review something.  Fun!  \n\nAfter some hefty internet searching and reading (lots on TripAdvisor), I settled on Channings as my home base for a couple of vacationg/personal days that I was spending in Edinburgh after a long London-Cardiff-Glasgow trip.  It is part of the Town House Company, a boutique chain that operates other properties in the city.  While one of their less expensive offerings, it was still a bit of a splurge for me (especially when you consider the GBP to USD conversion), but I wanted a nice, personal 4-star place.\n\nChannings is small and operates on a very old world scale.  It is situated in a couple of connected town houses in a residential area (but that's easily walkable to the center of Edinburgh).  Upon my arrival, the front desk person checked me in quickly and directed me to my room.  The room was quite small (though I know I had one of the cheapest ones, so it's to be expected and I didn't mind), but well-appointed (really handsomely decorated) with nice sheets on the bed, a decently sized desk, and bathroom with tub.  There was a basket with coffee/tea makings and some biscuits as well.  And there was (I think) free wifi, which is always appreciated.  I don't watch TV when I travel so I honestly don't recall if there was one for sure, but I think there was.  The view from my windows was really quite picturesque.  I think that the only drawback for me was the lack of bathrobe(s).  For a 4-star place this nice, it would seem to fit...and makes for nice lounging about.\n\nThe service by the staff is quite detail-oriented.  I received emails from Scott, the concierge prior to my stay (separate from the confirmation emails), asking if I had questions or any special needs.  He was immensely helpful in accepting a package there on my behalf prior to my arrival.  And when I was having trouble with the radiator on the bathtub one evening and called the reception desk, they sent him right up.  He was quite friendly (and didn't make me feel silly for not knowing how to work it).  The rest of the front desk staff was equally helpful with questions and directions (minus one instance on my last day in which I was misguided to the bus stop for the airport bus...which could have been disastrous, had I not found a nice local, walking the streets who helped me out).  The same woman did do me a nice favor, however, in letting me pay part of the balance of my bill in GBP (so as to get rid of them before leaving the UK) and the rest via credit card.\n\nMy breakfasts were included in my room rate.  They were served in the downstairs restaurant.  While the convenience was appreciated, they were just OK and nothing terribly special (though I should admit that I found that I'm simply not a fan of the full Scottish breakfast...or English/Welsh elsewhere).  My dinners there, however, were quite nice.  One evening, I had the simple, but exquisite homemade pie and mash.  The pie was excellent and overflowed with tender venison, cooked perfectly, and hearty vegetables.  The next evening, I had a lovely salad packed with goat cheese and a fantastic duck entree (in which the duck was a perfect medium rare)...and some sort of yummy, but not too heavy dessert.  The wines were reasonably priced, as I recall.  Both times I ate in the more casual bar area (as opposed to the more formal place settings in other rooms).  It was fine and pleasant, but the feel and decor seemed incongruous with the rest of the establishment (though it seemed to be a neighborhood hang out for some...which has a nice, casual feel).  Service was attentive, but nothing overwhelming. \n\nIt's a quiet hotel, which I liked.  I slept well and easily (due not only to running myself hard sightseeing all day, but also the peace and the quality of the bed/sheets).  I enjoyed the quaint, refined feel (In addition to the handsome bedrooms, the lobby is also quite attractive, with lots of beautifully upholstered chairs).  And as I mentioned, though it's set off a bit from the city center, it's quite convenient if you enjoy walking.\n\nI had a lovely time at Channings.  It's a classy establishment that enhanced my experience in Scotland.  I'd pick it over the larger hotels any day, I'm guessing for personality and charm."
0,"Expensive gimmick.  Missleading website.  Wide angle lens camera makes it look big but is smaller than my kitchen.  For $25 dollars to get in, it was a real disappointment.  We felt ripped off.  Plus the free drink was absolutely aweful; it reminded me of the trash can parties we went to in college."
4,"Love love love their happy hour! Much better then their competitor across the road (sushi station) their happy hour had great prices and a great selection! We had 7 people fed and it was still under $120. Not bad for about 10 rolls and 5 appetizers plus who knows how many drinks. We will definitely be returning. Although I was a little disappointed with their Tuna Poke; I've had better. Still 5 stars in my book though, just wouldn't order that again."
1,"Really hate to do this, but this was my favorite bar to eat at until now! I didn't realize they switched to No One Under 21 till I walked in with my kids for dinner and was told that we had to leave! No sign posted anywhere! They have great food here and I'll never go back because the obvious didn't care about local families when the decided to allow smoking! What's wrong with the patio if you want to smoke?"
0,"I have lived at this property for almost two years.  Since the new owners have taken over (July 2013), this place has gone down hill in every way possible.  One of the better things about this complex when I moved in was the utilities (paid partially by myself and partially by the owners).  During the summer my AC was on 24/7, my electric bill was never over $120, for the last few months I have notice a pretty good increase in my bill (last bill was $160), which I can't seem to justify, since I have not yet even turned my heat on and rarely cook, am rarely home, therefore electricity or water should not be being used hardly at all.  After speaking with some neighbors who have also noticed this happening, it was brought to my attention that every vacant apartment in the complex has all the lights on 24/7.  Since the new owners took over the property there have been a lot more vacancies.  Now I understand why my electric has increased, I am paying to keep all those vacant apartments well lit all day and all night.  I brought this to the attention of management and was basically patronized and spoke to in a very condescending way by one of the staff members, which also by the way are all new since the new owners, also are all very rude and completely unconcerned with current tenants.  \n\nThis complex has gone from a once very decent Scottsdale apartment to what seems like a shady, unkept South Phoenix apartment.  These new owners are absolutely horrible and are robbing each and every tenant monthly on our utility bills.  Coincidentally I signed my new lease with the previous owners exactly 3 days prior to the new ones taking over, nobody ever mentioned there would be new owners.  I'm hoping between the utility robbing and my lease being signed with a different management company I will be able to get out of it and get the heck out of that complex.  I strongly would NOT recommend this complex to anyone.  I agree 100% with Jeff H on the rating for new management, in fact -9.5 stars is probably being a little kind.\n\nThere is a very good reason why there are so many vacancies Ben S.,  the place is a dump!!!!!!"
4,"This is as good as it gets, and is setting the bar higher for the rest of the Strip. Everything is fresh, always, and the recipes are considered and nuanced, but still very approachable versions of street food from around the world. \n\nI'm a bigger guy, and I can put away the groceries. So you know when I am eating slowly, it's really good. The Thin Man is just plain delicious."
1,"This review is for the observation deck only as I did not have time for any of the restaurants. It's a fun thing to do but honestly I was underwhelmed by the guest service. I was there on 3/31/13. The line was decently long, however there was trash everywhere. In a 15 min wait I saw so many food wrappers and bottles left in line by guests, where is the clean staff? The elevator ride was fast, and there was a fairly old operator but barely spoke any English and nobody could understand the speech he was attempting to give. The view was nice enough, but trying to get down we waited in a room of clustered elevators and literally the first 3 we tried we couldn't go to the ground on, they only served the restaurants and club up there. However there was no sign as to which one would take us down and the operators there seemed peterbed the more people asked them which one. The lady on the way down was better but was kind of boring. None of them smiled or seemed to like being there. Now in reality, I'm an elevator operator at the Space Needle in Seattle, and was quite surprised at the lack of enthusiasm and service from the staff compared to the level of service I personally am used to giving. I was excited to meet operators from the stratosphere and talk shop but they seemed so bored and blah I didn't bother. The Eiffel Tower on the strip is a WAY better view."
2,"I stayed here a few months ago.. just a one night getaway.. we got a really great deal, but certainly did not get our moneys worth. \n\nFirst of all, both ice machines were broken, so we couldn't get ice. When I called the front desk, they told me that they were too busy to send any to the room, but I could go to the bar to get some. That made me mad, yes. \n\nSecond, the restaurant was not serving food because evidently there had been a flood in the kitchen in recent days. \n\nThird, there was a gap about an inch high under our door, so every bug known to man was crawling in the room. It only amplified when it started to rain. Fortunately we are crafty and we bunched some towels up under the door. \n\nThe bed was comfy, they have good plasma screen TV's, the shower was dope and they had a cool pool... but they had some serious issues that will prevent me from staying here again."
1,"This place was ok, the burger was overcooked and dry, the staff was very friendly and helpful, but the prices are ridonkulous for what it is. This is a fast food place with prices of a high end burger joint. Its good in a pinch, but I wouldn't bother again"
1,Service is HORRIBLE. They didn't even answer the phone & I called 4X. And its not the first time. I get here & it's not that busy. Im not sure what happened to the other young lady but she greeted everyone w a smile. I come here weekly but that is coming to an end and FAST. Im so disappointed. My fav place is now becoming a bad experience. Hope the owners are reading the reviews because the young lady here now is not cutting it & you are losing a faithful weekly customer
1,"This is a tricky review to write as I do enjoy Fatburger products but the service is inconsistent. Often times they forget to add the extras that you order for your burger. On several occasions I have ordered bacon on my burger and have gotten home to discover no bacon was ever added. About half of the time something is wrong. The staff is friendly and helpful but many of them are not properly trained. Often the credit/debit machine is out of order. Compared with In-N-Out Burger the wait time is very long. Sometimes I have had to wait 20 to 30 minutes for one burger, not to mention that the store wasn't even crowded! I would hate to see what would happen if a lunch crowd came in. 2 Stars."
1,"I am so torn...I really want to like this place. The beer is good, not too expensive either. The atmosphere is festive but tries too hard, in my humble opinion. The service was good. The food....that's where they lose me. I won't travel off the strip unless the place offers 1. great service 2. good drinks 3. good food and 4. a good atmosphere. This place misses the mark on the food and the other three things aren't enough to compensate."
4,"Oh man...A+...Boyfriend took me here for dinner to celebrate our anniversary and it couldn't have been more perfect. We are vegan, and they even had a wonderful tofu dish on the menu...Everything we ordered was amazing and delicious. Service was outstanding and I would highly recommend this place for a special occasion or weekend cocktails. :)"
2,I stayed here recently when I came for a friend's wedding.  The service was very friendly and helpful.  The room was spacious and faced the Strip.  When we checked in the woman at the front desk gave us a corner room on the 32nd floor and it was an awesome view.  We also had a blast in the Center Bar in the casino both nights we were there.  Definitely a great place to stay if you are on a budget and can get a deal from Vinnie!
4,"Everything was wonderful.  Had my birthday dinner here, party of 20. The staff were accommodating,  Mark was attentive and the food.. yum.com. Love dining here!"
1,"Mediocre food and service. I used to work as a sushi chef so I can get kind of picky.\n\n You can taste how old the rice was, the rolls barely had filling, were bland, unseasoned, and messy. \n\nI went out of my way for this restraunt and I was disappointed. The only thing okay about this place is the price, but you seriously get what you pay for."
1,"OK, OK... I finally went and ate at a Hooters while I was on a business trip.  Their supposedly best hot wings aren't even close to being the best.  The food wasn't all that either...  Sure, there's pretty girls prancing around with their old school bright orange old school NBA short shorts, but it doesn't make the food taste any better. Then again, I guess you don't really go to Hooters for the food. =P\n\nRecommendations: N/A"
3,"This is a really good camera store. I generally buy most of my equipment on amazon but I was in a pinch and went to this store for the first time and was surprised. I recently purchased a camera tripod dolly on Amazon for $59.00 waited a week for it to get here and when I went into this store they had the exact same dolly for the exact same price. They also have a really good selection of tripods and in addition to other gear you simply won't find at Frys, Best Buy or other camera stores."
3,"Vons can be on the pricey side but when they have good deals they are good. They have a good rewards program they personalizes deals according to the things you but most. Although I only bought wooden bamboo skewers ones and it at times offers coupons for that. The produce section is big. I like getting red and green bell peppers for my hot dogs here because the produce at Walmart is more times than not bad. The bakery here is cool because they always change the types of baked good offered but still have the favorites. Now if they could only have those mini bear claws stocked more often (they sell out quick)! They have a good variety of meat and the butcher is always willing trim anything fresh or the way you ant it. I stay way from the lunch meats here since they don't offer Boar's Head and I'm not a fan of the type they to have. There is a Panda Express near the produce department that is convenient when I want to grab lunch/dinner and groceries in one shot. The lines can be long so some self check out registers might come in handy for those only picking up a few items. For those who have no vehicle or means to get to Vons, they offer delivery. My Dad is handicapped and not able to shop for himself. He has used the delivery from Vons for years and they are always so cool about unloading his groceries in the kitchen for him."
3,"Solid asian food at reasonable prices for the strip.\n\nYellow curry chicken, Basil beef fried rice, and the Tamarind Ribeye are probably my favorites. \n\nWhat I really love though is the dessert. Mango Sticky Rice is simple and amazing. Bua Loi is also great.\n\nThis place will probably never \""wow\"" you, but it rarely disappoints, and they serve pretty much any kind of asian food."
0,"I got food poisoning from their food after talking to the hostess about the poor service we received. They were very rude and,  I'm guessing,  did something to my food.  Horrible experience!"
2,"The location is convenient, it's nice & comfy, their espresso drinks are fine. But their iced coffee tastes like chemicals and/or liquor, not for me. I feel like this is something you need to have down for a coffee shop in Phoenix. I really wanted to love this place but after multiple visits, I won't be going out of my way to go there."
1,"I know it's been almost two weeks since Nascar was at PIR but I needed some time to let this experience marinade with me. My friend had called and asked if I wanted to go to this\""joyus\"" event and I thought about it for a minute and asked myself how bad could it really be? \n\nWell besides the bomb ass tickets we got from my friends boss I was completely taken back by the whole freakin' secret society that attend this event... It was insane to say the least. I would have to recommend buying the headphones with the little tv ($30) so you can tune into any driver and hear what is really going on in the race because you can't hear crap coming out of the speakers. \n\nNow, I would have to compare Nascar to hockey, the only good thing about a hockey game is a good fight. Same with Nascar, race is pretty boring without the crashes. Now I'm not going out to this event in the hopes that someone is going to get seriously injured so it was nice to see some cars get smashed up without injury. \n\nNow my biggest complaint, if you plan on going to an event with AT LEAST 100,000 people, please don't get bent out of shape if someone's jacket rubs your arm. So to the lady that lost it at the hot dog stand because my jacket touch your arm, you should have accepted the water I was offering you and NOT CONTINUED DRINKING. Also, if you plan on rolling your eyes at someone and talking shit don't start crying when they confront you and run to your husband like he is going to help you out of the situation your drunk ass got yourself in. \n\nAll in all it was a good experience but probably not something I would ever go to again."
4,"Finally! An exceptional bakery and coffee shop in the West Valley! The place is fairly hidden, in a non-descript  strip mall on the east side of  51st Ave just north of Thunderbird but worth the effort. Their coffee is exceptional but my current fav is an iced Jujube fruit and black tea. I'm addicted. We're eating our way through their pastries; the croissants remind me of the ones I enjoyed in France. And their homemade chocolate-dipped biscotti  and Meringues (both Pistachio and Strawberry) are heavenly. There is a very particular German woman at work who gave very high marks to their Pear Financier Tarts (us too). And don't ignore their sandwiches and salads. They have a build-your-own sandwich for $5.25 that puts to shame the same sandwich with much lower quality ingredient at Sprouts for$ 2.99. And where else can you get handmade chocolate stilettos (for real)! We are delighted to finally have this level of quality in the bakery coffee and chocolate department on our side of town."
0,"My husband and I walked in about 8:30 on a Wednesday night and asked for a table for 2.  The hostess was completely thrown that we had just walked in and didn't have a reservation.  As in, she really didn't know what to do.  As she sat there looking confused and looking around the restaurant, my husband suggested that we could grab a drink at the bar while she figured it out.  She looked relieved and went off to talk to a gentleman who worked there (we presumed about our seating).  \n\nMeanwhile husband ordered a martini, and I a glass of $18 wine.  At least it was a big pour.  The wine list was out of control expensive without being out of control excellent.  My baseline is Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label - in the local wine stores here, I can buy it retail for $35-40/bottle.  On this menu, it was $125.  After having a tremendous bottle of Rioja the night before at Stripsteak (at $85) that we were still reminiscing about while at the bar, we decided that by the glass was probably the best way to go.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we determined that our previous night's meal was so good, that neither of us would be opposed to going back if we weren't going to be seated by the end our our drinks.  Ten minutes later, husband paid the bar tab, the hostess was nowhere to be seen, and we took off for another delicious steak down the strip."
1,"I am sad to say that it has really gone downhill. For lunch there is no prime rib, just roast beef. The sushi was obviously refrigerated with hard rice. One of my pork chile verde was still pink inside. The trout Proven\u00e7al had little flavor. However the dessert selection is great! So many different flavors of gelato! Therefore if you get the buffet of buffets ($45 with a player's card and they are enforcing a player's card for each person doing the buffet of buffets) it would be worth it to go for dessert but not the food."
0,"I can't actually \""review\"" this place, because the person who came up to \""assist\"" me was so rude I actually drove off. \n\nIt was my first trip there, so I was looking at the various options - however, they weren't listed lowest-to-most-expensive, so I was having a bit of a slow time of it. Clerk came up to me & asked me what I wanted - he noticed I had a coupon so he immediately tried to sell the higher-priced washes - I can't really blame him, but all I wanted was a car wash & windows cleaned. \n\nI finally said that all I wanted was wash/windows, and I found the service I wanted on the board (I forget what it was called) and told him that I wanted \""xyz\"" wash (which was listed for $12.95). He said, \""twelve, or seventeen?\"" Um, what? Each service had it's own price, so I repeated, the \""xyz\"" wash. He literally rolled his eyes and walked off! I decided I didn't need this & drove off. \n\nWell, I know where *not* to go when I get my car detailed next time ... Perhaps they're only polite when you order an expensive service, but I'm not eager to find out."
3,Food was good but not amazing -- lots of eccentric tastes to be honest but a cool environment. Very small portions for the amount you pay but I enjoyed my visit here overall.
4,"Rating for \""Spa Journey Only\"" - In short, Cory, journey concierge, was amazing and this treatment is spectacular!!  I told Cory we should rename this treatment and call it the Post-Jet Treatment.   Fresh off a plane, I was in the treatment room within 45 minutes of getting to the hotel. :-)\n\nSome quick notes:\n- I typically get cold during body scrubs and wraps.  Nope, not here.  The room was warm, the ground was warm, and the stone was warm.   My body temperature consistently stayed warm throughout.\n- Everything for the treatment is in one room: Steam Room, Room Temperature Jetted Tub, Ice Cold Water, Ice Cold Towels. And buckets and buckets of warm water :-)\n- I think the water being thrown on my body was the best part of the treatment next to the way Cory was able to knead out the kinks in my back with a gentle hand.\n- I don't have a gender preference for my therapists.  However, I did think twice before allowing a make therapist to apply a treatment to my body.  Well, again, Cory was the ultimate professional.   I can't have asked him to be more appropriate.  :-)\n\nI consider myself to be an expert spa goer; so I always have material to compare to.   That being said, this was one of the best treatments I've ever had by one of the best therapists I've ever had.\n\nWay to wind down from a few weeks of travel - I'll be back to see Cory in the future!"

2,"Nice little shaved ice cone, but 25 minutes for ice and syrup? Give me a break"
1,Went to Buca to try the one of the new winning recipes that were on Ty Pennington's restaurant show.  Could only order one of the 2 - the gnocci were not made in house & were not recommended.  The zucchini pasta was ordered.  This was supposed to have ribbons of zucchini & pasta tossed in a garlic basil cream sauce with roasted graped tomatoes & basil chiffonade & cheese on top.  The zucchini ribbons were not visible & garlic basil cream sauce was just an alfredo sauce.  Overall taste was good - but not what was offered on the menu.  If I hadn't watched the tv show & saw how this dish was prepared ( twice actually) - I wouldn't know any better.  I guess that I will have to make this myself if I want to taste the real dish.
1,"After three strikes, I've given up on Metro Market.  I knew something was wrong when they didn't have any deli containers the day after they opened.  Did the store opening catch all of the staff by surprise?\n\nLast week, I bought some strawberries that they had on sale.  The berries were mushy and moldy when I got them home.  I suggested to the store manager that they refrigerate their perishable produce like Piggly Wiggly does rather than leave it sit out on display tables at room temperature.\n\nThe final strike was last week when I got sick on some deli meat.  When the deli girl opened the package of Dietz and Watson turkey (it was the display package), she even commented on how much juice was leaking out of it.  She had to get a wad of paper towels to sop it all up.  The meat that I bought continued to leak liquid and made a mess in my lunch box.  The diarrhea started a few hours after I ate it.  I threw the rest out.  When Copps handled Dietz and Watson deli meat, one of the deli people told me it had a much shorter shelf life than Jennie-O and other brands.\n\nFrom now on, I won't waste my time or money at Metro Market.  I'll drive the extra distance to Copps in Sun Prairie or go over to Piggly Wiggly just down the road in Cottage Grove."
4,"I have been coming here for 7 years and LOVE it!!! It's family owned, they are fantastic.  They have watched my kids grow. You can't go wrong with any of the food, SUPERB!!!!"
4,"I was taken here by a Japanese friend.  Yes the place is small.  Only about 30 seats.  I'd suggest no parties over 4 people.  It's a cozy room with 5 seats at the counter so I'd even be tempted to go there solo.\n\nThe food is quality!  And while I may not be a connoisseur it's seems more authentic over the more popular izakaya restaurants in town.  Memorable menu items.  Their homemade tofu!!  Grilled tendon, kobe beef,  foie gras, mochi wrapped in aburaage and ahi collar.  Desserts:  Cheesecake and watermelon sorbet.  \n\nI'm definitely goin back!"
1,"Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant has been a local family owned business in Vegas for over 30 years. I ate here a few times growing up and didn't like it so when a friend suggested that hubby and I meet for dinner here I was hesitant, but figured why not give it another shot after so long. \n\nWe were seated next to the bar (bar was dead) and service was very good. We were started off with the usual suspects... Chips & salsa. The chips were good however the salsa had no kick at all and was very sweet, almost like it was just a can of thinned tomato paste. Gross! \n\nAll dinners are served with a soup or salad. I chose the \""Tortilla Soup\"" and it actually didn't taste bad. I ordered the #29 \""Taco and Enchilada\"" priced at $13.50 plus an additional $2.15 because I wanted carnitas in my taco. The beans and rice that accompanied my meal were either under a heat lamp for too long or reheated. The beans were crunchy and hard around the edges and the had no good flavor. The rice was pretty much the same. The green sauce on my enchilada had great flavor it was just that the enchilada itself wasn't that great. It was edible, but the tortilla was stiff. The carnitas had good flavor, but again I wasn't crazy about the tortilla. Our friend ordered the #14 \""Chile Relleno and Enchilada\"" priced at $13.50 and they thought it was decent. Hubby ordered the #27 \""Fajitas Dona Maria\"" (beef) priced at $14.75 and said that he's had better.\n\nI wanted to try the \""Churros\"" priced at $5.50 for dessert. It was presented well, but all of the cinnamon sugar was on the plate not on the churros. These churros were very dry and not worth a penny. \n\nThough I have no plans to purposely come back here, I did give it 2 stars because the service really was very good and I did enjoy my soup. I believe they try hard to do something good here at Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant, it just isn't good enough for me.\n\nThey claim to be knows for their \""Tamales\"" and even though I haven't tried them here, I have heard from people that they are worth picking up. Prices are $3.95 each, $14.25 for a half dozen, and $19.25 for a dozen. They offer the following tamales:\n\nRed - pulled pork in a mild sauce\nGreen - shredded chicken in hot sauce\nCheese - monterrey jack, green chilies and onions\nSweet - pineapple and raisins ($3.30 each)"
3,"For starters, we had the Endive Lettuce Boat with Shrimp. It's a bit pricey, but it's definitely a \""must-order\"". The shrimps are very chewy and not dry, and they give generous portion of shrimps (about 3-4 shrimps per boat).\n\nFor soup, I had the wonton soup, and my girlfriend had the hot & spicy soup. The portion is not huge (which is expected given that the soup is only $3-4). Of the two, we would recommend the hot & spicy soup. The wontons are delicious, but the soup tastes just like regular water.\n\nI ordered the rainbow roll, which is extremely delicious. All the ingredients are fresh, and everything was perfect.\n\nMy girlfriend had the sushi club, which was that night's feature. It is like a sushi sandwich. The toast is replaced by rice and soy crepe. The insides are ingredients that you would found in those specialty rolls. I would definitely come back and order this again."
2,This Albertsons (or Krogers if your from my neck of the woods) is typically clean with fast and friendly workers.  This place is never seems busy and always stays fully stocked.  The checkout here is usually very fast.\n\nThe Produce selection is great and usually stocked with fresh selections.  Only a few times I've been let down by the choice of Jalapenos or peppers.\n\nThe Meat department is great.  I've gotten some choice Fillet Mignon here that was excellent.  One time I got some Ribeyes and cooked them with some Weber steak seasoning for me and my Mom and she said is was the best steak she ever had.  Make sure you get it from the butchers table and not the prepackage deal.\n\nThey have a wing station setup right where you enter that has a good selection of wings for far less than any wing restaurant but just as good.  Sometimes I'll get 3 chicken strips because they are really good.\n\nThe only drawback is that sometimes the products here are significantly more expensive than Wal Mart.  But sometimes its worth it not to have to deal with the long lines and crowd.
4,"This was a great show. I got tix at at local tix4tonight booth for $120.00 for a pair and it was well worth it. I ended up in the 2nd row as close as you want to get trust me. The jokes are crude but funny as all hell. The performers were great and the show was long which is good. The seating is tight, as I had a heavy gal next to me that her legs were touching mine and she was all wierd about it. The wood chairs are wire tied together so moving them farther apart won't happen. All in all this is a must see show best show Iv'e seen for the money in vegas."
2,"Yup.  It's good.  The food is VERY good.  The service is a bit slow.  Hence only 3 stars.  We were there when it wasn't even half full and had to wait and wait for our check, then a to-go box later.  Kind of a waste of time.  We had better service before when they were swamped in the AM on a Saturday.  This was late lunch on a Monday. Should have been better.  The Cincy Chili though, is impressive."
0,"I have had (almost) nothing but horrible experiences with the management since moving in. My girlfriend and I originally planned to move into Hawthorne in February, but due to our work schedules had to move in sooner. When I called- on a Thursday- to ask about moving the date up I was told that they'd have the unit I wanted & that was listed as available ready by the end of the weekend since it was an \""upgraded\"" unit. Two weeks later when it's finally \""ready\"" I picked up our keys (which were the incorrect ones) and learned that we had no running water because they had cut it off due to doing a horrible job redoing our tub. On top of that, our heat didn't work. At all. For probably the first 3-4 weeks that we were here. In January. Luckily we have a fabulous maintenance man, Sharron, who went above & beyond what we expected and even left his personal space heater here for us. The \""upgrades\"" are awful, apparently painting over super old cabinets is something to pay $200 extra for per month, and we went at least a month with a random kitchen drawer missing. Now that we're about 9 months into our lease, I can honestly say that moving to this complex has been a huge mistake. \n\nSince the buildings are so old and the appliances suck we end up with huge power bills and even went through a 3 month long phase where we couldn't have our tv turned on while the microwave was running without having a circuit blow. Which generally wouldn't be a problem, but the circuit breakers aren't located in each unit, they're all located in one person's unit per building. Management knew of the issue and their suggestion was \""to get to know our neighbors.\"" Finally after multiple issues (& complaints to corporate) involving our electricity- including going without power in the 1st floor of our unit for 17 hours- it has been resolved. You basically have to beg & plead to have maintenance issues resolved in a somewhat timely manner. There's also a huge issue with the online rent payment & destruction of the property by random neighborhood kids. \n\nYes, this is cheap for Plaza Midwood but it absolutely is not worth it."
0,"I've given this place a try on 3 different occasions since it seems to get such great reviews.  The first time  I went, I ordered the tenderloin, medium cooked.  They overcooked the steak the first shot, so I sent it back.  The second shot was WAY undercooked, but I didn't send it back again.\n\nThe second time I went for lunch, I ordered the steak sandwich.  I ordered it medium, yet once again it was undercooked.  I didn't send it back because the people I was with kept on telling me how good a restaurant it was, and so I didn't send it back because I didn't want them to look bad..  So instead, I choked down my undercooked steak sandwich.\n\nThis last time I ordered the scallops.  They did not taste fresh at all.  Over $30 for 3 fishy tasting scallops????\n\nThis place has a stuffy atmosphere and horrible food.  I will never go back."
2,"While people will swear to this cuisine's authenticity, it feels a bit overhyped. Almost like they're trying too hard. The flavor is there, but the techniques feel very Americanized. The portion/dish sizes are also very small for the price you pay. Depending on your party size and appetite, you could be looking at 1.5-2 dishes per person.\n\nThe menu is inspired by Cantonese and Szechuan cuisines, but feels more fusion than anything else. Don't get me wrong; you'll find some legit dishes here. But most of them have been adjusted for the American palette.\n\nThere's also a DJ bumping club hits so I couldn't help but bounce my head all throughout dinner..."
0,I am a hugeeee sweets lover so I was pumped about this place...unfortunately I was let down. Me and my girlfriend split a big ice cream sundae surrounded by cookies. The ice cream was nothing special and the cookies were so stale!! What a let down. Should have done there famous frozen hot choc I guess
1,"It was a nice clean room. But I got in late about 11pm so the 3rd shift Guy was on duty. Well they lock the doors before 11 so he answer with a horrible attitude.  He asked if I had a reservation I was like \""duh\"" I'm here at this time of night. He let me in so we can do checks in. He (Billy) had the worse personality if my reservation had not been prepaid I'd left.  I got to bed late so I didn't till about 11:20am oh you would have thought the earth had shaken 2people came by my room told me check out was at 11am. Then I was told they give me to noon. Thank you for the courtesy which should have been a given considering the economic situation Phoenix is in.  Not like they were crawling with customers. So glad I'm changing to the embassy suites. Last night was just a crash pad for I got to Phoenix early."
0,"Until the owners get the quality of the pizza back up to where it once was I decided to try one of their pasta dishes and ordered the lasagna last week. At $11.75 I expected better.\n\nAccording to the menu it's served with bread, butter, and salad. The lasagna itself was uneventful and dry with no where near enough sauce. Basically it appeared as unseasoned plain browned hamburger meat and some cheese wrapped like a burrito with the pasta, sauce, some more cheese, and baked in a foil bowl no where near long enough to even heat it thoroughly and melt the cheeses. \n\nThe bread appeared to be a sub roll, not toasted garlic bread like most Italian restaurants would serve. And they forgot the butter, which definitely would have helped get that dry bread down!\n\nThe salad consisted of a small container of prepackaged lettuce, shreaded cheese and black olives. And not the freshest I've encountered. And don't expect home made ranch dressing, again, prepackaged. Maybe I'll try another pasta dish in the future to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the spaghetti is better. \n\nSo this week I decided to try the hot wings. How hard can it be to screw up buffalo wings? Apparently it's pretty easy! The wing sauce was served on the side, which I liked, but whomever was manning the fryer left them in WAY too long and burnt them to a crisp! YUCK! I guess burnt chicken is better than raw chicken. And again, prepackaged ranch dressing. (Hint hint - Hidden Valley Ranch mix is available in a restaurant size. Just add butter milk and mayo and you're good to go!)\n\nI really wish these folks would get their quality control issues addressed. You can't cut corners in the restaurant business and expect to survive on your reputation alone. And that's the ONLY reason I'm still giving them the benefit of the doubt."
3,"The front desk staff are all nice, but every now and then when I sneak up on the class the teachers are talking and the kids are everywhere. Standing on the desk, playing with the water. Its chaos, but just like any daycare, its not perfect. \n\nI've also sneaked up and seen the teachers educating the kids with song and playtime. Its an awesome place to take your kids too. My little one has learned a lot and loves to sing. Its all because of this place. It is pricey though compared to other places.\n\nAs of 11/18 I pay 235 a week for my 21 month old... If I had to leave, this would be the reason why, but my daughter loves it so much I don't have the hear to take her out."
3,Danielle's professionalism and quality of the alteration I received deserve 5 stars however the procedures used to estimate and charge the client are in need of improvement.
2,"Reception area was nice and cozy. We checked in at the member's lounge and got some free soda. Hence the 3 stars.\n\nWe stayed at a 2 bedroom suite with a full kitchen and a washer & dryer. Not too shabby. Small little patio/balcony was a nice touch. It felt like an apartment. My only beef was with the bed. Having stayed at different hotels in Vegas, their bed was not up to my diva-like standards. \n\nPool was fine. Arcade will cost ya!"
2,"We flew from Las Vegas to Washington DC with a layover in Charlotte. On the way there everything went perfectly with no problems. \nOn the way back our flight to Charlotte was delayed and we missed our connection by 10 minutes. It would have been great if they could have held the plane but I understand that is not always possible. We went to the service desk to find out if we could get on the next plane. The person who helped us was able to book us on the next flight to Las Vegas about two hours later. My only complaint was that her attitude and the attitudes of the other employees working the desk was slightly hostel and unhelpful. I am sure that get screamed at by angry passengers all the time, but it would have made our unpleasant experiences slightly better if she was positive, helpful, and most importantly apologetic."
1,"L'endroit a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 bien et c'est correct pour aller voir des spectacles m\u00e9tal. Mais la plupart du temps, l'endroit est une garderie remplie d'enfants de 17 ans avec des fausses cartes. La bi\u00e8re-eau pas buvable n'est pas ch\u00e8re et si vous commandez une vraie bi\u00e8re, on va peut-\u00eatre vous regarder d'un air bizarre."
1,"I'm not sure what I was expecting to find here, but it was in my hotel so I decided to check it out.  However, what I did find was certainly not what I expected, lol.  If you have always been wanting a beach towel with Khloe Kardashian's face on it, then look no further!! Or if you've been wanting a shirt that says, \""Kourtney is my fave\"" .. you now know where to find it! OH and it's back to school season.. get your metal lunch boxes with Kendall Jenner's face on it now! Kendall not your fave? Don't worry, they've got Kylie too! It'll go great with your new $60 sweatshirt that reads, \""Sunday Funday\"".  Sigh...can I get the 5 minutes I spent in here back please? This store reminded me of a Kardashian themed Spencer's. They even have a Wheatie's box with Bruce Jenner's autograph on it! Display only. Oh snap..\n\nComing here in will give you the opportunity to say, \""Can I charge that Kris Jenner bobble head to my room, please?\"" C'mon..where else can you ever say that phrase?!\n\nP.S. ... Lamar Odom's clothing brand \""Rich Soil\"" is all 75% off. Seeing that made stepping foot in here kind of worth it. LOL!\n\nP.S.S ... Don't forget your Kim Kardashian paper face mask!! Where else can you find that hot commodity? ;-)"
3,Yummy breakfast and Madeline was a fantastic server.
3,What red blooded 'murican man doesn't love white knee highs and short plaid skirts? I mean seriously this is the single equation to a successful bar.
2,"If you want your brain to explode... just do a Yelp search for \""yogurt\"" in the Phoenix metro area; holy shit... when did Yogurt get so popular? Have I been living under a rock or something?\n\nYogurtland\nYogurtlicious\nYogurt Builderz\nYogurtology\nYogurtini\nMojo Yogurt\nYogurBerry\n\nThese are all real places, and I could keep going here and make this review way too long if I wanted to. We've been to a few of these places recently and they're all pretty good... but to be honest if you blind folded me and made me try to distinguish one from the other; there's no way I could do it. \n\nThe idea behind these Yogurt stores gets a solid four stars... yet yogurt places like Yogurtland are gonna stay at about three and a half because they're all so much like each other. Will one particular yogurt place make a move to stand out from the others? I'm on the edge of my seat to find out. I just hope people don't get tired of Yogurt anytime soon, because if they do we're gonna have a lot of angry unemployed Yogurt-people to answer to. \n\nI still love the fact that they charge by weight... and that it's quite a bit healthier than ice cream without sacrificing taste. Yogurtland has quite a few winners in the flavor department... a few of their variations we loved were Peanut butter and Irish Mint Creme. Not bad at all...\n\n3.5/5.\n\nP.S. Yogurt in AZ = Big time Market Saturation...just sayin."
1,"Very disappointed in this place.  Don't know why, but I had high expectations.\n\nTo begin with, the person running front of house was overwhelmed.  It wasn't that busy, but she seemed very flustered.  Someone asked her if they could have a cup of coffee or a drink while they waited for the table and it looked like she was having hard time deciding if that could be pulled off.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and animated but seemed a little forgetful.  I had told him I didn't want any more Coke and about 5 minutes later he brought a fresh one anyway.  After taking our order, he came up to us asking where our menus where like he had forgotten that he took our order.  I also saw him drop a knife on the floor and he didn't pick it up.  It was just left there for a few minutes until someone else noticed it and picked it up.\n\nOn to the food.  I had the crab cake benedict and while it didn't taste bad, it sure wasn't great either.  I'd call it more like deviled crab benedict, there wasn't a lot of crab flavor.  I even closed my eyes and ate it to see if I thought it was crab without looking at it.  I found that I couldn't tell if it was a crab cake.  The menu said the hollandaise sauce was \""infused\"" with Andouille sausage but I found when it was served that it actually had chunks of sausage with it.  It didn't go together well.  Also, the green and red peppers served on the dish were too raw.  Finally, the egg was not poached well.  The yolk was way too runny for a poached egg.\n\nMy wife's omelet was good, according to her.  It was on the smaller size for the price, IMO.  Also, she asked for grits instead of potatoes.  What she got was grits AND potatoes and we were charged for both.  That's fine if they don't sub, but the waiter didn't mention it.  Same deal with the biscuit instead of the English muffin.  No mention of the upcharge."
2,"I love brisket.  I spent a few years in Lawton, Oklahoma, and every winter we would stop by one of the store where a brisket vendor would be, grab a few pounds with their homemade bbq sauce and eat that for dinner almost every night.  I never get sick of it.  Since moving back home and then here to Vegas 2 years ago, I never thought that I'd find that bbq brisket with homemade bbq sauce again.\n\nThis place has great brisket and sauce.  Their rolls are great, too!  If you want a nice, quick bbq meal any time of the year, they can do that for you.  It is voted one of the best in Vegas for 2009 and I can see why.  Although southerners may not feel as positively about this place as some of us do, it's good for the money you pay and in taste.  \n\nTheir sauce is nice and has that subtle heat you want in a bbq sauce, with a sweet finish.  I am glad that they put it to the side when you order eating in or taking out.  I love ordering to take out for dinner because it's only a 10 minute wait. Their rolls come out hot, too.  I eat those with honey butter!  \n\nThe ribs are good, too, but I've honestly had better.  I say that out of their entire menu, their brisket seems to be the best thing on it.\n\nGive it a try.  I thought it was worth the money, and we do eat here quite a bit now."
3,"Maui Rose Hawaiian BBQ is the perfect place to grab a quick bite to eat without the frills.\n\nHead up to the counter to give your order and take a seat.  Your meal should be arriving soon.\n\n#42 Combo Special \""Kalbi, Chicken Katsu Cutlet, Crunch Roll, Crispy\"" (Reg $9.50)  The Kalbi is pretty tasty, as I recall before too.  I remember The Husband not really liking the mac salad before, but this time he ate all of it.  \n\n#22 Vegetable Tempura, 10 pieces \""served with steamed rice & soup\"" ($6.50,)  Pretty decent size meal for the price you're paying.\n\nEverything on the menu is under ten dollars, and that includes the bento boxes and combination meals. What a great deal! \n\nService is efficient, and the people at the counter are nice.  It's an easy place to go, satisfies the food cravings, and doesn't break the bank.\n\n3.5 stars"
4,"after reading so many great reviews, i decided to give Pan Asian a try... and im sooo glad i did.\n\ni ordered the green curry, and the pad thai... and they were both amazing!\nthe flavors were spot on! and i wanted to scarf it all up, but it was a lot of food!\n\nwas happy to meet lisa who was very friendly, and made me feel welcomed. barbara the hostess/server was also very friendly. we chatted while my order was being cooked up. Learned that they used a lot of fresh organic ingredients, chicken, veggies, and dairy...which is a good thing!\n\ni will be back for sure!"
2,"On the up-side, the ambiance was very neat, and the staff were friendly and helpful. On the down-side, dine-in water cups smelled a bit like dish rag, and the food wasn't impressive.\n\nCoke on tap, with Pibb rather than Dr Pepper.\n\nOne of us ordered a chicken bowl, which was bland, and not even as good as a dish we used to order from Applebee's years ago; the other ordered a charred (but seemingly still precooked) kahuna burger, which was sloppy and slipping apart, the flavors and textures didn't blend as well as they could, and it left a small longing for the Hawaiian burger from Fat Boy.\n\nIt was all OK, but just OK, not even \""A-OK\"" as Yelp says. I noticed that a Braddah's is going in soon on the other side of the parking lot; it'll be interesting to see how that battle goes."
2,The first time I had to come here the experience was great. I had a great nurse and a great doctor. This last time I didn't even want to stay to get my results. The nurse made me feel like she was judging me the whole time and was just down right rude. I made an appointment for a pregnancy test and she made me feel like I was a horrible person. This is my primary doctor... Sorry I in convinced you!
3,"This is the one of the only restaurants we go to that my kids like and at which I also feel satisfied eating.  My five and seven year olds love it here.\n\nThe burgers are very tasty with a lot of variety.  But more importantly they also offer salads and other good healthy alternatives like vegetarian and turkey burgers.  And they taste good!  You can also get fruit salad instead of fries.\n\nIt is a clean, attractive place with what appears to be a full bar (though I haven't partaken of the alcohol here myself.)\n\nMy daughter loves the dancing robin that appears here periodically.  You don't find a dancing robin just anywhere."
1,"I always seem to get placed on the complete opposite end of the airport, when making connections, and have less than 40 minutes to get where I need to go.  As usual, the moving walkways aren't working either.  Places to charge you device?  Nope.  You'd think with the volume of flights CLT has, they would be better prepared, but I guess not."
0,"We were celebrating a joint Bachlor and Bachlorette party. Had a cabana, bought a bottle and few large buckets of beer. My husband went to cool of in the shower because he dared not to wet his face in the pool, upon his return from the shower my husband and a woman security guard approached me. To make a long story short they accused him of selling and using illegal narcatoics, which is outrageous because my husband does not use or sell narcatoics. Encore Beach's gm also got involved. We offered them to search us, drug test him, call the police etc etc. All they could say is they had a eyewitness (BS!) and told us it was private property and that we had to leave. The GM Ryan Jones and his security treated us horribly and made false accusations. We have never been so offended and humiliated! Plus our bottle wasn't even close to being done. I wrote a complaint letter and received a phone call the next day apologizing for Ryan and his security's action and was told they would investigate it. I have to receive a update but when I do or if I do I will update my review. So if you would like to throw your money down the drain and get treated like scum then encore beach is for you."
0,"This is the Ricketts' family (Chi Cubs owners) newest venture.  Perhaps rolled out to help pay the salary of their new prez Theo Epstein? I initially thought this restaurant had a cool concept - build your own hot dog. they offer bison of which the family has their own ranch & they also peddle at Wrigley. \n\nUnfortunately, the restaurant is not well thought out & is poorly executed. \n\nThere are a number of specialty dogs and sandwiches as well.  I went with the Italian Stallion - an Italian sausage assembly.  After my man drowned the sandwich w marina....this sandwich never had a chance.  The bun essentially disintegrated & for my $8 I ended up with an inedible mess that one could never pass off as a sandwich.\n\nI passed on their fries & tater tot looking things as they looked stone cold and unappetizing.\n\nAnother one of their specialties dogs is a Chicago dog ($6).  Simple enough - right?  Although theirs comes w kecthup.  A Chicago family serving a Chicago dog w ketchup?  Chicago dogs are never, ever served w ketchup. Never. Ever.\n\nSorry Ricketts family but you struck out on this one.  Hopefully, Theo has better success."
0,"we went there the other night and we were going from the drive through, first they got our order wrong, instead of substituting my fries with chillies they added an extra chilli to my order. when i told them they got my order wrong, the manager on the inside rolled his eyes and was bitching to the employee cause he needs to void the transaction now... while i can hear the conversation clearly... while we were waiting for the employee to fix our order the manager ran out side to help the car behind us in order to \""help\"" the service time... but by doing so his ass was right infront of my face because he was talking to the employees through the window... and he did not say sorry or acknowledge us being there by his not so sexy ass... i just left without getting my food... never have i felt so disrespected by a manager that was so unprofessional and rude by sticking his ass by my car window in front of my ass... i wish i could leave a negative star review for this place!"
4,"Came here on a Friday morning - we literally sat outside waiting for 11 am to hit so we could run inside. We intentionally came to this location so we can see how the new Komex is doing before heading out of town. \n\nWhat I'm happy to see is how much bigger the seating area of this Komex is. I always felt a little claustrophobic in the main one. There are still complimentary chips w/ salsa & guac, and the cute orange at the end of your meal. These are both awesome, and I hope they stay forever. \n\nThe real testament was the Chicken Bulgogi Enchiladas ($7.50) - they were as fantastic, if not even better (!) than I've always remembered. :-) Big pieces of perfectly grilled dark meat, a ton of gooey cheese, and the mild sauce that lets me jazz it up with the 4 sauces they put on each table. The service is still friendly and awesome. \n\nReally wish we had Komex out in CA, I'd probably eat there everyday. Keep expanding, please! :-)"
4,"My favorite place for breakfast just about anywhere. Get an omelet (you can't go wrong with any of them), pumpkin bread, and potatoes. I moved away 2 years ago and I STILL crave Omelet House."
2,"What happened? \n\nOn a much delayed return visit, I found Barioja to be sorely wanting in comparison to my last visit. We came in with a Groupon. My mother had been dying to try the gambas once more, the last time was a delicious memory of giant grilled prawns - this time, very much shrunken versions of the same dish. Patatas aioli - blatantly reheated and somewhat tasteless. I felt the menu had shrunk as well, and the options on offer much more limited than before. \n\nFinally, service was seriously lacklustre. The voucher we had was for 5 dishes and 2 glasses of wine - when we got the bill, turned out we were charged for two glasses out of the 6 we were due as part of the offer. It took a long time to resolve, and a lot of patience to explain that 4+2 really did equal six. It will take me some time to be persuaded to return - disappointing food that grew more and more disappointing as we ate; and even more disappointing service. Perhaps touched with a bit of the groupons; but it's sign enough that I can put money in other restaurants, elsewhere."
0,"It was my first time boarding my dogs of 6yrs. I was very nervous and saw that they have great reviews but I was unsure. The staff seemed very pleasant.  I came to drop my dogs off and asked to see where they would be kept. I was met with a  bit of hesitation despite it being an option.. They took me back through the \""Bahamas' room which they said to put them in, I was very uncomfortable walking through, dogs looked dirty and were going crazy. It had the feel and appeal of a humane society. They thankfully took me through to a quieter room \""Maui\"" and put them in a kennel run, that was indoor/outdoor. I left them their dog pillow and uncomfortably left.\n  \nWhen I returned to pick them up, the lady called in back and requested them picked up from Bahama's! I hope not!  When my dogs came out they were dirty and smelled horrible. The dog pillow was filthy and stunk I almost wanted to throw it in the dumpster (I wish I had during the car ride ). When I put them in the car,  my boyfriend and I gagged automatically. We had to pull over because the smell was so bad I thought I was going to puke.  :(  I washed the dogs and the pillow cover asap, but it took some scrubbing to get the grime off. \n\nI do not know what went on but I am horrified by this.  I look back on the reviews and they are mostly about the Veterinary side. My  mistake!\nI WILL NEVER TAKE THEM HERE, and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!"
3,The best Chili releno ever!  We will be back!
0,"Dr. Luoung  placed a crown on me which became infected and incredibly painful. He then did a root canal and  drilled through the new crown he had just put on, and then said that he would replace the crown since he basically destroyed it. I went back a little later for a cleaning and he did not mention replacing the crown he drilled through. Then the crown collapsed. I went to him and said that the crown collapsed. He said that I needed to make an appointment before this happened !!! He refused to replace the now destroyed crown, because it now needed an implant. I should have sued him for this but for some reason I felt it wasn't worth the time and cost, and just decided to go somewhere else and have it taken care of, at great expense anyway. It had to be extracted ,($400.00) and an implant put in. ($2400.00) He didn't live up to his word and refused to fix his shoddy work that caused the infection in the first place!!!  I wouldn't go to this guy if it was free. Horrible dentist who is only concerned about saving a buck, even if he is responsible for the screw up  !!! Look elsewhere."
2,"We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu. \n\nThe tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright. \n\nWe had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some people's 1-2 were super spicy and other's 4-5 weren't that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest) \n\nAlso, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot."
3,A great cali-mex type of joint. Exactly like Roberto's but better service. Always a great tasting meal with a smile. Reminds me of a local hole in the wall place after catching some tasty waves.
1,"I'm not sure why this place has such high reviews.  I guess people are more enamored by the experience than the actual food.  \n\nThe decor is pretty cool; it's definitely much more interesting than the average 24 hour diner.  There's a photographer who goes around and takes pictures. But seriously, I'm not coming here for the decor at 3am; I'm coming because I need some food after a night out.  \n\nThe food is extremely mediocre; I'd even say that it's below average in quality.  The portions are large however, but who cares how much you get when you can't eat something because it just doesn't taste good?\n\nI understand that this place isn't gourmet, but I definitely expect food that's at least on par with the average diner.  I'd rather go to Mickey D's to eat than this place."
2,"I had a Groupon for this location, so my husband and I tried it out. I wasn't too impressed. The service was great, but I wasn't really into the loud pop music vibe. The sushi itself was good, but nothing special. And I felt like it was overpriced. I did like the Korean BBQ sushi roll with the extra BBQ meat on the side, but if I'm craving Korean BBQ I'd just go to a Korean restaurant. I also got the \""I like my a**\"" roll as I'd read about it here on Yelp, but again I just wasn't impressed. It was good, but not as good as other specialty rolls I've had. And I couldn't find a smoked salmon-cream cheese roll (one of my favorites) on the menu. Overall, I guess it just didn't compare to my favorite sushi restaurants."
3,"I love walking into a restaurant and being enticed by the aroma of good food.  We had a light dinner. Hummus and pitas. Gyros. Hypocrites salad. Followed by a desert that I can't even begin to pronounce. Everything was very good, and I loved the normal portion sizes.  \n\nOur waiter was superior.  Attentive, yet not too.  I'd love service like this everywhere."
3,"one word: Soba. \n\nI don't eat Thai often but the last time I went to a Thai joint and asked for my dish to be really spicy, it was hardly that. At Sea, I ordered the soba noodles with beef and asked for it to come as spicy as possible and that's exactly what I got! I was so pleased.  Usually restaurants' version of spicy is pretty watered down but I left here with my lips burning 30 mins later! I love to feel the burn, ergo, I'm in love with this place. It was an orgiastic experience for my taste buds. The Thai iced tea was good as well as whatever my beau had. No time for dessert :'( \n\nAlso, there was a guy there, the owner or manager (I'm unsure), that was very attentive and polite while I waited for my beau to arrive. The ambience is pleasant and seductive, dim lighting and interesting Thai inspired decor. I really hope I have time to come here again when I return to Vegas."
2,"I'm not the biggest IHOP fan but each week after our weekly meeting someone picks a restaurant and this week they wanted IHOP. There was 10 of us in our party for dinner.  Our servers name was Denise got everyone's drink orders and took our dinner orders.\n\nDenise seemed to disappear for long periods of time instead of being attentive to our beverage refills. All  in all I guess her service was OK. If the place was busy I would be more forgiving but it wasn't. All in all Denise was very sweet and friendly.\n\nOn a good note I ordered the Tilapia Florentine ( two delicately seasoned tilapia filets, resting on a bed of spinach tossed in creamy Alfredo sauce and served with creamy mashed potatoes) I asked for a vegetable instead of the mashed potatoes). When my dish arrived I did not see the menu said my Tilapia came in a  Alfredo sauce. I asked what the sauce was and Denise told me ad asked \""Why didn't I want the Alfredo sauce  \"" I replied I didn't see it was in a sauce\"", She asked if I'd like it without the sauce and brought me a new Tilapia dish with no problems or attitude. \n\nWhat can I say? It's IHOP. Need I say more? Everyone else in my group enjoyed their meals. Sometimes you are in the mood for IHOP like food we were. Our expectations were met and IHOP didn't disappoint us.\n\nFOOD: I don't expect much from these types of restaurants so it's a hard to let me down when I eat there. The food is OK nothing special but It hit the spot. SERVICE: We liked the service that was given to us. The restaurant accommodated our party of  10 no problem.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive and efficient. CONCLUSION: The food was  good, typical IHOP food. No complaints on that at all. You get exactly what you expect. IHOP is IHOP, Its laid back, casual dining. The experience is better when you're with friends. The menu is the same everywhere. RETURN FACTOR: 100%]\n\n************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \n4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. \n3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. \n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT"
4,Marcos the guy! I had received 3 or 4 quotes and everyone said the door had to be replaced since the parts for Amarr Stratford 1000 are not being manufactured anymore. The lowest quote was for $660 to replace 4 panels. Marcos straightened the damaged lower panel and installed a strengthening strut all in 90 minutes and for less than $300. Works fine and we're relieved and happy and satisfied!
1,"It's really just a wannabe Hooters or Tilted Kilt, but without any respectable food or service.\n\nService was slow the whole time.  The place was nearly empty and they had plenty of waitresses, but everything took forever anyways.\n\nThe menu is small and boring.  Burgers and sandwiches...and not even a lot of choices for burgers and sandwiches.\n\nI had a bbq burger which was okay.  Overcooked a little bit.  The fries it came with were nice thick steak fries though.  I love steak fries.  The thing is....you can get a similar burger and fries down the road at red robin for cheaper and with better service.  Sure, Red Robin has screaming kids and less pretty waitresses, but it's still a better experience I think."
1,"This is now called the Kilderkin - the outside facade is painted a dingy black.  We'd been here once before and quite enjoyed it, including a wide selection of board games, though the surroundings are a bit grim. We had the house real ale, which was not bad. This time, we recognised none of the real ales and asked to sample the one they recommended. We were told this wasn't possible, apparently because the hand pump delivers a minimum amount which is too large. Disappointing, and we won't be going back."
3,Fun ice skating for adults.  Love the firepits and alcoholic hot drinks.  Better for hanging out than skating since the rink is so small.  Only advice is get there by 8pm to avoid long lines for skates because  supplies are limited.  Last time people had to wait for skaters to return their skates because the supplies were so low.
4,"Guarantee you will leave with a full and happy tummy. Not only is the good great, the customer service here is amazing. Can't beat their complementary bean dip and salsa! Food is always fresh and never disappointing. Fajitas are always a good choice and when you order the fresh guac, they'll prepare it at your table! It's like dinner and a show! Will definitely be back whenever I'm in town!"
3,"Did a sake tasting here, learned alot, and enjoyed the bar service.  The best tofu I have had.  Although a veggie, I'm not a huge tofu fan, but will most definitely go back for the tofu.  Only downfall, NO SUSHI!  Argh!  Still loved the tofu!  Table service had a lot to be desired..."
3,The line looked pretty long when we first come but the food was prepared quite quickly. I would definitely recommend the cannonballs and hawaiian bbq! They taste amazing!! The other sandwiches taste pretty good too. I would say you can't go wrong ordering any kind of sandwiches here. The wraps are not that great though. That's why I give this place a four star.
0,"We had a 45 min wait which was no big deal.  We hung around for a while listened to the girl with the heavy accent yell out people name at the top of her lungs for a while. It got pretty comical to after a while when not a single person could figure out who she was calling and they would all run up.  Once we were called and made our way in our server took her sweet time getting to us.  The first thing we noticed is the place is nothing like the NY Serendipity.  The decor isn't the least bit whimsical or special in anyway.  It's just another restaurant in a box, certainly not what we expected after going to NY so many times.  The menu is the same and we have already selected our favorites and where ready to go only to get a menu that differed from the one original posted outside.  We modified our choices and moved on.  When she returned she then informed us that they no longer had neither of the selections we have made where available.   So to recap to this point we have waited 45 min, had the menu change, and now are being told they don't have what is on the new menu.  We asked what else what not available and were told it depended on what you wanted to order.  We had no become so annoyed by the cold demeanor of the staff we left.  Hopefully others have better experiences they we did."
4,"The Poisoned Pen would be a gem even if there were bookstores on every corner. In addition to having their own press with some really wonderful writers, and in addition to having a full wall of signed first editions to browse & buy (wow!), and in addition to hosting more author signing events than I've ever seen before, what really separates them (for me) from any/every other bookstore I've ever visited is the staff and owners who treat customers almost like family. It was fun to be a first-time visitor to the Poisoned Pen, and even more fun to return again. And again. And again. They are what all bookstores should aspire to be. THANK YOU POISONED PEN!"
2,"Reviews are all over the scale for this demi-Italian joint, but my experience here puts it on my Mediocre List.\n\nRemember Leftover Night as a kid?  \nYou'd ask your mom what's for dinner and she'd open the fridge and say, \""Whatever you want -- we have spaghetti, salad, bread, there's a piece of fish, and some kind of meat.  Go to town.\""\n\nBuca is kind of like that.  \n\nThe selection and portion sizes available to you are just wierd.  Plain and simple, I like getting what I want, not choosing from among the things that THEY want me to have.  I know all places have their menu's, but any illusion of getting something the way you want it is gone at Buca.\nThat makes me change my mind.  Buca is more like \""Leftover Night\"" at a friend's house, choosing from among that other mom's dishes, which while familiar to you, were prepared in a way that just \""isn't like my mom makes it\"".\n\nThe food is pretty good: hovering around average, but hearty.\n\nThe service is the standard fake-friendly.  I can't be sure if the extra touch of douchebag that our server exhibited was a personal trait or something they train.\n\nThe restaurant itself is oh so very annoying, with enough distracting wall decorations to paralyze a hard ADD case.  The layout is a bunch of ridiculous rooms, with doorways and stairways like a maze, and they march you through the kitchen to get to your seats -- an obnoxious bit of pretention that should be saved for an establishment that deserves it."
1,What can I say except it's a sandwich.  Nice if you are in the middle of nowhere kinda like an oasis.
2,"my love & hate with walmart is always gonna be there;\n\n1. going down an aisle and need to look for an associate to help you but yet can't find one.\n2. you find an associate to help you but they don't work in that department!!! wtf!!! \n3. you finally find an associate that works that department but they don't know what there talking about!! wtf!!! \n3. walmart is all about quantity of items rather than the quality of there products. \n4. never buy the furniture, they don't last.\n5. produce is not great, always bruise, picked at by another customer.\n6.  but the lines are always ridiculous because for some reason there is only one cashier. how is that possible and the next person that comes waits till there is only two people in line left!!! ugh! stupid customer service i say!! \n\nlastly: they can save your a little bit of money but the quality is lacking!!!"
3,Very good pizza and salads.  Will definitely be back!
2,"I love Free People. However, this Vegas location (in the Fashion Show Mall on the Strip) isn't particularly one of my favorites. \n\nIt's a bit tiny, and the sale section is very, very tiny ( actually, it's down to one rolling clothing rack!). \n\nI don't know why, but it's always HOT at this location. I am instantly burning as soon as I walk in. Also - it's weirdly quiet in here way too often. Why don't more people stop by this store? It makes me sad D: \n\nI always stop in this place whenever I'm in town, but never get to buy anything. It frustrates me because I would love to find something I want here! Unfortunately, they don't have anything unique - everything they display is something I've seen at two or more other Free People locations. \n\nHowever, this won't stop me from popping in and checking it out - just in case (;"
0,"After a night of watching rugby at a local bar, we head to Paris, for some zzzs.\n\nDeep into the night........\n\nHubs: \""Baby, this place has bed bugs, I have just been bit!\""\n\nGame over."
1,"Meh, I've experienced much better...\n\nWe used to frequent this Star Bucks a lot until Press Coffee opened near by.  We wanted to top off a great evening with a nice cup of Joe and Press Coffee was closed at 7pm and it was 7:30pm, oh no.... so we stopped by Star Bucks.\n\nThe service started off as a standard Star Bucks, quick to greet, though missing the smile this time, and ready to make what ever caffeinated concoction your craving for.\n\nCoffee #1 ~ decaf and sugar free vanilla syrup. Barista stated, \""we are out to decaf, would regular coffee be ok?\"" What??  No, we would like a decaf please.  Barista, \""that will take 10 mins, so you will need to wait\"".  We asked, why are you out of decaf? Barista, \""we stop making decaf earlier in the day\"". We did not want to wait so we opted for a leaded brew.\n\nCoffee #2 ~ regular coffee with sugar free caramel.  I watched the Barista and noticed she used the white pump for the sugar free vanilla and the brown pump for the sugar free caramel. Star Bucks used one collar for sugar free and the other for sugared syrups.  As she poured our coffee I asked her to please make sure she gave us sugar free and not sugar. I noticed you used both colored pumps.  Barista, snippy ~ \""we don't separate our flavorings like the other Star Bucks\"". She then dumped our coffee's out and using the same cups proceeded to use the same pumps again...  \n\nSo we got both coffee's and proceeded to the cream bar and there was no cream...  So I asked a different barista for some cream.  She stated, \""here ya go\"" and placed a gallon carton of cream on the bar and walked off.\n\nWowsers!  The coffee tasted burned as though it had been sitting there a while and we were for sure if we were drinking sugar free.  No sugar comma later so we are ok and don't plan to go back to this Star Bucks for a while..."
4,This is our go-to place when we want to spoil ourselves.  The bread and pesto if phenomenal!  The lobster ravioli is divine.  And we love the lemoncello at the end with the yummy biscotti.  The wait staff is very attentive.  You WANT to go here!
0,"This place was a nightmare for me. I understand that there are people that love love love to do weird shit like hit the stores at 5am the day after Thanksgiving to do their x-mas shopping, punch other people in the face and threaten their lives for that \""last fucking furby\"", and shop at Last Chance.... I'm just not one of them. \n\nI'm not saying I'm better than you....... oh, who am I kidding, yes I am."
4,"The first time I went to Sushi Ave, probably over a year ago now, the food was decent but the service, while polite, was very slow. Today, though, things are much different. First of all, the food has gone from decent to flippin' AWESOME! Can you say flavor? You might get bigger pieces of fish at other places, but the sushi here is excellently chilled (warm raw sushi freaks me out a little) and full of flavor. Unlike many sushi places in the Mesa area, they really have an excellent flavor to their rice, so you end up enjoying it rather than viewing it as filler to go with your fish. \n\nAnd that is as far as the food goes. THe service here has improved greatly, too - plus, the staff are super friendly, so if things do get a little slow, all you have to do is flag the waitress down and check on your order. That doesn't happen often, though - no more than the average business. The decor of the place has also improved - so, yeah, that might be a little silly, but the ambience of a place does make a great difference. My first time there, it was just green walls, black tables, no frills, nothing. And if you went into the bathroom, you were blinded by this hiddeous flourescent orange color that blinded you. Bathroom has been redone, they have adorable lanterns and parisols up on the walls overall, a great little place.\n\nMy only word of caution is that the place honestly isn't that big. They do have a large table they set up and separate from the room with a screen if you have a bigger group, but if you have more than eight people.... it might be a tad crowded. This place is slighly on the cozy side. Not bad , though.\n\nGo for the Chirashi bowl!! it's delicious!! As are the Hawaiian roll and the volcano!"
0,"No stars for me where did all the good employee's go out of no where .. sorry you guys lost a loyal customer. Rude, manger took forever to help me with my concerns. Dont even know her name, someone needs to take this store over or bring back the old workers."
3,I love their popusas! They are just a bit on the expensive side $2.30 each. Their Chicken Salad is also very good.
3,"Winner-Winner - Chicken Dinner\n\nI won!   All I can say is that the casino was nice and clean.    The people were friendly.\n\nI played some blackjack and won big so all i can say is \""Woohoo!\""\n\nI will be back - I found a chip I have to cashin :-)"
1,"If you like when bartenders add in additional tips on top of your already generous one, then this is the place for you!  I live in Scottsdale and have been coming to Firehouse since it opened.  DJ is fun and the dancing is cool when you're drunk enough, but don't let it fool you!  They WILL add in extra money on your card and sometimes will straight up say they dont have your card anymore. This has happened to us 9-10+ times, and apparently we never learn our lesson.  \n\nExhibit A: Email from my husband after visiting Sunday 06/30\n\""Firehouse put like an $8 dollar tip on $10!!!! I tipped $2. I kept two\n of my three receipts and the one I didn't keep is the one where they\n added the tip. They should be investigated. I know they added it\n because the pending amount was $9 something and the posted amount is\n $19.25\""\n\nIf you just can't help yourself, and have to go in there...pay in cash!  But seriously, there's plenty of better places that will value your business and won't be greedy yahoos that nickel and dime you.  Go somewhere else!!"
2,For a sandwich this place isn't bad but nothing to rave over. I may have ordered the wrong thing but I wasn't way impressed. I felt like I was eating a normal turkey sandwich that my mom made. There were other items that looked good and so I would give it another try!
3,"These are some great tacos.  They will deep fry anything, which is my favorite.   Their salsa verde is spicier than most, but I couldn't get enough of it.  Check it out if you're by.  Make sure to meet the owners if they are there, they're hilarious!"
4,"YES!!!!  Mama catered my wedding and it was perfect.  If you want to die and go to heaven, order the penne ala vodka or the pollo CarcCiofFi.  It can get crowded, but if you want a fun meal - sit at the pizza oven and watch the pizza maker do her (or his) stuff!  Can't say enough good things, my mouth is watering already.  Great for any special occasion or just a night out."
0,Will never rent from this place again. Rented car in Las Vegas to drive to Flagstaff AZ in my spouses name. Get to Flagstaff and my husband has a medical emergency and has to have heart surgery. When calling Thrifty to put my name on car so that I can drive it back they refuse. Tell me my only option is to have car towed back!!! I ask to speak to a manager and they say he will call me back and no call returned. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY AND I AM A LICENSED DRIVER. There has to be better options than this!!!
0,Wow I wanted to try this place and as soon as I walked in I literally saw a rat run right across the open kitchen. I couldn't believe my eyes. The waitress saw it too and pretended she didn't see anything!! I walked out and couldn't believe what just took place
1,"What the hell happened here in the past 6 months. This was my favorite buffet in Vegas since it opened. I came here this past weekend expecting the best but instead got shortchanged. I asked for their 24 hour AYCE buffet pass. It went up $20 to $70. Really? I expected the quality of food to have increased as much as the prices. Over half of the food I got was so SALTY, I couldn't eat it. If you have heart disease or diabetes, run for the exit. Ridiculously salty. It was 6:30pm on Friday when we walked in. This place was empty. Should've recognized this red flag. \n\nCame back for breakfast the next day. Same thing. My favorite corned beef hash to the hash browns were saturated with salt. Who runs the kitchen now? They should rename their buffet \""Salt Market Buffet.\""  Time to find me a new buffet in town...Any recommendations?"
1,Came here for my husband's high school reunion and the atmosphere was okay but the bartenders were so RUDE!!! I stood at the bar for about 5 minutes and watched the two of them just ignore me....then when one of them finally came over to get my drink order she acted as if I was bothering her! Oh I'm sorry I thought you were working! Here's a thought if you don't actually want to deal with people then don't get a job dealing with people!!! Thank goodness we live here and didn't actually have to get a room here and deal with he rudeness!!! I can only imagine! I was super hungry but they closed the restaurant down to cater to the reunion and serve finger foods but the problem with that is I could never find the host/hostess with a full tray!!! Well ended up leaving early to grab food elsewhere! \n\nWord of advice: clean up the nasty attitude because the people that actually spends money contributes to your paycheck.
1,Nice vibe to it but the food is just bland. Had spinach Alfredo pizza that lacked much taste. Very disappointed
2,"Nestled among a line of independent bookstores, you'll find Andrew Pringle.  Focusing more on the older or antiquated books this is the bookshop for those who like books that appear to have a reasonable degree of history behind them - I love these types of books (each one of them feels as if they have their own story).\n\nFor those to whom this is of interest there are a few first edition books here, but to me personally these aren't worth the extra money - I couldn't care less if they were first or last off the press.  That said, the books here are worth looking through especially with so many neighbouring bookshops."
0,Horrible! Can't get an order right. Dirty. And who the hell puts black olives and red onion on chicken parm? Steer clear. Bunch of idiots. Never going back. Chicken sucks anyway.
3,"I finally decided to stop by this unassuming, petite, yet charming Italian joint for a quick lunch.  What impressed me the most about their pizza was how the crust was thin, soft, and airy.  I typically look for a gooooood crust and Pino's did not disappoint.  I might in fact enjoy the crust more than the toppings themselves.  \n\nI thought the sauce tasted fresh and light while the cheese and pepperoni maintained that greasy consistency that you see at a lot of places.\n\nDo not let the outside appearance of Pino's fool you as the interior decor makes up a lot for the limited parking space and simple exterior design.  As someone who has seen it all, from Paris to New York, I very much appreciated the essence of Italian art being incorporated into the walls that surround the contemporary dining room.  What I liked especially were the exposed, red bricks near the ordering counter, the fancy column structures and classy lighting that made you feel you were dining at a ritzy ristorante! \n\nBeing that it was my first time here, I will definitely venture to more items on the menu such as their panini and pasta entr\u00e9es.  I have a feeling they will be just as pleasing as what I had today.  The best part was paying under $7 [1 Topping Slice + Bag of Chips + 1 Lg Drink].\n\nSo for the simplicity in taste and quality with a touch of Italian culture, Pino's has made it into my lunch rotation."
0,They lost my clothes and charged me for stuff I never sent.\n\nClearly they do not know what they are doing and need to get their act together!!
4,The sushi quality is really good! Depending on when you go it can be a bit busy but they are normally very quick with getting you in. The service is good and quick and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good sushi place!
3,The new updated rooms are a lot nicer and comfy compared to the older ones they had awhile back. It more modern and sleek and the smell that use to reek has disappeared. On top of that they have one dollar bowling games at night along with some great drink specials perfect for large or small gatherings with friends and family.
4,"The best chorizo and eggs I've ever had! I go with my family every time I'm in the area. The waitresses are very friendly and the service is excellent. If you're looking for a delicious, home cooked meal, make sure you try this place out! Make sure you get a cookie, they're the best! Especially the snicker doodles!"
4,"Yum!\nThe food is great!  My family and I ordered all different meals and loved it all....lamb shwarma, chicken kabob, luleh kabob, tzatziki, hummus, tabbouleh, garlic sauce...everything fresh. The pita is amazing.\nI got it to go, but while waiting had a nice conversation with Papa. \nReminds me of the great Mediterranean restaurants back home in Glendale, CA."
3,"I just went for the first time last night.  I normally eat real healthy but I felt like having a cheat day and like a man I was craving meat.  The question was posed by my girlfriend, was this worth the cheat?  The answer is sort of.  We split a double burger and an order of fries.  We still couldn't finish the fries because the order was huge.  The burger was nicely cooked and the fries were perfectly crispy on the outside.  I did enjoy their house sauce as well.  However, this was a great big grease ball.  Yes I was in a burger shop but I wasn't expecting that much.  Lastly, the service was speedy and the food came out nice and hot.  I gave bonus points on cleanliness as well."
2,"Very nice place if your looking for a out of the way and off strip hotel. Owned by wyndham, formally efairfield, they offer lots of activities BEST suited for young children, They often have parties in their pool area and play movies on a projection screen. They even have food served. Pool is always crammed with little kids. I even got threatened by a little girl because i bumped into her. Jeez! Overall, you best have a car if your staying here, it is off strip and if you walk, intend to walk alot. Overall, its a nice place."
2,"So after a little time spent in the pool, we went up to our room, showered and had to decide what we wanted to eat. I have Subway all the time and was in the mood for something else. My girlfriend, her cousin and I went with Fatburger. They both got burgers, I was feeling chicken so I got myself a spicy chicken sandwich and got some fat fries for a side.\n\nAfter having my chicken sandwich, I was wishing I had the burger. It was your standard chicken sandwich. Not spicy, more peppery. The only heat it had was in it's temperature. The chicken was steamy inside the outside crispy layer. Took a little bit of time before I could eat it without burning my mouth.  It was a tasty chicken sandwich, but the burgers looked so much better.\n\nI have had Fatburger in the past, but it's at least 8 years since my last one. Maybe I'll grab one on another night. I'll be staying in the Fiesta for the next week."
2,"Munchies is okay, but it doesn't hold a candle to Yogurtland, IMHO.  On my last visit I couldn't find a flavor that I liked.  Vanilla tasted the best of all of them, and that never happens!  A lot of the flavors taste very artificial.  The friends I go there with, though, always pick up a couple of pre-packed quarts to take home, so I guess I'm in the minority.  I'm not a toppings person, except for an occasional little squirt of fudge, so I can't judge or compare those.\n\nBut Menchies is much closer to my house, and I love that they support the community, so I will continue to patronize them."
0,Great bartenders.   Tight machines.  Players benefits going downhill.  Must leave all VIP dinner food at restaurant.  No take home on leftovers.  VIP dinners aren't so VIP.  Non VIP customers treated better.  Shrimp dinners are a joke.
0,"If I could give this place no stars, I would. We placed an order online under the impression that we were paying $60 for 4 rolls. What we got instead was 16 pieces. DON'T BUY FROM THEM. They will rip you off. When we called to complain, the manager, Dave, was rude, unsympathetic that their website was misleading, and tried to blame the delivery company for making the order wrong. Talk about misplaced blame and unaccountability. Horrible business and even worse customer service."
0,"My family and I moved away from here last July 2013.  We enjoyed living here until the summer came.  We lived upstairs directly above one of the lakes.  When the weather started warming up the lake smelled really bad.  \nWorse than that is the circumstance surrounding my move out.  My husband had already left out of state for his new job so it became a very hectic time trying to complete a move with my children and 118 degree temperatures.  I had placed my wedding set on my bathroom counter while I was finishing loading our stuff, my hands were swollen from the heat.  I made a dreaded mistake and left it there when we moved.  I called up the office as soon as the they were open (about 4 hours after I left) and informed them of this.  They said they would go check and see.  \nThe manager sent her maintenance worker by himself to go search for my expensive diamond set.  Of course he came back and said it wasn't there.  LIAR!!!!\nI am furious that they would have sent one employee by himself to go retrieve such an important item left behind.  \nShe should have gone herself and brought a witness.  This has been heartbreaking.  I feel like and idiot for leaving it,however, I was exhausted and way overheated.  Shame on them for their lack of compassion and care, and shame on the maintenance guy for stealing it and saying it wasn't where I know it was."
2,Delicious food would definitely come again just for the food but very slow service.  When my Husband and I sat down we waited 10-15 minutes to even get a menu and once we were ready to order took forever for someone to come over to. Other then that was great.
0,"Had to leave at 5am to get to the airport. Booked with green cab the night before. They didn't show and when I called, they said they didn't have my reservation. Clearly they have problems with their reservation system, since I'm not the only one this happened to. Unfortunately, when it is at a crazy early hour and you're on a tight deadline, this throws a massive wrench into things. I will never use Green cab again because of this. \n\nThe other times I used them before this I had fine, but not great, experiences. Now I prefer badger cab or union cab."
0,"Great stadium to watch a game. Went to camp to see practice, ordered a hot dog which took almost 15 minutes! What would happen if there were 60,000 people? The concessions are the worst I have experienced - MICHAEL BIDWELL listen to your fans, big fix needed"
0,So disappointed!! The wings there are now BREADED! I'm from NY originally and wings are not supposed to be breaded. I really hope they change back to how they used to be or I will not be going there again. Extremely upset!
4,"In las Vegas as well as other big restaurant/entertainment towns, good food is expected but in Las Vegas it sometimes does not fully compare to Chicago and NY.\n\nHowever, the one place I finally went to was Samba Sushi and what a great surprise.  I tend to avoid sushi in several places when traveling unless in Hawaii and some parts of CA and Japan.  Sushi Samba had some of the best dishes I have had and the quality was great.  They have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.  They do some traditional sushi but mostly more interesting variations as well as the S American dishes.  Some of the items were:\nRock fish\nWagyu Gyoza\nRock shrimp tempura\nGreen bean tempura\nPork belly\nMoqueca Mista. Seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion\nYamato sushi roll(maguro, Fois gras, Osetra caviar)\nUni shushi outstanding \nGreat sake list\n\nAll the fish and shellfish were fresh and well prepared.\n\nIt gets busy so we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there.  Luna and Maria can help with picking some great dishes at the bar.\n\nIt is on the higher price side but worth it compared to a lot of other places where the food doesn't always live up to the expectations in Vegas.  Looking forward to next trip back there."
4,"This place was amazing in Texas and is just as amazing in Las Vegas.  I am SO SAD this is the only one in the ENTIRE valley -- where is the South Vegas love, guys?!\n\nYes, I have made the drive JUST to eat at this place.  And that's almost an hour.  I would drive further if need be.  Sadly, because of said drive, I can't go here as often as I like... but maybe that's better because I'd be super-broke.\n\nEvery single visit I have made here (about a handful?) has been epic.  The servers we have gotten each time are extremely awesome, helpful, and always have crazy great personalities.  They seem to genuinely love their job.  Wow!\n\nThe food is just as good as it was in Texas.  Scratch that... GREAT.  Guacamole Live is a staple of my OTB ordering.  I cannot visit here and NOT order it, even if I end up ordering other things.  Margaritas?  Awesome and HUGE (and taste like they get extra shots in 'em...whee!), the beans are awesome (and I'm not crazy about beans), their homemade chips are GREAT (ask for a to-go bag of them -- you can reheat them to their cooked perfection with the special bags!) and pretty much anything else I have ordered is stellar.  Carne asada tacos, queso, quesadillas, you name it -- they rock it.\n\nI wish I could teleport here at will -- then I would give it 6 stars.  -;)"
1,"***Ciao Ciao's gelato is pretty good but also very overpriced (even for Las Vegas)***\n\nCiao Ciao is a gelato bar inside The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They have a good number of flavors and many of them appeared to be creative concoctions with lots of ingredients mixed in.  I went with the pistachio and the mascarpone with caramel and both flavors were good.  The gelato was creamy too.\n\nService was quick and pleasant.\n\nPricing was very high.  I ordered a medium size and it was $8 before taxes.  While I did not get the gelato at the more famous Jean Philippe in Aria, I think the gelato there was about the same price (maybe even less at Jean Philippe).\n\nCiao Ciao's gelato was a satisfying frozen dessert.  Pricing was too high though.  Pricing is high for a lot of stuff in Vegas, but I think for the prices you will pay here, you should be able to find more interesting and more well known sweets elsewhere.\n\nThe Forum Shops and Caesars offer complimentary parking (via valet or self parking structure)."
3,Love Chakra 4! We have been spoiled by previous staff that were there for years! Unfortunately they are no longer there. The owner and I actually attended sister schools. I only wish the store had more space its hard to take everything in when there's not much room and everyone is stepping on each other. We are excited to check out the new store in Ahwatukee! Super blessed to have this available and recommend to everyone to try natural remedies and herbs for anything YOU could imagine!
3,had a maple bacon bar for lunch and I am a fan...will be back to try other flavors...
4,"Hot damn! This place is great!\n\nI've been to rodizio spots where all you get is meats, unlimited salad... and fries or rice with your meal. Bleh. Here, you have access to a plethora of other foods. Cheeses, salads, soups, sides, sushi; pretty much an entire buffet on its own s'all there. The staff was quite accommodating (we ate A LOT) and even brought out a free dessert for a birthday at the table (the dessert is HUGE too). Obviously the main player here is the meats and they do a great job with them. Some are bacon wrapped, crusted, stuffed or just plain ol beef, but regardless of preparations, they're all tender and filled with flavor. Even the sausage and ribs had an excellent smokey bite. Seriously, come here if you need a food coma. They give you a card so your server knows whether to fill your plate with the latest offering and I think our entire table had it turned to green for a good 90 min straight. Good times. Can't wait for round 2... (in 2015 when I'm not so full anymore). \n\nBonus: Saw Flavor Flav in the houuussseee."
3,"Went here for my cousins 21st birthday, it was difficult to find but once you saw the bald head of Max Brenner, you knew you were at the right place. I didn't expect them to have so much selection for a notorious chocolate place when I read the menu.\n\nThey actually have two, one that is more formal, with a simple list of salads, pastas, burgers/sandwiches, sides and appetizers. Pretty normal for a restaurant. The one that caught my eye was the Kobe Beef Burger, I decided to go with it since it costs about an extra $2.\n\nWhen I got the burger, I was impressed with the display. It's not your average plate, you get served with a wooden style pallet with this 8+ inch steel rod in the middle of the burger. It was quite huge and definitely did not make me feel bad for spending $16 on a burger. The sides were a waffle style french fries and came with a unique sauce on the side, which I put on the burger and fries. \n\nI was also impressed with their style of bowls/cups, when my seatmates ordered their pasta, it was something I've never seen at a restaurant before. It reminded me of the seat Will Smith sat in for his interview in Men In Black. I wanted one. In fact, when I have my own place, it is a goal of mine to have these obnoxious bowls that wouldn't be good for cereals or soup, but great for pastas and stir fry!\n\nWhen I bit into the burger, I was one happy camper. The thing was huge and I decided to use a fork and knife just so I don't ruin it. I felt like, it was not your average burger, might as well eat it like it wasn't a normal burger.\n\nThe atmosphere was alright, for a large group that we had (about 11 people), it was pretty decent. Kind of hard for the booth side, in case someone needed to hit up the restroom (which is located upstairs). Also, the music was played very loud, kind of like a club but it wasn't club music.. It was like, lounge or jazz... At one point they played a beat where I felt like I was in a jungle or something! Our server was nice, she had to handle a lot with a big group. I am sure I would have gotten a better experience with that if it was maybe 4-5 at most. Then again, you know what your expecting with a big group. Whats your order? Next.\n\nSadly, I didn't get a chance to have dessert as my buddies wanted to go back to the hotel and party. And I don't know if chocolate and alcohol would mix well, I mean.. It really depends what your drinking. I KNOW... Dessert is why you go there but again, the Kobe burger got to me and I my hunger was definitely satisfied. I'm also trying to watch my diet... So the burger was more than enough. Originally, I was going to go for the turkey burger/sandwich but I said, \""what the hell, I'm already here and... I've never had a Kobe beef burger... Might as well go big or go home!\""\n\nAnyways, I would go here again. Definitely for a big date night, special occasion or if I was in the area and decided to spend at least $20-30 on myself for lunch/dinner."
1,"We booked three rooms and none of them were ready until way past 4PM. This is the first hotel that checks in after 4PM! What kind of Mickey Mouse operation is this?\n\nWell, I'll have to say the room was superb. That's about it. We stayed on Thursday New Year's eve until Jan 3rd. No one came by to clean our room on Friday or Saturday even after we called and complained. Did we mention that we saw a bunch of cleaning ladies shooting the breeze while \""cleaning\"" a room? When we left the room 2 hours later, they were still in the same spot! Very diligent workers they have here!\n\nIn any case, we finally went to the manager to complain on Saturday morning at 10AM. He promised us that we will get it cleaned within the hour. By the time we came back at 4PM, it still wasn't clean! That's when the proverbial shizz hits the fan.\n\nThey finally cleaned our room on the last night we stayed there after enough bitchin' and moanin'. They also removed the resort charges (fees for what?) and our Internet fees. But it's little too late, we already have had enough. We will never ever stay at another Westgate resort again. These guys don't know how to run a hotel business at all, but they are sure good at scamming people for timeshares. \n\nSpeaking of timeshares, if anyone got suckered into one, you may as well shoot yourself in the head. Why would you you pay them thousands of dollars for the privilege of \""renting\"" the hotel out for one or two weeks out of the year, and you don't even get New Year's weekend? You also get the privilege of paying a \""maintenance fee\"" (AKA hotel rental fee, AKA sucker's fee) for a room you don't actually own. We paid the maintenance fee (AKA hotel rental) to rent the hotel over the New Year's holidays and we didn't even have to buy a timeshare. Not only that, but we will never ever come back here again."
2,"This hotel confused me a bit...  I chose this place over others because I love the casino.  The decor and overall scene is great, the place has been kept up relatively well.\n\nFirst off, we pulled up to the valet and there was no one working, I stopped my car got out and walked around looking for someone to take my car.  I looked around and couldn't find anyone so I figured screw it, I'll self park, it's not far.  As we drove out of the valet area there was at least 40 people waiting for their cars.\n\nWe park and walk to registration.  There wasn't a large line by any means, maybe 6 people in front of us and 4 employees working the counter.  It took almost 30 minutes to make our way to the counter, once there the room reserved was no longer available so the guy upgraded us.  We originally reserved a Park Ave room which is just above the standard room, the clerk told us he put us in the Broadway room which was a level up from that.  All was fine and dandy until we got to our 'room?'.  Ever been on an Indian reservation?  Well me either until I got to my room.  The indian theme was pretty tacky but the purple pleather chair with tiger stipe seat cushion really pushed made it incredible awful.  The room was big enough for an after party but I mean even Motel 6's have coffee makers in the rooms...\n\nI can say for a room that runs $400 for a Friday and Saturday it's definitely, DEFINITELY not worth it.  We got a good rate, that's the only thing I can say I came away with from this stay."
4,Great place for Pizza and Wings and everyone there takes care of us all the time. \nAnd I want to thank them for the job they always do for us..
3,"Cheap. Fast. Hearty. I am not a fan of the meal 'breakfast', but my brother and father love this place. You get so much food, for such a resonable price. Their breakfast burritos are amazing. You can mix and match any of their fillings. I like mine with cheddar, sausage, avacado, mushrooms and green chiles. Yummy!  The pancakes and biscuits and gravy are HUGE. Like I am not kidding, this place will fill you up & keep you full for 10 days. If you can finish an entire meal, you should win an award. Seriously."
0,"On a recent trip to Phoenix, my husband and I decided to stop by Durant's to try out their steak.  From what I heard and read, we had to try Durant's at least once during our trip. \n\nOverall, we were pretty disappointed.  The only saving grace for this place is the decor which makes you feel like you walked into an old style restaurant in Hollywood. \n\nThe place was packed and crowded which is nice to see but the food was average at best.  My husband ordered the Cajun steak, which was their special for the night but it was extremely salty.  I had to dunk the meat in water to wash off the excess salt in order to swallow down the steak. \n\nThe prime rib I ordered was over cooked. \n\nThe garlic bread that everyone is referring to is terrible.  It's just french bread dunked in a bowl of olive oil with some garlic shavings on top.  Nothing special there.    \n\nThe sauteed mushrooms we ordered as a side was also extremely salty. \n\nDo they even taste their food before serving it to people?  \n\nIf you're visiting Phoenix, skip this place because it's definitely not worth it.  We wasted a meal by coming here."
4,"Jeff and I drove to Basis last night, July 5th.  Our most recent attempt was a Sunday night and we were greeted by a notice that said they would not be opening Sundays in the summer. Total bummer. Last night we found the parking lot empty and the space completely bare of any fixtures or signs of restaurant life. Alas, Basis is closed. \n\nOwner Steve Short wrote a thoughtful piece regarding the decision and its available here:  http://www.atlastacatering.com/Basis_New_American.html\n\nWe are so sad to see them go; it was for us, a place of welcome and frequently celebration. Delightful food and wine in an atmosphere that was completely down to earth and as Steve says, unpretentious."
3,"I dined here for lunch last week with my wife during one of the few days there was sun out.  As I have frequently dined at the Mon Ami Gabi in Bethesda, Maryland, I pretty much knew what to expect - good food and service. (unlike my experience at Les Halle in Washington DC, where I had excellent food and an asshole for a waiter)  I can easily say that Mon Ami did not disappoint.\n\nAfter about a 20 minute wait, we were sat outside.  Immediately, fresh bread was brought to our table and our drink and food orders were placed (when in France, order Kronenbourg).  Our food arrived promptly. I had the mushroom quiche which I thoroughly enjoyed an my wife had the chicken and gruyere cheese crepe, which was tasty as well.   \n\nThe restaurant is also across the street from the Bellagio, so we were treated to two fountain shows (one of which was Frank Sinatra...it doesn't get better than that). \n\nIn all, a great place to enjoy an outdoor lunch on a nice, sunny day."
3,"We've been here before when it was so crowded and overly noisy and just made for a disastrous dining experience. We've also been here when the other diners have been more reserved and understood how to use their inside-voices. Definitely, I prefer the latter; definitely. \n\nHana is a good value for the cost of dinner. One can bring in one's own wine, beer or sake which is a terrific deal. I've taken in a flask full of sake, warmed up in my lap, for sake bombers and didn't get any funny looks. The fish is fresh (or at least we've been fortunate enough to not have any freshness issues) and brought out in a timely manner. \n\nI understand we missed their 2-year anniversary. Bummer. I am happy to see they made it past this threshold. Maybe I'll see you there tonight?"
4,This place was great! I was looking for a new place and when my sis suggested we get a pedi I was all for it and found this place on Yelp. Always leery of new places but this place was awesome! Very clean and everything is new. Got a pedicure and was pleasantly surprised with the shoulder rub that came while my nails were drying. Will definitely be coming back and telling friends.
4,"The patio was my favorite. Such a relaxing atmosphere. Service was great, my server was friendly and attentive. \nOrdered The Margherita and it was so delicious. \nHad the chocolate cake for dessert and the vanilla bean ice cream. Everything was so perfect. Definitely coming back! :)"
4,"I love this store. I always feel like a queen when I shop here. Today, after purchasing my new FENDI bag, I told the sales lady I was going to the perfume counter next, she asked what I wanted and ran over to get it for me. I jokingly mentioned these were my Christmas gifts to myself, After I paid, she offered me a claim check and told me when I was finished with my shopping to pick up my packages from customer service. When I picked them up, they had been wrapped so beautifully complete with a gorgeous silver NM keychain.  I only wish the cafe were open later as a strawberry popover would have been delicious while shopping..."
0,"I know I've been away for awhile, and that you all have been waiting with great anticipation for this update...\n\nI can now say officially, after FINALLY receiving all our furniture, this place deserves one star (if that).  Just a note; we also have been buying furniture from a place that is going out of business (Furniture Marketplace on Westinghouse Blvd.).  How can we be recieving stellar service, from sales point to delivery, from a place that is going out of business, when this newly opened store who presumably is trying to build a book of clients can't deliver a furniture order until a month and a half after promised delivery?\n\nPass on this one...with all the great furniture shops in town and in west north carolina, why put up with this stuff?"
4,"REALLY Good! It's so good, it makes good look not so good! I can honestly admit that this place was the second best pizza joint I've been to in my life (the first being some random italian mom and pops in NY that I forgot the name of). \n\nThe spinach pizza was extremely tasty, the sauce and the cheese went hand in hand without overpowering the spinach. The calzone was very enjoyable. I haven't had one before, so I went ahead and decided to try it at a place that had good pizza, and the spaghetti calzone was a great compliment to the entrees. This was also the first place I've been to aside from Taps that actually has Blue Moon on tap, which is very cool."
1,"\""Monstrous Portion\"" was what the menu said about the prime rib beef dip sandwich.  The sandwich was NOT but the price WAS. Meat to bun ratio was 25% meat to 75% bread and the meat was fatty. Generally speaking it was overpriced. My chicken sandwich was tasty with fresh mushrooms sauteed & swiss cheese,  bread nicely toasted but again skimpy meat to bread. Our server was friendly and attentive. Her recommendation for the wings blackened was excellent and we enjoyed them.\nI didn't appreciate the idea that karaoke started before the baseball game ended and informed the server we'd need our bill before singing started. We didn't get an itemized receipt and left feeling ripped off. Our bad for not requesting the itemized receipt but this place doesn't live up to it's own hype. 2.5 stars because the wings were very good, it was clean and our service was good."
4,"I have loved Potbelly's since I found them in Chicago years ago! The best sandwich shop around, especially with all the choices in the area.  I think they pack quite a punch of flavor at a reasonable price. However, I'm heartbroken they took away the potato salad, even though the flavor had changed some since my visit in Chicago. The manager of the store is super awesome with a great crew. Bottom line- Do it!"
3,I'm not a huge fan of NY-style pizza usually but I must say that I'm impressed with Luigi's.  The crust was thin but had a good bite to it.  The cheeses / sauce ratio was just right and the toppings were seasoned well and was plentiful.\n\nThe slices are pretty big.  I would say 1 - 2 slices should be plenty of most people.
3,"Usually associate Tapas Bar for Spanish cuisine, so decided to try to Forte on there version for European flare. After sampling Mixed Spanish Olives, Garlic Truffle Fries, Adjarski Khachapurri Siberian Mixed Grill plate, Thracian Clay Pot.  And for dessert had Baklava (Georgian Style) and Tirimasu (Georgian Style).\n\nFood was very flavorful and the decor/atmosphere....definitively deserves a second visit."
2,"This will be a mixed review.\n\nFirst, let me say that the transformation from Cork to Earnest appears to be successful. I don't know if it's the \""new\"" factor, but the place was really hopping tonight, a Friday.\n\nLongtime regulars of Cork, we were excited to try Earnest. \n\nOn the disappointing side is happy hour. No food is happy hour priced. Nothing. Not even gimmicky dollar off select appetizers. Also the happy drink selection is very limited, with just one cocktail, a gin-based Aviation, ordered twice and served two different styles.\n\nWe ordered \""The Board,\"" with feta cheese and chicken pate for $13, but felt the bread ratio to food wasn't balanced. We asked the bartender for another single piece of bread. They brought out a plate of bread and we were charged for a side of toast. sigh.\n\nWith dessert -- the banana pie -- we also ordered an expensive cappuccino ($5.50) that was marred by bad milk. It curdled in the cup. It was replaced, but made us question quality control.\n\nWe spent a C note, including gratuity, without ordering an entree, but left less than satisfied. With such limited happy hour specials, I don't see us going back on any kind of regular basis. Hopefully Earnest will make adjustment as they learn from their first inning experiences."
2,"We came here for dinner twice on our trip since it was right in our hotel.  The first time the food and the service were amazing - if based solely on that experience this would've been a 5 star review - but the second time we came in the service was awful and the food was just as bad - so if based on that this would be a 1 star review!\n\nThe first trip - the staff were great and always around.  They were quick and everything came out right.  The fried mac & cheese comes out in an amazing beer batter - these were the best I've ever had.  The bbq burger I had was massive and cooked just right.  They have some of the best french fries.  The guest I was with had the chili burger without the bread - good thing there was no way you could pick that up and eat it!  2 burgers,  2 regular drinks and an app for just over $30 not bad at all!\n\nThe second trip - it was later in the night and they weren't crazy busy but we waited over 20 minutes even though there were some open tables.  Then we waited quite some time for our waitress.  We gave our order and waited - the mac & cheese was just as good.  The burgers however were bad... I asked for mine medium well (should have been just past pink) - it was like a hockey puck.  My guest asked for hers medium and got one just past medium well.  We couldn't catch our waitress for over 10 minutes after our meals came out at which point there was no way we were waiting for them recook them.  They did make this right and take one of them off our bill... but at this point the dinner was ruined.\n\nThey do take off $1-$2 off each item if you have a total rewards card.  This place is extremely loud at night due to the live music and dancing - it is a bar after all so don't expect less.  I have also been in here on crazy nights when bras are hanging from the bar - so I wouldn't recommend bringing kids in here at night!"
2,"Was drug in here against my will last Thursday! I will admit the place looks awesome at night. Unfortunately, there was a photo shoot going on (for Maxim Mag) and the douche factor was unusually high. I'll come back on a weeknight or day-drinking on a weekend and see if my attitude improves.\n\nI hear this is the ultimate for day-drinking and people watching."
3,"The new Discovery Children's Museum was great!\n\nIt is a new $55M establishment near Charleston Outlet mall. There are too many things to go over, but your little one should be able to burn at least 2-3hrs+ in here!\n\nWe really liked the Water World area :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lied-discovery-childrens-museum-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#kaS0mJmbB2-jrPHAPXNlwA\n\nWhich had lots of fun stuff like water cannons, dams and waterways, and just fun in the water! They give us cool little vests to keep us \""mostly\"" dry lol.  Lots of cool stuff to explore, just keep an eye on your camera in here :)\n\nWe also had lots of fun in the 70ft tower! There are tons of little places and activities hiding in each and every nook. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lied-discovery-childrens-museum-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#yCHvVWK1uBl-aDQtasD-2A\n\nLots of imagination here!  My little guy liked exploring so much...every turn had something new to enjoy.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lied-discovery-childrens-museum-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#t-9a2L-cYERl74Ks1ROHoA\n\nOverall, this is a great place to spend some family time. At $12pp (incl kids), it is not cheap, but not expensive either! You can buy yearly passes for the whole family for a little over $100!"
3,"Once you walk in the Forum Shops you can see the detail that was put in the place.  \nThe escalators alone are an attraction in itself.\n\nAlthough you can't \""splurge\"" here as much as you can, unless you've musterd up to save up thousands of dollars, if you're a fashionista, it's always nice to be around the nicest and finer things in life.\n\nIt's so nice and clean, even the restrooms.  It's a must stop shop in LV"
0,"\""AY. F'ING. CARAMBA. How can a dealer get 21 so many times!!!\"" Those were my exact thoughts about 4 shoes into the $5 black jack table at O'Sheas. Right around the time when I was reevaluating why I ever stepped foot into this tiny, cramped, stuffy joint instead of seeking out a giant alcoholic beverage.\n\nI know this sounds riidiculous but I swear the black jack here is rigged! 4-5 shoes and NO ONE at the completely full table was hitting any ounce of a winning streak. The dealer was hitting black jack, 21, and 20 like nobody's business. I swear it's something with that automatic shuffling device they got goin' on there! I'm on to you O'Sheas!\n\nAfter losing about 2 years of my life in extra-stuffy second hand smoke, and one very crappy daquiri later, I decided enough was enough and left this place about 40 bucks in the hole. Yeah, not a big deal but this experience seriously sucked. I never missed my hotel's beautiful and well ventilated casino so much until I gambled here. UGH. It gets one star for the legit band that was playing, that's it!"
1,"Been here 3 times and very disappointed.  Other than the ambience the food and service have been inconsistent at best....Tried everything popular on the reviews, (Nachos, Brisket, Pork Belly Sandwich, Mac and Cheese) and my experiences have been exactly opposite.  Terribly inconsistent, greasy, and just super disappointed as a live 2 blocks away.  My waiter told me the owner makes their moonshine at his house.  C'mon, really?  Bad luck or an off night....3 times I don't think so.  \n\nMy guess with all the reviews is that people have already made up their mind before coming here.  I have wasted too much money giving this neighborhood spot another chance.  If you want REAL BBQ in North Phoenix go to Pork on a Fork.\n\nOh yeah.......the owner parks his white Range Rover in the handicapped spot in the front......nice touch"
1,"Very underwhelming and not worth the money. Only positive was the cool drinks. However, service was awful. It took 25 minutes to get our first drink after we ordered. A couple if us had the corn cakes-nothing special. Others got the wings, again nothing special. I had the green chili Mac and cheese-again, nothing special. Everything lacked real flavor and that mixed with the poor service made it a bad experience. Won't be back and do not recommend."
4,"Jin Jin restaurant highly recommend, not that big, but the food are really good. We ordered orange chicken,Sichuan beef and seafood delight,which are all really good! Right choice to come!:)"
3,"This review is for the one in terminal C closest to the security checkpoint, I believe near gate 24.  This morning I was in need of a jolt, 7:30am flight back home and I was already hot.  I went with a large iced latte and this was served up quick and strong just how I love my coffee!  Kudos for the Sonic style ice, loved it."
2,"I noticed the business sign when I was in the area a while back.\n\nI had no idea this was a full-blown restaurant with salads, pizza, pita's, etc.  A large restaurant with tables - high and low.  A bar.  I went at lunch at it was packed but I found a place at the bar.\n\nThe menu has quite a few items of interest.  Since it was lunch - I just got a gyro.\n\nThe gyro was rather plain and un-inviting - not that good.\n\nI'd like to return and try some other things.\n\nService was excellent,"
3,"So I dunno if you've ever been in a situation where you're really hungry and you're thinkin, 'Do I want a Burger, or do I feel like a hot bowl of Noodles?'  So typical..... I've been there on numerous occasions and let me tell you, I could ponder that fork in the road for hours...if only there was a place that served both..... Tadaaaa!\n\nWell, it's not exactly one place, more like two places adjacent to each other by chef/owner Lorin Watada; whose fusion burger fame, 'Bachi Burger' has propelled her into Ramen game - the current 'it' food in Vegas.  Not that there can be enough Japanese fare in my opinion!Jaku Niku, Kyo Shoku (The Weak are Meat, The Strong Eat) Shoku Ramen-ya \n\nI have to say, there's like, a Ramen explosion going on in Vegas, it's getting a little over saturated  with all the Ramen joints popping up...not that I'm complaining.  Some of the places here taste better than the one's in Japan!  (no kidding) \n\nWell being right next door to Bachi, it's a culinary Sophie's Choice, what am I willing to let go; could I possible eat a Burger with Fries right after a bowl of Ramen and Gyoza?  If only they could deliver next door, that would be the best of both worlds right in one sitting. I mean, how many calories could that be...4,000?  What's that, 7 hours on the Starimaster? No prob!\n\nShoku Ramenya is relatively small, just under thirty seats, but feels pretty open and spacious for a noodle shop.  I'm particularly enamored with the set of condiments at the table as well as the jug of water that they provide for you as you're seated, refilled often throughout the meal.  And the iced Green tea is also refill friendly, all little plusses that add up in the end. \n\n\nPork Gyoza\n\nAlways start off with a plate of Gyoza, it's like a cultural tradition of Ramen Shops to provide these half dozen, moon shaped crispy delights stuck together like little piglets.  It's always a little game to try and pick them off without ripping the skin, retaining the piping hot filling within its crackling confines.  As for the pork, I enjoyed the strong hit of Garlic, but it felt to me as if the meat slightly overcooked; it had a harder texture without that juicy component that one would expect when you bite into Gyoza.\n\n\nLobster Miso Ramen\n\nSomewhat of of an offbeat item, the Lobster Miso Ramen has Butter Sake poached Lobster pieces along with the usual Ramen suspects: Chasu Pork Slices, Buttered Corn, Kikurage (Wood Ear Mushrooms), Menma (Mabmboo Shoots), Nori (Seaweed) and Kaiware (Daikon Sprouts).  The broth is made from the gooey, brown, Crustacean brain sludge (hence, Lobster Miso) that delivers a predominantly briny, sea/ocean soup that if that's your thing, it will drive you insanely happy!\n\nI was bouncing off the walls, it tasted so good! And you get the best of both, there's three Chasu pieces resting on top, although they looked more like thick-cut Pork Belly slices to me. Minor details...  Usually the portions are overgenerous, where I'm hurting to finish the bowl, not the case here, in fact I was left wanting a little more Ramen noodles to go with all the toppings.\n\nAs for dessert, I was tempted by something cold after all that hot broth, And Ice Cream seemed like a good idea. I'm terrible fond of Black Sesame, as it seems to be a reoccurring ingredient in many Japanese desserts.  Assured of it's moderate portion, what came out was a pint of Ice Cream, which could only be considered one scoop if its contents came out of a ten gallon vat from a factory...  I should have know better, but I'm slightly disappointed every time I order a Japanese dessert, it's relatively mild with lukewarm sweetness.. underwhelming.\n\nBut a palate cleanser was definitely needed after all the oils in the broth and this kinda worked..\n\n\nSo, now it come down to the Battle: who won?\n\nFor Appetizers:  I don't know, they both so different!!\nFor Main:          I can't choose - they're both sooo good!!!\nFor Dessert:      Bleah.....\n\nThere really is no battle, if you feel like having Burgers, ie. red meat, got to Bachi.  If you cold and need to warm up with a great bowl of Ramen with some great Broth, get yourself on over to Shoku Ramen Ya.  I love both of these places and it's always hard to decide each time I'm in front of these two doors!\n\nShoku Ramen Ya\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)                                   \nAmbience:  4\nService:      4.5"
1,"With all the H&M hype, I thought the place was Eh...Ok. The styles are very European (especially the horrific shoes). For basics sweaters, leggings, shirts - they were inexpensive and a good place to go. The parking and lighting in the store were not good or helpful. Also, the staff was rather cold, unhelpful, and snobby. Give it a try - but be warned that it's a lot of hype without the stars to back it up."
0,"Worst location ever! I just moved around the corner from this particular TB and am very unsatisfied with the service. The people are relatively nice but the speed of service sucks. It always takes at least 15 minutes to get your food in the drive thru and it is usually ice cold once I drive the 3 minutes to my house.\n\n(edited below 4/23/13)\nThe other issue I have i that every time I have visited this location, they get my order wrong. Not just a little wrong, completely wrong. Today the store manager came to try and help the incompetent employee mess up my order. I decided it was time to speak up, She never said sorry, acted offended that I was giving her negative feedback about her store, and proceeded to talk down and mock my concern.  I was so upset that I banged on the window and demanded my money back. I drove 15 minuted to the next closest TB. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"
3,"I LOVE MY NEW BIKE! And I have Evans Cycles to thank for it. As Claire C mentions, it is a chain and whilst I am definitely all about supporting local sometimes you have to concede that chains have bigger stock and supply. I had already been to two other bike shops in Edinburgh, both independents, and hadn't found *my* bike. None just felt right.\n\nBut even on a Sunday, when the stock was low at Evans, they had the perfect bike for me. A sexy little number, in red, hybrid with two sets of gears and a white seat and a little bell. The customer service was really good, they let me test the bike no bother, and when we pushed them to have the alts done by 2.30pm (with only an hour of work-time) as we were pushed for time, the guy hurried it through for us.\n\nAdmittedly some of the stock is really quite expensive compared to other places. So I held off buying my bag and padlock from here. But for the bike itself, Evans have a great range and good customer service to go. No rushing, no pushing onto one bike or another (I was torn between a hybrid and a road bike). Although newbies be warned (as I am a newbie) - most bike shops like to keep the seat higher than you might need as it's good for the legs and you can get more push and it's general better bike-riding But as a noob I need my seat low, lower, noooo lower. So don't be afraid to keep asking them to adjust it till it's the perfect fit for you.\n\nTHere's also a free check-over the bike in 6 weeks time, and they run a 'how to care for your bike' class once a month. Very happy Jen *ding ding*"
2,"My boyfriend believes this place has the best pho around, and he rants about their spring rolls. I must admit it is all pretty good. That being said I don't care how good the food is when the service is so bad. I don't expect anything over the top when it comes to a vietnamese restaurant, but I do expect to not feel uncomfortable. It seems like a bother to ask for anything (like your water to be refilled). \n\nThe moment I can convince my boyfriend someone else's rolls are as good I hope we never have to come back."
4,"I visited Crave for the first time tonight, and I have to say that it was a wonderful experience. The service and promptness was impeccable. Hayley was our waitress and she did a fantastic job, always making sure we were taken care of."
4,"LGBTQ was the best BLT ever. If you like real coffee you've got to go here. \nThey have great food, coffee, smoothies and lots of other things. Worth a visit. I'll be going back soon."
3,"Got the gyro time sandwich with lamb n beef shwarma, tender tasty meat, good tzaziki sauce, haven't had a gyro in years, this one holds up to most, but one time at band camp..... Oops\nNext time gonna gnosh on the falafel (is that the spelling)? \nFree drink refills, u get fries w the combo for 3bux more....\n\nGyro you later!\n\nCali"
1,"Honestly, would have walked to the food court around the corner, but seeing as how I predicted I'd be at the food court later in the AMs.....I chose to go with the \""healthier/better/guiltless\"" option.\n\nHad the Roasted Turkey. Good. Nothing to rave about. Put me in walking vicinity of Earl's and I'd go there 100%."
2,Always love a good Chicago Dog and Luke's is a cool place to scarf down a couple. This location has been here for a long time and you can tell. The outside is a bit weathered with a very small eating area inside.\n\nBeen coming here on and off since I moved out here. The menu has the typical Chicago favorites with the service and attitude that make you feel right at home. Giggles! \n\nUsually order one of the famous Chi-Dogs or maybe an Italian Beef with both sweet and hot peppers. The french fries here are your typical frozen crinkle cut kind and nothing special. Wish they had handcut. They are so much tastier and can be found in other Chi-town hole in the wall places around town.\n\nThere are so many new Chicago restaurants in the PHX area now and some of them big chains. Luke's has lost their edge over the years. The quality of the food and the service is not as good as it was in the past and the prices keep going up. Maybe I'm just getting spoiled in my old age.\n\nEveryone has a different opinion of this place and the only way to find out is to give them a try. The parking lot is somewhat limited and a bit tricky at times. This place can definitely get really busy during peak eating hours. So get ready for a bunch of impatiant hungry people. ORDER UP!\n\n3 STARS
4,Simply the best tacos I have ever had!! \n\nI ordered the fire grilled salmon tacos it comes with rice and beans. The tortillas were fresh and made right there.
4,"I have been going to Marina for the past 10 years. She recently joined this salon and has been very happy here. There are several highly skilled stylists at Vision. Sonny gives an amazing haircut, Jorge is wonderful as well. Marina does my color and has always been consistent. I have really long hair so it's hard to not fry the hair by coloring it. She mixes a different solution for my roots and one for the rest of my hair. She also gives a great blow out (which seems to be hard to find in Vegas.)"
2,Go here very frequently as it is very convenient to go to for my business. It is right across the street. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Only draw back is that they have no self check-out lanes. Sometimes their lines are long and takes a while to check out.
4,"I go here often to either get gel manicures or acrylics and I have not once had a bad experience! The staff who have done my nails have been patient and helpful as well as friendly from my experience. I enjoy that they have a tv in the back of the salon to keep you entertained while you get your nails done. The only thing is they seem slightly expensive to me, for a manicure with gels its $40 and same with pedi and  polish. Then again I don't know rates for other salons so this may be reasonable. I don't have anything bad to say besides the first time I got acrylics there they gave me flares which I didn't like, but I didn't know the difference."
0,"This Place is disgusting! It's infested with tiny little ants running wild through the tables as the cleanliness of the restaurant was lacking. The food is bland, it's been reheated 6-7 times. Food is cheap along with the quality. It was hard to leave upset with owners good hearted kindness. \n\nNever AGAIN!"
1,"If you are interested in a variety of greasy food in an \""ok\"" setting for an \""ok\"" price then this is your place. Looks pretty run down. A variety of choices, but none that looked all that fresh... felt sick when I left. Two stars because my husband loves it."
1,"Not as I expected...Dinner buffet for $21.99?  Totally not worth it.\n\nThe food quality is average and below but they charge you like a buffet in Vegas.  \n\nThe Sushi are pre-made and setting on the tray, not fresh made per order.  Very limited choice.  The sashimi are thinly slice and taste not fresh too.  When ask for a sashimi, the guy give you a pile of sashimi and put them on your plate, no presentation or anything..(there you go...eat it!!)  \n\nThe Oysters, some fresh some not.  Few of those are sitting on the ice under the light for a long time, I have some of those and they are warm, not fresh!\n\nSalad and fruit bar, I believe the pineapple from the can, and the oranges are from one of the backyard, so sour.    \n\nThe soup choice are Hot and Sour soup, Egg drop soup and miso soup...very basic and you could find them in any Chinese buffet for $5.99 AYCE.  $21.99, I expect better quality of soup.  Hot and Sour soup, not hot not sour.  Very disappointed.  \n\nThe clams, almost every each one of them have sands in it.  After a couple of those clams, I don't even want to try it. \n\nThe mongolian grill (the noodle, cook per order).  The food choice are very limited.\n\nThe BBQ ribs, too dry!\n\nThe other food are average, you could find it in any Chinese buffet for half price or under $10 bucks! \n\nThis restaurant 1-2 stars the most.  I won't recommend other to try this place, even with a coupon...don't waste your money.  \n\nI would recommend go to Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet, same buffet style, food are better, more choices, taste better, fresh sushi (made per order), and lower price ($15.99), I vote that for 4 stars at least."
2,"I flew in from Baltimore MD and the flight arrived two hours early, which was a very cool way to wake up from a airplane seat coma. There was nothing that really jumped out and made me want to spend hours here or anything that left an impression that was \""wow' At the same time, there was nothing bad about it aside from some lack of signage concerning the basics. All in all walk in, check in, sit, relax, takeoff (you hoser) and arrive someplace not as sunny.\n\n\n\n\""The Good\""\n- The fact that the Phoenix Airport logo is the same as the Rebel alliance from Star Wars... at least it did when a sleepy eyed Scotch-Irishman stumbled off of a place after just waking up.\n- A Starbucks located in what seemed like every terminal and the main hub. A smart marketing strategy.\n- Fairly wide aisles. There are some airports that even if you have twenty feet to either side someone will find a way to walk in front of you and stop in your path... here you do not really have to worry about that.\n\n\n\""The Meh\""\n- Nothing really meh to comment on.\n\n\n\""The Bad\""\n- The baggage claim area was a little confusing. I like signs and not having to ask where things are when they should be pretty clear."
3,"I've been both excited to try and scared to try BLT Steak based on the wide variety of reviews and overall average of a 3.5 star rating.  This weekends stay at the Ritz-Carlton proved the right time to take a plunge as we knew the weather was going to be a bit windy/chilly so it made sense to make a reservation here vs. venturing out.\n\nFirst things first.  We both enjoyed our meal immensely and there were just a couple things that knock that 5th star off.  Here's the meal:\n\nOur waiter brought a small container of some chicken liver pate and a couple toasts as a complimentary starter.  It had a great, somewhat spicy flavor and was a nice way to begin.  They also bring you very yummy gruyere cheese popovers and our server was almost smacked by my wife when he tried to clear her last bite of it too soon!\n\nOnce it was us paying, we started with the seafood platter.  When my wife heard me order it she raised her eyebrows as she generally sees me willing to shell out bigggg bucks on those things at other high-end joints.  This version is just $35 and to me, not a bad price for what all you get.  Two each of jumbo shrimp, raw clams. One Kumamoto oyster and one Blue Point, a small dish of shrimp ceviche and half of a 1lb lobster.  It comes on ice with three delicious sauces... Mignonette, Dijonnaise, Cocktail.  It was all very fresh and very good.  Dipping the lobster in that mustard sauce was a real winner.\n\nWe each got a salad.  Her's was Bibb with a nice vinaigrette, and mine was a Caesar.  Both were like endless bowls of salad.  The more we ate, the more it seemed like there was to eat.  In other words, huge!  The Caesar came with some delicious parmesan toasts. The dressing on the Caesar was a tiny bit too sharp for my tastes but, all in all two good salads.\n\nMy wife got the small filet and I got the NY Strip.  This is where the first partial star knock off comes in that both were just a little overcooked.  Not enough to make a fuss about but still, at this price point, one should expect perfection. Beyond this however, both steaks were very flavorful and had a real nice crust on the exterior.  The Strip may sound a bit small by steakhouse standards at 14 oz but it was 99.9% pure meat.  Barely any fat or gristle remained and that is how I like a steak.  The sides were both very, very good.  Got the BBQ corn with bacon and chives and the potato gratin which had the best crunchy, cheesy, gruyere topping on it!\n\nOn the service side, things were professional and set a good balance between paying attention to our needs and paying too much attention which is always nice. The only small bobble was our server not having 100% command of the menu when a couple questions were asked.  Very minor thing but, noticeable.  \n\nAll in all, we would certainly come back here based on a holistic view of the experience.  It's pricey for sure but, that's true of all high-end steakhouses.  I'll keep The Palm as #1 in that category here in the QC but, BLT is an intriguing change of pace that I will try again."
2,"Hmmmmmm. That pretty much sums up how I felt after we left here, unsure, not entirely convinced, full and still with some coins in my purse!\n\nDamn, this place is properly student cheap. But then again what else would you expect with it being right next to the university. It ALWAYS seems busy, no matter what time or day I walk past but I can kinda see why. Big ass plates of filling, yummy noodles. Yes I probably could have quite easily made my vermicelli noodles with vegetables at home but why would I when they make them so much faster, and cheaper here!? Plus I don't have to do the washing up!? \n\nWould I eat here again, yes. I would maybe order something a bit more adventurous, although the whole mixing every kind of meat under the sun baffles me. And I want some of those salted edamame...... yum."
4,"This place is awesome!  Need a reservation weeks in advance, well worth it!  If you don't try the poutine au foie gras you are not doing yourself any favours!  It's crazy delicious.  I've also eaten the special of the day a couple times...trust this chef, he's good!!"
1,"Revisited recently - a few items to note:\n\n+ Improved seating/dining area. Looks like they remodeled the inside and it's more comfortable if you're dining in. Waiting for a to-go order? Still a bit awkward, but at least there's a half wall to divide the entrance from the dining area.\n\n- Service still a bit \""off\""; very rushed feeling. Our server sat us and before our butts hit the chair he was asking what we wanted to eat. We asked for a minute, and he returned literally within a minute to see if we were ready.\n\n- Pricey. $1.50 for a can of coke or a single cup of tea. Most entrees border $10. Most appetizers border $7. Papya salad, diet coke, and entree cost more than $20 before tip. That's steep, in my book, given the quality and quantity.\n\n+ Spice levels are perfect. Three spice will get your attention but won't overwhelm.\n\nFor the value, atmosphere, and service, you can do a lot better. Monsoon Siam destroys this place all day long."
4,"Prima Breakfast sandwich substitute for buttery croissant and add avocado might be the best breakfast sandwich of all time. Delicious. Also, their homemade hummus is good."
2,"It's definitely not the Encore or Wynn. The spa is lovely. The gym has great equipment but no bottled water. The rooms were okay but seemed dated. The whole sunken living room idea seems very 1970. Getting help from the concierge was a bit frustrating as they were at capacity. They were able to accommodate a late checkout, which was appreciated but I would not choose to stay here again as I think there are several Vegas properties that are much nicer."
0,"DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!!! I would give them a zero if I could. I actually paid for the service and it is a complete scam. They promise you that if you pay for the listing you can contact the owners directly. They don't mention that it's by mail only!! In addition, they have a prewritten letter they have for you to send to the owner is to request for a rent to own. I don't even want to own a home. The listing on Trulia was for rent. I thought that they were legitimate because I have paid for a similar service before from a different company however I actually received direct contact information. Also I assumed that since it was on Trulia then it was ok (that was my fault for assuming). I have also seen them on Zillow so be careful. I wish I would have read Yelp first. I hope this helps someone before they make the same mistake I did."
0,We go to this Cold Stone allot and have had only great things to say about it.  But I was going to stop in Saturday evening around 8:30pm for some great ice cream but to my surprise I saw a ice cream fit in progress.  Ice cream was flying everywhere and on employees as well.  There was only one smaller gal that was trying to maintain a business like atmosphere for the on looking potential customers.  She was cleaning and seemed to be trying to stop the madness.\nI would not be surprised if they just put the ice cream back in the coolers after playing with it...pretty sad.  Won't be going to this Cold Stone for awhile if ever!!
3,"This spa is beautiful and has some very nice service rooms and decor.   The entry way is very beautiful and the waiting area is spacious and clean.  THe waiting area chairs are not comfortable at all but I doubt you sit on them for longer than just a moment while waiting to be called back to the locker room.  The locker room is busy and noisy.  There  are tons of lockers and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I wasn't too impressed with the aqua area in the women's locker room.  Maybe it is too European for me but I am NOT into cold water showers or steam rooms even if they are labeled as rainforest spray.  Cold water is cold water no matter how pretty the room is or gentle the spray is.  The sauna room was nice and big.  I did enjoy that.  The steam room was too hot for my taste and I didn't last long in there.  The hot tub was pretty crowded and what is with the goofy uncomfortable banana-looking chairs that are around the hot tub.\n\nThe salt room is ok but like another reviewer said, the Atlantis salt room in Reno is much nicer.  My favorite part of the spa was the wave room.  It was so beautiful and relaxing in there that I did fall asleep.  It was warm and cozy and watching the gentle waves above you will whisk one away to lala land.  \n\nOur treatment room was nice.  We had the couples rasul mud treatment.  It was nice and I did like the muds used but, once again, the rasul treatments at the spa Atlantis in Reno is better.  There is a shower in the room that you can use after your treatment to make sure you are mud-free.  The rasul treatment room in CR does not have a shower so you hope that you get all of the mud out of the cracks and crevices when you are spraying off.  We still had lingering mud after our treatment,  \n\nThey have the cafe in there but you have to go get your own food/drinks.  It would be really nice if they could have a service where they brought the food/drinks to you.  \n\nThe other complaint that I have is that the place is too darn big.  It is crazy how many different hallways there are.  Luckily, there was a lot of staff walking around to help you find your way."
1,"I made an appointment for three of us to get a pedi. The place smells like chemicals and it doesnt seem like they have a proper ventilation system. \nThe nail polish selection is outdated and looked old.\nFinally, during the pedi, the water was cold, the woman's hands were cold and it was the most half ass pedi i have ever received; tho as most reviews indicate, it's hard to find a decent place in pgh that isn't an expensive spa.\nThe woman finished my pedi in 15 minutes and i was left sitting while my friends and other women who were seated will before us were still enjoying some foot tlc. There was no massage, which I am accustomed to and i had to tell the woman 3 times not to cut my cuticles. Im sure it is completely dependent on the person who does the pedi, but i have no desire to come back to this place."
1,"Got a Groupon deal $30 for hot stone and feet massage. When I was looking for this place, I was looking for the name it advertised which was Healthy Life Foot Spa.  The name is actually just Foot Spa. \nI never really believed in the moto, You Get What You Pay For. In this case, it was true. \n\nPros: They're open till midnight (weird but true), I get a foot massage, it was cheap, it was really for an hour.\nCons: The guy working in me was doing it to hard and felt like he was rushing, rushing to where he was breathing hard like he had some kind of asthma. I have asthma too which I understand but it was definitely a distraction! Not only that, but he burped too. He wasn't even trying to hide it. The stones he used on my back were WAAAYYY too hot, I told him but he still kept going. He didn't use any kind of lotion or oil to massage me, which felt like he was pulling my skin. I have some fat here and there and in certain spots, it felt like he was pinching me. Ouch! I got used to it.\nSo, overall I don't think I'll be going back."
2,"Was staying here, so came here for breakfast. The assortment of food available was great. You can have made to order omelettes any way you want them. They had french toast, sausage, bacon, steel cut oatmeal (really good with the nature valley bar pieces available), potatoes, pastries, smoked salmon, waffles, etc...etc... The honeydew seemed partially frozen, but they actually separated the pineapple from the other fruits (Thank God!), so kudos to them for doing that. Everything else I had was good. I was surprised that the regular price of breakfast here was ~$20 because nothing stood out as amazing, but for a free breakfast I can't complain."
1,"The minute you step into this OG, you will get the stench of smelly socks. Very hard to un-notice the smell. Service was poor, the waitress was just trying to get rid of us ASAP, even though we went in at 8PM (not too late for dinner in my opinion). The place is not clean, the table we sat was sticky.\n\nFood was in par with the other OGs. Will I go there again ? nah for the amount of money I pay I would go some place else - that at the least doesnt smell.\n\nIm giving this two stars only for the food."
0,"Horrible landlord, is always in a bad mood never shows up when she says she will. Will schedule an appointment and not show up and then will blame you when you question why she hasn't come yet. Horrible on respecting privacy will schedule maintenance before even telling you and will expect you to be fine with whatever date and time and when you need something done actually maintenance will take weeks if not months to do the job. \n\nDo not rent from these people unless you are a masochist."
0,"I signed up on yelp just to give this a place a review.  They seated us really quickly, but in a cold freakin' show room with fold out chairs and space heaters.  When the food came out they couldn't remember who ordered what and kept trying to give orders to the wrong people.  My friend didn't get his food at all, they just lost his order or something and the server didn't come around more than once after we ordered our food.  When we were finally able to flag down a waiter to tell him our friend didn't have food he was really nice about it.  But then the food didn't even come until everyone was done with their food already.  And that was only because we had to remind them AGAIN that he hadn't gotten his food yet.  AND THEN, IT WAS THE WRONG DISH!!!  We had to wait another 15 min or so before they finally brought out the right one.  The food was not very good and i wouldn't have eaten as much as I did if I wasn't starving already.  We wanted to pay the check and leave but no one would come to our table and finally the bartender from the other room came to help us.  When we finally got the check they didn't come to collect it for another 15 min!\n\nThis place was awful, I get better service at mcdonalds.  i gave the one star because the people were nice.  but they shouldn't be in customer service and the food wasn't the worst i've ever had, but it was still pretty terrible."
4,"So they pretty much have every flavor Tea imaginable hot or cold!! Had their Chocolate Mint Hot Tea, and my oh my it was Devine!  Not your typical \""tea shop\"" as it has more of a modern feel.  Not too crowded for being a Saturday night, but enough people to know its worth walking into.  Cant wait to try their pomegranate tea!"
4,"Wow, I'm now into my SEVENTH TAX YEAR of using Michael Gallacher & Co. to do my taxes since I discovered them right here on Yelp and read the glowing review by John S.  All this time their service to me has been absolutely 5 Stars too!  My filings are complicated (to me, anyway) but these super nice folks answer any questions I have along the way through the year, followed by properly and quickly doing my IRS and State of Arizona submissions each time they come due.\n\nI have dealt mostly with Michael Gallacher but once when I had some mid-year business with the IRS MIke Bosen here helped me take care of that and he was great to work with too!\n\nNow if they would just have a bowl of free chocolates sitting out in the office...\n\nWow, what's that over there?     :-))"
4,"I really like Lenny's.  They're such a nice escape from all the other chain sub restaurants, ESPECIALLY Subway, which I'm growing to detest.  This one recently went thru an ownership change but the staff is just as friendly as the original, so no worries there (or w/the quality of food).\n\nWhen you first order a \""regular\"" sub & see the bread they whip out you think, \""wow, that's nothing special\"" (in comparison to other places)...but that's before they start PILING on the meat and toppings!  The good folks at Lenny's do NOT skimp on those.  That underwhelming bread loaf very quickly becomes a heaping mass of goodness that will quench most any appetite.  I took my dad here once & he scoffed at the beginnings of his 'samich until he saw the finished product...and could barely finish it (and he can pack away some food!).  \n\nJust came home with a regular turkey on wheat (and they have excellent wheat bread btw), and it was only $6.94 w/tax.  For only about $1.50 or $2 more you can make it a meal - but I'm TRYING to be healthy so I opted for water at home (insert grimace here cuz they have really good sweet tea). Basically the same thing you'd pay at Subway for miniscule toppings on a 6\"" sandwich. \n\nLenny's reg sub is 7.5\"" and twice the size of Subway toppings-wise, and their large is twice that at FIFTEEN inches!  They also have a good selection of salads, as well as hot subs like Philly Cheesesteaks.  Oh, and they also have these \""grilled footlong hot dogs,\"" BUT BEWARE - they aren't your ordinary hot dogs, they're more like these ENORMOUS sausages & they're rather oily/greasy...not for the faint of heart (and the reason they're like five/six bucks or something like that).  \n\nSo, in short, if you're in the area of this or any of the other Lenny's, give'em a shot - you're sure to be in for a treat.  And you'll certainly be full when you leave!"
2,"My boyfriend and I ate here after reading an amazing article about it online. The food was good for a buffet but nothing more. It wasn't the worst or the best Vegas buffet I've encountered. The $20 bottles of wine were awesome, just perfect for an all you can eat buffet. If you don't finish it you can take it to go! The service was good, above average for a buffet. Worth a trip but not my absolute favorite."
3,"Good small market not too far from my house. Just what i needed,  philipino all purpose sauce for the lechon that my homies mom made for me. This store saved my life, close and convient."
1,"This seems to be indicative of the Doubletree brand in a down spiral.  The hotel is old and appears to be converted from another chain. \n\nI only stayed one night due to other hotels being sold out.  The room was spacious, but the wallpaper was peeling, the fixtures in the bathroom were heavily rusted.   To make matters worse, the heating did not work.  The walls were paper thin and every noise from inside walls was as if I was in the same room. \n\nIf you can stay somewhere else, do."
0,"Wow. What bad customer service! Not even a hello when we came in. Nobody had a smile on his or her face,  from waiter to owner/cashier. The ph was less than decent. My cousin could not finish his bowl. When we paid,  the change was thrown onto the counter instead of handing it to us."
3,"I'm surprised at how much I liked this place. It's a cut above your standard casino \""coffee shop.\"" I ordered the salmon and a caesar salad. I expected the same old overpriced junk that you get everywhere else in town. Imagine my surprise when I was served an AMAZING Caesar salad with super high quality ingredients and shaved cheese! The salmon was crazy good too. The kitchen was more than happy to make my food low carb as requested (in this case, it meant extra broccolini instead of rice). No issues and good service. The only big negative to me are the super uncomfortable director's chairs. Mine felt old and I kept worrying the canvas bottom was going to fall out from under me! That and the music was WAY too loud. I was sitting underneath a speaker but it was so loud my ears were nearly ringing. Nice location, setting and view; ask to sit by the window."
0,Ordered delivery and was not happy. The chicken was burnt so badly. Salad was forgotten. Ranch was forgotten. Zucchini was frozen in the middle.
2,"I've been here twice and the food is decent - I wouldn't seek it out, but it's not bad for a quick lunch. I really liked the sweet potato fries and that  dipping ranch sauce that comes with it. The service is OK...I kind of feel like I'm on an episode of \""Rock of Love\"" with all the bedazzled clothes and headband bandanas there, but hey, I guess that's the image they're trying to go for. \n\nIf you sit on the patio try to get a table that isn't peeling apart and God awful filthy. I nearly got splinters by grabbing by napkin off the table."
3,"We dined at Jaleo for my husband's birthday a few days ago. the first test was the wine list - being from Sonoma, the Spanish names were not familiar.  Our waitress, Kristen, was extremely helpful and suggested a great Tempranillo.  We chose several tapas plates to share, and all were so flavorful.  My favorite was the roasted cauliflower with olives and dates - a dreamy mix of savory and sweet.   Second favorite was the Espinaca - a lightly sauteed spinach dish with raisins.  We finished the meal with a beautiful flan, accompanied by a citrus (mandarin?) sorbet.  The only critique would be the noise factor - as it is a very lively and busy restaurant.  Highly recommend this place and would love to go back!"
3,"Green Pepper is a casual Korean restaurant. That being said, the food is pretty simple but yummy, and the service is decent, but not great. The price point is just about right. This place could be compared to Oishii Bento in Oakland, not to Sushi Kim. \n\nOver all, I really liked the place.  My biggest complaint about most Korean restaurants in Pittsburgh is the cheesy and shabby looking  interior. Unlike most other places, this place is very  neat, cute, and looks more like a cafe, not a traditional Korean restaurant. \n\nI had Dolsot Bibimbop (mixed rice in a stone bowl) and it was really great. Highly recommend it."
3,"One thing we were determined to win at, was having a great indian dinner on the las vegas blvd after realizing that everything else out there was only \""by-chance/luck\"".. With a palate limited to the vegetarian options, we hoped that their popular dishes -  Biryani and Bhindi masala, were worth the reviews.. Surprisingly, they were of the finest quality and taste. We couldn't have had a more enjoyable and ful\""filling\"" dinner.. A lil too conservative approach resulted in the lunch buffet next day.. Hmm.. We quickly realized that Tamba proved to be merely just another indian buffet place for lunch..\n\nDefinite stop-by for an exquisite indian dinner.. Visit them for lunch if you must have indian lunch buffet..\n\nThe review is completely based off of the vegetarian dishes.. Not sure how they fare at the non-vegetarian menu.."
1,La bouffe est plut\u00f4t bonne.\n\nPourquoi deux \u00e9toiles ?\n- Pas d'alcool.\n- Des mouches partout.
1,"Lucy!  Oh, LUCY!\n\nHow many times have I tried to like you?  How many times was I let down?  My friends think you're so great, that it just makes breaking up so hard to do.\n\nAre my expectations too high?  I don't think so.  I'm not expecting to fill the shoes of Red Apple Grill.  I been to Tony (Roma's) and (Famous) Dave's.  I've gone to Memphis (Championship). Heck, even Applebee's served up better...and was a really cheap date.\n\nMaybe you're too saucy for me, always running here and there.  Or perhaps you just lack flavor, that certain je nais se quoi.  I don't know.  I've given you so many chances to impress me and to show me what you've got, but this is the last time.  I've pretty much given up on you.\n\nGoodbye Lucy, I fare thee well."
0,"Worst cab company I have been in, in a long time ~ like ever.  Long hauled.  $10 trip ended up being $30.  Will complain to Nevada Cab Authority."
2,"The pros: The ambiance. The wine list. The appetizers. The vegetarian pizza offerings. The cool private room in front for larger groups. And did I mention the ambiance???\n\nThe so-so's: The pizza sauce. It's a preference thing, but their standard red sauce is a little off-putting in its spiciness.\n\nThe cons: It's a small place. That's not bad, but they don't accept reservations or have a bar where you can get a drink while you wait for a table. And the last two times we've been there, the hostess was pretty rude. \n\nAll in all, it's a place I'd be happy to go to at someone else's suggestion, but I probably won't be seeking it out that often on my own."
4,"Cute little sandwich place in Old Montreal.  The green pea soup was delicious (the best I've ever had) and my panini sandwich with pesto, mozzarella and tomato was very flavourful.  You can get a 1/2 sandwich with soup for $8.  Everything seems house made as well.  The staff were very sweet and I got to practise my French."
4,"I've seen Lola Coffee appear recently on one of my favorite blocks in downtown Phoenix. The day I finally set foot in there I was pleasantly surprised and am happy to say Lola Coffee was beyond what I expected, and I was expecting it to be fabulous ;) \n\nThe parking is easy to get in and out of, plus plus! There are two entry ways, one in the front and one in the back. The decor/ambiance of the coffee shop is awesomeness. It is a cluster of rustic, vintage and post modern. The people inside seemed like nice/interesting people reading their morning paper rituals over coffee. The shop is very clean, organized and \""pretty\"". \n\nThe barista and cashier were both very friendly and welcoming. Oh how I love when people making coffee have some extra enthusiasm that rubs off on me and sparks up a positive day for me :) \n\nThe coffee was FRESH. The power of fresh coffee is beyond words :) They have all the essentials to making your own coffee to your preferences. They also have some not-so-ordinary pastries on display that look delicious. \n\nOverall, I am giving Lola Coffee five stars. I loved the location, the inner setting and the people that work there. Great service and a great commodity! \n\nFive stars for this Cenpho coffee house :)"
0,"Terrible service, i went here to only get a flat tire replaced. They said i needed new brakes so I said ok lets change them. I told the manager or the person helping me at the front desk that i was in a rush and wanted to order the brakes and come back. They basically had me sit in the waiting room for an hour before i came out to see what was going on. They spent an hour putting my rim on the WRONG size tire. When i told him that i needed to leave he said ok we will put your tires back on and let you leave. I reminded him i had a flat tire and was riding on a spare. The whole reason i came to them was to get one tire fixed and they made me wait an hour just to screw it all up. Worst care service i have ever gotten hands down"
2,They put so much cream cheese on the bagel that you can barely taste the bagel. And I'm okay with that.
3,"Nobu offers Japanese fusion cuisine in an elegant modern but yet traditional Japanese setting.  There were numerous courses of beautifully prepared and imaginatively presented food on small plates the standard Japanese Isakaya (tapas).  My favorites were teeter tots which were absolutely incredible.  The spicy miso sauce was very addictive, and fried tofu with green onions on top is excellent.   The soft shell crab sandwich was good, but I think I like it more in a sushi roll.  As for dessert, after seeing everyone's order, I just couldn't resist not to order one for myself.  I have ordered the Orange-almond fritters, the smell of the orange in the warm fritters are splendid, and tasted even better.  The exotic flavor of the jasmine tea ice cream was very refreshing; just wish they have another scoop on it.   I took the pork belly buns home, and tried the next day. The braised pork belly buns with preserved mustard cabbage vegetable remained me of a Chinese-style dish that my dad loves.  Actually, I preferred something different than the fatty pork belly in the bun.  I just don't like the texture of the fatty part of the meat.    Overall, I had a superb UYE dinner at Nobu.  I am glad that they participated in Yelp Eats Week.   I hope they will be back for next Yelp Eats Week.  Thanks so much for organizing this, Lindsey!"
1,"Reading the yelp reviews prior to my visit, I was expecting a lot more. While the hostesses were friendly, the waiter I had was not. He was short, despite me being very polite, and that frustrates me when I am patronizing a business. \n\nI ordered the vegetarian fajitas, but was dismayed when I was offered a side of rice. As a precaution, I asked if the rice had any meat in it or if it was cooked in a meat based broth. Indeed, it is cooked in chicken stock. Okay, why, then, was I offered it if I ordered off the vegetarian section of the menu? 15 minutes later, I was brought a complimentary appetizer soup. Again asking the same question, I was told that this, too, had chicken stock in it. Hmm.\n\nMy suggestion to Juan: please tell your staff to not offer meat-based items to those guests who order off of the vegetarian section of the menu. Or, offer them, but indicate right then that they are made with meat-based ingredients. \n\nWhen my entree came out, the pan was barren and a couple veggies that were listed on the menu were not served. And the taste was nothing to get excited over. There are two other Mexican spots in town that have delicious veggie fajitas, and these ones just left me yearning for more."
0,"We stayed at the Hilton Phoenix Airport hotel for one night on our way back to Philadelphia from Hawaii. We weren't planning on staying over in Phoenix, but with many flights getting canceled due to the snow in Philly, we decided to delay our flight and spend the night. \n\nWe just spent a wonderful week at the Hilton Waikoloa, and my husband stays in Hiltons for work several days each month-- so we really trust the Hilton brand. Sadly, however, our experience at the Hilton Phoenix Airport hotel was an exception. We were quite surprised by the poor quality of the hotel all around. \n\nFirst, our flight arrived at 9 AM, so we knew we had several hours until our room would be ready. We asked the front desk if we could check in early (before 3), and they said that they would try to have a room ready early but that there would be a charge for early check in. We realize that there is probably a policy that states we should be charged for early check-in, but we have never, at other Hilton properties, been told we had to pay extra for that. We elected not to pay extra, and as there is nothing really in walking distance, we spent the morning and early afternoon in the common space of the hotel. There is an outdoor patio/pool space that has the potential to be very nice.\n\nHowever, the hotel property is dated, and is not kept up. Some examples of things that made us cringe: There were drink cups left laying around for the entire day, there was a big pile of cigarette butts sitting on top of one of the umbrellas by the pool (see picture), the room, when we eventually got it, smelled like bad body odor, there were (ketchup? coffee? blood?) stains splattered on the curtains in the hotel room (see picture), and the balcony facing the freeway and parking lot was tiny without enough room to sit. One of the worst -- the toilet seat in the bathroom was way too small for the toilet (see picture), so needless to say, it was not an enjoyable experience for me to go in to use the toilet after the boys in the family had used it and got the rim of the toilet dirty. The toilet was not even properly attached to the wall so the whole toilet would rock and bang against the wall when someone sat down. \n\nI had a terrible night's sleep because every time someone on the hall closed the door to their hotel room or the executive lounge, the whole wall shook and the sound echoed loudly down the hall. \n\nThe pool was nice for the kids to play in, but the hot tub was broken. \n\nThe wireless internet was so slow (slower than dial-up), it was hardly worth my time to sit there and wait for it to load anything.\n\nThe executive lounge was average, with a nice sitting area and TVs. The food was below average-- lacking in variety, and the service was grouchy. The internet on the computers  was not working the entire time we were there, so no chance to print boarding passes.\n\nThere is nothing within walking distance besides a bunch of other hotels.\n\nWe ate at Rennick's restaurant, with some eager anticipation because we were hungry and the menu looked decent, and it was our only option. We sat outside in the lovely and peaceful courtyard by the fountain. The waitress was very earnest and sweet. I ordered a Tuna MELT with sweet potato fries. Everything on the plate was cold, though the plate was warm. There was a sprinkle of cheese on the top that looked like it was broiled for 20 seconds to brown, but even that was cold. I asked the waitress to have them re-heat the sandwich, and maybe put a little more cheese on the top. She returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries. She told me that the chef said 'that's how the sandwich is supposed to be'. She even came out with another waitress that affirmed that the tuna melt is supposed to be cold: \""it's a tuna salad and comes cold\"". I pointed out that my fries were cold. The waitress reached over and grabbed one from my plate and said \""yeah, it is cold! I'm sorry.\"" She came back later and said that the manager was running to a meeting but would take 10% off for me 'for the inconvenience.' I would have rather had some warm food! I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but it was unappetizing so I left it uneaten. Having to (mostly) pay for the food I did not eat, with not even a token attempt from the restaurant to try and fix it or get me something I liked? Total let down.\n\nThe best part of our experience at this hotel was the transportation to/from the airport. Both of the drivers were prompt, courteous and helpful.\n\nI'm sad to report all these issues with this hotel that are clearly inconsistent with the Hilton brand. I was disappointed to say the least, and I hope that Hilton will do something to bring this hotel up to par."
3,"Its great that they are open on sundays! Getting Bella the pug her rabies shots today. They also groomed her for us while she was there. If you've ever had a pug you know how much of an awesome thing this is! We are fans, Bella and I will be back when necessary."
1,"Let me first off say that Lacey, was really nice. And I'd probably lean towards a three-four star review if this were just about her. I'm going below that for the salon itself. \nI recently moved to the area and needed a color touch-up and trim. I'd been going to my past stylist for almost 8 years, and feel I know what my hair can and can't do to take color. After letting Lacey know, I let her do her thing. The trim was great, but the color seemed a bit off, but I thought I'd wait to see if it settled after a few days. \nI called about a week later and left a message at the salon saying my hair had gone red, not brunette, and to ask about using a toner to make it go cooler. My call has never been returned (although I have had their e-blast come through since). I wasn't asking for a freebie, I was asking to have what I had paid for fixed. I've tossed around calling back, and not writing this review, but as a loyal customer to a salon for almost eight years, I appreciate when a salon appreciates your business. And I take care of those that do."
3,"Great atmosphere for hanging out, but probably not the best spot for a romantic dinner.  I really Love the Bloody Marys. I crave them all the time. The antipasti options are awesome. I'm really looking to going back the next time I'm in Scottsdale"
1,This place is decent for lunch but a total bomb for dinner.  The fresh food case is totally underwhelming. The place has very good sandwiches(I think they use Boar's Head)with good bread.  They seem to also have a good selection of cheeses.  The rest really is a let down and it is fairly expensive for what little you get.  Dinner tonight consisted of two small pork sliders(fairly cold) cold mashed potatoes(extra) and it was pretty lame.  There is little to no service and nobody seems interested to be working there.  I'll be surprised if this place makes it 3 months
4,"I have only made a couple of visits here thus far, but every time, it's outstanding.  Delicious coffee drinks, cold or hot and they seem to take everything into account and invest heavily in \""doing it right\"".  The array of pastries looks amazing, but I have yet to indulge.  Nice relaxed atmosphere, great service and top notch flavors!"
3,Having had to give up golf due to the fact that something had to give a few years back it is not often that I get to a golf course. \n\nThe Tonto Bar and Grill is sitting right on a beautiful Arizona course. A course I would be in trouble if I played as the fairways are narrow and the greens are small...from what I could see anyway. \n\nBut this is not a golf review so lets get to it.....\n\nArriving at Tonto for our 6 P.M. reservation a little early so we could soak up some of the area I was mildly surprised by a group of women riding beautiful horses right in front of us and just in front of the sign for Tonto Bar and Grill. It was one of those things that just seemed right. \n\nWalking the path to the front door you are met with the usual AZ landscape fixtures...cactus...etc...but the lighting and structure are very warm and welcoming in that old west decor way. \n\nWe are met by a couple of hostesses that oddly enough could not find our reservation. This was particularly odd by the fact that I still have the email confirmation response from them for the exact date and time we were there. Oh well...\n\nWe were seated outside overlooking the course and the Arizona countryside. The sky was clear and the weather was perfect. It was quite beautiful to say the least as the sun was going down and the painted sky darkened. \n\nAfter discussing whether or not to go with a bottle of wine the group decided to head off in their own respective alky direction. \n\nI ended up having the Dogfish IPA and it was a little mild for an IPA but good nonetheless!!\n\nOur server seemed a bit overwhelmed/distracted/other and was not as attentive as one would expect at a place of this caliber. \n\nHer shortcomings did not frustrate the group as much as it could have and that is in large part due to the fact you can't help but be relaxed here.\n\nSecond beer FINALLY arrives and entrees are ordered!! \n\nI went with a NY Steak and asked for a substitute potato dish instead of the Yukon Gold fingerlings. \n\nAsking for a substitution of Sweet Potato Au Gratin seems easy enough but in the end it came a side dish. (See earlier statement about overwhelmed server)\n\nThe steak was overcooked but delicious. It was even better after I scraped off the unnecessary blue cheese. \n\nThe Sweet Potato Au Gratins were a masterpiece. thinly slice potato stacked (think lasagna) about 3 inches high!! \n\nEveryone enjoyed their dishes and coffee and desert was ordered. \n\nThe coffee was fine and the fruit covered creme  brulee was excellent!!\n\n\nI look forward to going back!!
1,"24 hours. YES. \n\nThat is my only favorite thing about this place. \nOh, and drive-thru of course...\n\nBut, for a chain.... for an INTERNATIONAL chain, I expect consistency on my $4 drinks, which I do not get here. \n\nBookies and students take up this place, and it is hard to find a seat whether you are meeting up with a friend or coming here to study. It is just too crowded. \n\nAnother thing, the smell of old espresso lingers in this store and sticks to my hair and clothes.. ick. The only thing that keeps me coming back is its convenient hours for my night owl ways."
4,"A Craigslist Purchase landed us in the Madison area, so we thought we'd give this burger place a try.  My hubbie had found it previously on Yelp and had it on his wishlist of places to try.  While as you read in the other reviews, that the place is great... there are just a few things I would mention/share with those who would be interested.\n\n- When they mean pink center for the bugers... they mean pink!  Yumminess!\n\n- The Chili Cheese Fries are great, but they come with a ton of chili peppers and onions\n\n\nParent Notes:\n- Great kids menu with burgers, grilled cheese, hot dog, corn dog & chicken fingers as the entree.  Apple sauce, fries are two of the side options.  Kiddie cocktails, soda, juice (no apple) or milk (choco too!)  are options for the drink.  All for $4.99\n\n- The Booths are a little akward sized... there is no overlap between the table and the booth its self - so my toddler in a booster seat slipped a few times.  Luckily I had one of those handy table attached seats in the car, which worked great!\n\n- Being in a campus town, there was enough noise from people talking that my toddler making lots of noises was not notices.  But enough families that we didn't feel like outsiders."
0,"We have never been so humiliated like we were today!!! We spent over 1000.00 dollars and we were asked to leave. Many others who were disruptive, and causing more caos were not escorted out.  We will never return!!!"
1,"I have mixed feelings about this place.. Its very clean, spacious, and hosts tons of fun activities..  The other patrons were very open and friendly as well which was nice. . However, I do have to say that this place is VERY frugal on their mixed drinks..  I ordered a gin and tonic and to my disappointment all I could taste was tonic, no gin...Long story short, no accommodation was made.  In fact, the bartender was incredibly rude about it.. At the time I thought no big deal, i'll just head over to another bartender for my next drink. Same thing.  The mixed drinks here just plain suck, in comparison to other gay bars in the area.. Stick to the beer.  \n\nAlso, there were drunk girls EVERYWHERE having drama scenes, which gets very annoying to listen to.. \n\nOverall, I will probably be back.. The music was fun, the dancing was fun, and besides the whole drink, or lack-thereof, and drama scenes, I had a great time and will most likely be returning.."
0,"\""You get what you pay for.\""   I was in the Marc Jacobs forum shop in Las Vegas  in Nov 2008 Thanksgiving week. I purchased a  quilted satin bucket on \""sale\"" as gift.  Well, the plastic handle & the bottom coating peeled off after 4 weeks of  \""normal\"" use.  I had contacted their rep for a credit but was told because the item was on \""sale\"" they do not credit  \""final sales.\""  Why bother to sell an item that doesn't last???   I was very disappointed coming from a high end store."
3,"We had a very nice overall experience at Sophie's.  My husband and I are very critical when it comes to semi-fine dining and we were pleasantly surprised.\n\nIt is a very quaint, cozy restaurant in a very strange area.  We started with Escargot and French Onion soup. The Escargot were very tasty and traditional. The French Onion soup probably should have been a bit more traditional. It was a tad sweet and could have used a bit more brothy richness. We opted for wine by the glass. Whatever white wine I first ordered was not drinkable and they quickly whisked it away and replaced it with another wine of my choosing with heavy apologies.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the scallops which were beautifully cooked, nice sauce and delish ricotta gnocchi. My husband had the duck and it was also superb and  very well cooked. \n\nDessert was a bit of a disappointment. We were debating between our old standby of creme brulee and lime mousse calypso. We opted away from the safe option and went with the lime calypso. It tasted as if it had been refrigerated for a while. The lime mousse wasn't limey enough and the bread bottom was a distraction and not so tasty.\n\nThe service was impeccable. We really liked our waitress and a man who we believe was the owner stopped by at each course to see how everything was. Nice touch.  \n\nOur only other criticism was the bread service.  It was warm which is a plus in my book but not that tasty. I think it could be easily improved. It was the right idea in that it was a warm crusty baguette but not that tasty.\n\nOverall, we would definitely go back there. Would we crave it? Probably not but if you are looking for a solidly very good dining experience I would send you here. It was very comfortable and cozy."
3,"Great hotel with huge rooms and within walking distance to everything uptown has to offer. Everyone we encountered were friendly and accommodating. The rooftop restaurant is expensive, but has a great view and atmosphere. Skip the food and get a couple drinks at the bar. \n\nValet parking is expensive ($20 daily), but you can park in the lot right in front of the building for $7 every 12 hours."
0,"I went throught the drive up window. The women who took the order was very rude and when we got to the window i paid and she handed me my 2 large sodas. She gave the first one to me fine. And the second one she let go and it fell and spilled all in my car. Not to mention we had to ask her for hot sauce. Every time I go there, she acts like she is in such a rush and is so rude. There were no cars at all in the drive up. So what's what rush? I will never go through the drive up again. And who knows i probably wont come to this location anymore. Terrible service."
3,"So I came here once before but it was never for the Dim Sum. I noticed that they have Dim Sum all day which is weird to me since most places here stop serving Dim Sum around 2 or 3pm. I've been to a couple places that are popular here in town, but most we tried never left a good impression by the end of our meal. The last time I ever had good Dim Sum was in Hawaii, which is where I am from. So finding a place here in Vegas which had decent Dim Sum was a chore in itself. \n\nMy parents and I went out to have Dim Sum since it was their anniversary, and we decided to give Orchids a shot. We were surprised, the flavor was definitely not lacking and the prices where a bit higher than other places, but not too much-quite reasonable. The selection wasn't bad either, it wasn't on the more authentic side but it was enough for everyone to enjoy and feel satisfied. \n\nWe went there on a Thursday around 3p and it was a little busy but not so busy to where you are waiting for a table, we were seated right away. I am glad that my parents were quite pleased, and I was too. We will be back!"
4,"My fear and avoidance of the dentist has been building for years. However, I simply couldn't put it off any longer. With trepidation I scheduled an appointment at Downtown Dental and promptly received an email back with available times. I went in not knowing what to expect. Not only had the staff already found my insurance information they made a point to call me by the name I go by rather than my formal name and that put me at ease. I sat down with Heather, the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist. She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry. There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda, which is always annoying. Then the scary part... the dental work. It was uncomfortable and I hated it, but soon it was over, it wasn't that bad and I felt a thousand times better. Dr. Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of. Then the even scarier part (or so I anticipated)...the price! But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than I'd been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems. In fact the total cost is very reasonable; this isn't a dentist looking to take advantage of you. I couldn't have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office. The convenient downtown location only makes it better. I will never go to another dentist again and I'm actually looking forward to my next appointment. I can't recommend this office enough."
1,"This seems to be one of the many places in Charlotte where it comes highly recommended, impresses you on first entry into the restaurant with the decor, waters your palette at first sight of the menu, and then leaves you feeling very unsatisfied when the actual meal comes.  A beautifully presented restaurant, menu, and plate of food....but they seemingly forget that what brings people back is the actual preparation of the food and the ingredients used.  I had the calamari and tuna and both were poorly cooked, underseasoned, and the ingredients did not taste fresh or well selected.  Will not go back.  In Charlotte, you have a lot of bad imitations of fine restaurants.  This is another one.  For fine dining in Charlotte, I would stick with The Palm, Capital Grille, Ruth Chris, Morton's, etc....  If you are really craving seafood, I would go with Upstream instead."
1,"If you never trusted a review today I share my opinion of my disappointing visit,well today I must say this place DIDN'T do right be me. I feel if your paying 79.00 for detail. Detail it,  you spent more energy selling me the sh#*,then detail the sh#* out if it. they have enough men there. Why so sloppy. I swear my lazy azz could have done better. I took it back pointed out the obvious,still no satisfaction. Don't waste your time here for a detail. This place dont know the  meaning of that word. Get your wash and move on."
3,"Stopped in here today as I was in the area and it was kinda gloomy weather, perfect for pho!  I'm a fan of Pho Van down the road and wanted to compare this place.  I only get Pho Ga (chicken) and it seems that it always tastes pretty much the same no matter where I go, so all I can really compare/rate is the service and the \""extras\"".  By extras, I mean the tasty goodness that you put into pho - like cilantro, onions, bean sprouts, limes, etc.\n\nService was good, quick and friendly.\n\nThen came the extras.  A mound of bean sprouts (good start), 3 slices fresh jalapeno (good), 1 slice lime (so-so) but no onions or cilantro (bad news).  I asked the server for cilantro and onions.  She hesitated for a second, then nodded, but still seemed surprised at my request (wha?! what pho place doesn't give you cilantro and onions??).\n\nShe brought my bowl of steaming hot pho, still no cilantro and onions, but I did see that there was a layer of cilantro and onions floating in the soup.  I guess that will have to do.\n\nI had to ask for soy sauce.  (Wha?! What pho place doesn't have soy sauce on the table??)\n\nSO, overall, VERY delicious (I don't think I left a single drop of broth in that bowl), but I was a little miffed by the lack of \""extras\"".  For $6.75 though, a good meal and I would come in again."
2,"Pretty good, for the most part. Lots of registers to get you out fast. Not as many clerks (to help find things) as I would like. I spend a lot of time searching for what I want. It's a huge store. Wish they were open later than 10PM. Other than that, it carries a lot of diverse products, which is what I want for a Target Store.\nBTW...In recognition to Rod's review, they have taken away those absurd speed bumps."
4,"We just had a wonderful experience at this Denny's. The host was very kind, as was our waitress, Mandy. They took the Fried Cheese Melt off the menu but the waitress was able to have it made. There was some gum stuck to the booth and it got on the back of my pants. I mentioned it to the waitress and she brought over some ice so I could attempt to get the gum off.  She even offered to get it off for me. I was cleaning it off and the manager came over and apologized. He took 20% off our meal and gave us two more 20% off coupons. He said if I had to get the pants dry cleaned then they would cover the bill. It really wasn't a big deal but they were very nice about the whole thing. Anyway, the food was very good and the service was great. I will definitely be returning to this location."
3,"I am a fan of Cosmopolitan. After staying in their regular room and getting to hangout in the wrap around corner suite, it automatically became my favorite place to stay at in Vegas. The hotel is modern, clean, and is packed with a young vibe that surrounds the entire area. The elevators are close to the parking lot and the front office and valet which makes everything convenient. Marquee Day and Nightclub are right up the escalators and the casino is always lively. Stay here is you want a great stay in Vegas. The wraparound room overlooked the Bellagio fountains and Marquee where there are lounge chairs to enjoy the view. \n\nThe only issues that I had was that the drain for the shower seemed clogged and the valet guy gave us problems for carrying in alcohol. I didn't know that you can't carry in a bottle into the hotel and that if you do, it has to be concealed. Palazzo and Venetian let us carry it in openly all of the time. -__-\n\nOtherwise, I will be back!"
4,"DEEEEEELICIOUS!!!!  The flavors, the quality of the meat, the toppings, and the Sweet Potatoe fries, omgoodness, FANTASTIC!!!!   The service was excellent as well, our server was very attentive!  It was an absolute fabulous lunch!!!"
2,"I recently went here for the first time and I had low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised. It isn't fancy, but it's comfortable and cozy. Friendly service and reasonable prices. I like the bbq brisket sanwich with a baked potato."
3,"This is an interesting place.  Their menu is a small novel with plenty of options for meat and fish fans.  We started off with the Seared Tuna Nachos, very tasty and love the idea of each nacho chip being carefully stacked with the ingredients mentioned on the menu.  All 5 chips are fresh and topped with goodness.  My girlfriend and I split our main meals; I had The Green Monster, sounded great on the menu but there was no flavor to the meat, no salt, pepper, garlic salt, nothing.  The ingredients the flavorless burger had stacked on it didn't offer anything either, I could only taste the jalapenos.  My girlfriend's choice was the Taste Explosion from their Burgushi section, lots of flavor, however very heavy and wouldn't choose it again if I was the only one eating it.  Although heavy, the Taste Explosion is definitely a menu option I would get again to share.  Minus the burger, good spot to check out, there's something on the menu for all."
0,"This place leaves a lot to desired. My dad and I went during the week because he was craving Mexican food. So, I suggested we give Gil's a shot - trying to support local restaurants. \n\nIt was in a pretty dingy strip mall but we weren't deterred. There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). \n\nWe started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. \n\nThen, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned. \n\nFor entrees I got a shredded beef taco and my dad got a combo plate with an enchilada, rice and beans. Pretty bad - bland and nothing to come back for. \n\nThe 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you're wanting Mexican food, you'd be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel's. \n\nAnd my rating is not because I'm comparing this place to normal \""Mexican food\"" places - I know this place is supposed to be \""New Mexican.\"" I have been to good New Mexican food restaurants - this will never be one of them."
4,"I recently found Glow for waxing and skin services. What impressed me the most was the knowledge and expertise that Jessica has..she is a great aesthetician that was able to answer all of my \""why\"" questions.  I won't be driving to Scottsdale anymore!"
4,Lazy dog grooming is the best. They took such care and we are so pleased with how Max looks and the good service they extended to us and our dog can't recommend them enough!
0,"First time here and the last..\nWe went thru about 11pm and ordered tacos and med Pepsi. \nThey had NO drinks available. So we just got the tacos. It took them a while to get the order and we only ordered 8.They even had us back up so the timer would stop at the window!!\nWhen we got the food we went right home maybe a 5min drive. the tacos were cold and hard. So what took them so long in making our tacos? They were not fresh, there was no one in line behind us nor inside the place.\nWill not go back waste of our time and money"
4,"Out of all the Firefly's in Vegas, this is still the best one. Serious local hang. Cheap, quality food. I eat here three times a week."
2,"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. I had the pork taco and the fish taco. The tacos range from $1-1.50, they are the tiny shell tacos like you see with street vendors. The pork is diced small and the flavor was delicious. The fish taco was good, but mine wasn't to die for. The shells in either taco were not heated. Liked the homemade salsas that accompany the tacos. The owner and his staff were very friendly. My brother had the carne asada burrito and really enjoyed the flavor. He also ordered the tamale but was not very impressed with that. Not much meat and small. The prices are great. We fed 3 people w/canned cokes for $12! If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely go back to try other items, but won't make another special trip. All in all, a good experience! It's a small place with about 6-7 tables. At 4pm on Saturday it was busy, the patio didn't have any seating out there. Wouldn't recommend large groups unless you're doing takeout."
0,Great looking restaurant.  We couldn't enjoy the atmosphere though since they crammed everyone in the restaurant into one tiny section.  I agree with the comment about the food being a joke.  Service wasn't great either - lots of employees around but few smiles or greetings.  Don't be fooled by the looks of this place if you want to have a nice dinner.
0,"Oh, dear.\n\nI've never seen a kitchen put out so much inedible food, to be honest. Regardless of the price. But in my opinion, that is also an issue. The service and management were really great in corresponding with us, as we kept sending back plate after plate after plate... then had to end the meal having not had one single edible bite and eat elsewhere. They were courteous (as we were with them), and we felt badly toward the server and manager but it just wasn't doable.\n\nWe tried the sushi and the cooked kitchen menu items. It was all just a mess. Their entrees (i.e. General Tso Chicken, Singapore Noodles) are priced in the $20-30+ range and taste much worse in quality as Panda Express (which I could call gourmet compared to this place).  The sushi rolls are relatively creative on paper, and then I would like you to imagine placing rancid old raw fish into your mouth. What they call \""belly tuna\"" might have looked like belly tuna but I was fooled (shame on me). I will almost take responsibility for ordering belly tuna when it seemed way too good to be true.\n\nI had to spit all of Rice & Company's food out of my mouth. It was incredible. How they still exist and get regular traffic through the place, I understand because it's in Vegas. But otherwise, wtf is the only thing going through my head when thinking about this place."
2,"Heard about it and decided to try it while on a mini-vaca -- we ordered the BBQ feast served on the lid of a garbage can (a replica). I really liked the presentation, it was jaw dropping. A feast for about 2 1/2 people ----- a full slab of St. Louis ribs, a whole Chicken, 1/2 lb. of either Texas Beef Brisket or Chopped Pork, Coleslaw,  Fries, Mmmm good baked Beans, two corn-on-the-cob corn bread --- all we had left was two pieces of chicken and a few fries, we had to roll out of the booth. I have no complaints the food and service were very good! The price was reasonable for the amount of food they serve.  Tried the different sauces but I only liked the sweeter sauce. I can't wait to go back."
4,Great little place. The waitress (nicole) and cook (shorty) were both VERY NICE!  I'll definitely be back!!!
4,"Everything that my husband and I tried was exceptional... It is cafeteria style southern cuisine... We tried the fried chicken, collard greens, Mac and cheese, cornbread and black eyed peas... Everything is amazing, and very reasonably priced, my suggestion is to go early and beat the lunch crowd, because it got jammed around 12pm because of neighboring businesses letting out for lunch..."
2,"Went a few nights ago, on a Friday night. First Friday to be exact.  To say the place was crowded would be an understatement.  They are already short on space, and this made it worse.\nIt was noisy, and crowded. As \""yuppie\"" as this place is, the prices of the beers were not as expensive as I thought.\nI was with a party of four, we ordered several beers and a lots of snacks, and were served promptly.  Service was good."
3,"Just got my hair cut by Traci today. She was very nice and attentive, and really listened to what I wanted. She did a very good job for a very reasonable price."
2,"Half of ANY drink and a great little $5 food menu late at night! I got the gyro sliders and herb fries...yum. It turned out they gave the wrong receipt out and someone unknowingly paid for our food...oops. Good for us, bad for them. Which brings me to my next point. This is the third time I've been here and the service is always spotty; thus the 3 stars. If you don't order right away, don't plan on ordering for awhile because they will run off and ignore you. I don't know about gambling, but you can do that there...as anywhere in Vegas I guess lol. And they have lots of couches, but I usually sit at the bar."
2,"Step into a Southern-style bar and get ugly? Well, to each own experience. If you must or must not. I had that pleasure when just enough for a quick rest and feel the \""bar\"" experience for the time being during a night out in the city, but it did not bring back the \""Coyote Ugly\"" feel of the movie. If you've seen the movie, do not expect such to be. As it is located by the \""Strip\"", a name for Las Vegas Boulevard, expect loud, crowded atmosphere with beautiful patrons. Standing room. Not much of dancing on the bar top, there was dancing but nothing like in the movie. Cowgirls. Bouncers are there to keep rowdiness in check. If you'd like to dance on th stage, you get free shots of drink. Still it was fun. Music? from the jukebox. Patrons pick it. Singing? There's Karaoke to get those vocal chords working. Sing country music or rock songs. Look up over head, female acoutrements which are cup-like (okay, that's the bra to layman's term) hangs above. The light looks mistily fogged from smoke, whiff second-hand smoke. Bartenders worked with the crowd who have waited for the attention for some time. Cute waitresses. Friendly staff. Pricey drinks. But that's what it is when it's the most visited bar in the city that stays open till three in the morning. Expect to be patient and not take the fun out of a Vegas night visit to a hot bar with feeling un-bar happy. I could only hum that song from the movie to get me in the Coyote Ugly mood and I like that song. To those wanting to imbibe on this bar experience, it is final tonight 2013 March 1st, as it closes. Well then it was at service for twenty years. But it stays open in other US cities and globally, to name some: New York, Nashville, New Orleans, Novosibirsk in Russia, Key West in Florida, St. Petersburg in Russia, Germany, San Antonio in Texas, Oklahoma, etc. Want to re-live the experience, see \""Coyote Ugly\"" movie and dream it was. What was that song played in that movie, which I like? It's \""Can't Fight the Moonlight\"", a pop song written by Diane Warren, recorded by country pop singer LeAnn Rimes http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPA5QBr_YmM There I go now, singing and humming http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfzNb6JGwT0 that song... \""You can try to resist... you'll surrender your heart...\"""
4,"This place may be newest favorite place to go to. Too bad it's so dang far from me! The location is downtown but it's all brand new so the inside is pretty uh-mazing!\n\nThe first time we went was spring break weekend. It was probably not the best time to check it out as there was sooooo many kids. Even the employees told us to either come on the weekday or come early. The hours change as we head into the summer so make sure you check what time they open. \n\nWe decided on a season pass as $12 a person even for little tots was just worth it. We got the Mac daddy of season passes where we can bring a total of 8 people into the museum. Anyways, downstairs there is the water world, toddler town and the ship room. Water world is pretty popular as it's right by the door. The summit is this huge and I mean huge 3 story thing that has so many activities that you could probably be in there for a good couple of hrs. \n\nOverall it's really neat. However, it is probably not as suitable for toddlers under 3? There were a lot of mind solving activities which I would have loved to do but with a tot in tow it's not the best idea. There's staff everywhere and bathrooms on each floor (3 stories). I would def recommend this place!"
0,"This hotel is TERRIBLE!  It's under construction and it's a mess to even enter. My room was new, but the bathroom was original & bad!  I couldn't turn the shower on, the handle was broken,  so I called the desk at 10am for someone to fix it. At 5pm I still hadn't taken a shower because NO ONE CAME UP TO FIX IT!  When I checked out I asked for them to take $ off. The desk mgr Sara was rude & snotty!!!!  She took $35 off. Whoohoo!  $35!  She wouldn't even take the $20 resort fee off. Her explanation was...\"" EVERYONE PAYS THE RESORT FEE!\""  Do not go there!  Go to THE RIO!!!!  And the Rio I hear has a great buffet!  Or ANYWHERE ELSE but THERE!!!!  I wouldn't even give it one star but I couldn't post this w/o a star!"
4,"Favorite Italian spot to go. Love the ravioli! Haven't gotten anything there I didn't like. Reasonably priced, quiet atmosphere, and the servers are always pleasant."
4,"The food here is amazing! It's always a debate between this location and the original, because the food is great at both, but the other one is inside a bar. If you want no cigarettes, quiet relaxed restaurant, come to this location. If you want a good place to watch a game, with a full bar, etc then go to the other location.\n\nNo matter which location you choose, the food will be delicious! I know their highlight is the pizza, but don't be afraid to try out some of the daily specials too. Chris is an actual chef, not just a pizza cook. He always has interesting items that include things like homemade pasta, truffles etc. Go for it!"
3,"After watching the food network channel, my bf and I suddenly wanted fried seafood. We considered Long John Silvers, Pete's Fish & Chips, but wanted to try something new. After looking through Yelp, Good Guys Seafood stood out because they had good reviews and they were located pretty close to home and it was something new. The restaurant is very clean, bright, and spacious. We were greeted by a super nice and sweet lady behind the counter named Yolanda. The previous posts are true, she's super nice and very helpful. We got the fried oyster po boy and the 3 fried fish and shrimp plate. The food was really good, it came out piping hot and fresh out of the fryer. \nI have to say that their fried shrimp was AMAZING! They were really big (we were pretty impressed), perfectly cooked, cleaned and de-veined, crispy, great flavor! I now know where to come when I want fried shrimp. The shrimp was seriously so good and everyone should go try some! The price for the food was very reasonably priced. Yolanda came and checked on us to see how everything was. Their fish was battered with corn meal and was really good. Their portion size is really good, and they gave me an extra fish and shrimp I think because it was my first time there. I would definitely recommend this place!"
4,Totally breathtaking!  At the apex you're 550 feet above the strip. You can see everything. Must do!  The only thing I would do different is doing it at night.
4,"My boyfriend made dinner reservations to eat at Bouchon while we were on our Vegas trip. He knew about the chef, Thomas Keller and his other restaurant in Napa (French Laundry) and wanted to try this place out. \n\nEverything from the service to our entrees were impeccable! Our waiter (which his name escapes me) was incredible. Very charming, greeted us respectively and warmly. He let us know some info about the restaurant and the specials of the day that we ended up deciding to have. \n\nWe trusted the waiter's palate for the food, so for starters, we tried this pork belly dish that was HEAVEN in your mouth. We also decided to try the oysters that they get shipped daily. If I can remember, he said they have 4 types of oysters and we tried the best two. You can taste the ocean in each bite!  Entree that i picked out was veal chop sous vied with grilled cremini mushroom while the boyfriend got the grilled sturgeon with trio of beets and ramps. We were both floored when we tried the veal... one of my favorite dishes of all time! The sturgeon was perfectly grilled, great texture and better without the sauce IMHO. As for the sides, I liked my boyfriend's beet trio and ramps over the mushroom and \""something else\"". \n\nDesert was hard to avoid... they had a selection of deserts varying from cheesecake, creme brulee (my favorite), to ice creams and sorbet (which we chose). We had the mango and passion fruit sorbet which needless to say, was a perfect ending to a great meal. \n\nNow to try French Laundry..."
3,Their lechon is so good! It takes awhile to pick up but it's worth it! I'll eat here when I feel like getting some lechon
2,I thought this show was just ok. There were 6 of us and we all paid full price so it was hard to fell like you got your monies worth ($53 for 1 hr show).
2,"This is supposed to be the new benchmark in terms of buffets in Vegas.  The insane line to get in is artificially conjured by intentionally being inefficient with their table clean up and seating.  You'll see plenty of open tables during your 2-3 hours wait to sit down!  And hell that's genius on their part since they offer a cut in front of the line option for an additional 15 bucks!\n\nThe overall food quality is pretty good though i'll give them that but there is a crazy line to get all of the \""good stuff\"" like crab legs and prime rib.  I mean i eventually  gave up and just ate the random stuff that didn't have a line.    I could have easily eaten 2-3x as much raw oysters and crabs legs if the line wasn't so insane.  Another genius move on their part to move these lines a long so slowly.\n\nI mean if you are one of those people that love buffets then definitely check this place out but personally I think you are much better off at one of the many great restaurants in vegas."
3,"Awesome place, cute girl bartender, cold beer, what else do you need! Yelp special is $1 dollar for a pint and FourSqaure special has a 25 cent pint special, nice!!!"

It will be loud!\nYou can here the freaks below sneezing, never mind the horrible music.\n\nThe elevators are hot and stink, and chug up and down....like they are about to break down.\n\nThe D Grill isn't bad...breakfast is ok and inexpensive.\n\nAfter a room change to the \""quiet\"" side of the hotel, we were stuck in handicap room, had to call and report the AC not working, a broken shower, and toilet not flushing issues."
4,So good!!! This joint and Harley's Bistro in midtown have the best pizza in the city!!
0,Why bother reviewing? To warn my fellow Yelpers of course. \n\nIt was bland and unfortunately there is such a thing as a tasteless burrito. The salsa was boring as it was all heat and no flavor. The blue corn tortilla wrap they use tastes like recycled cardboard and the price was an added insult. \n\nThis was clearly a mistake in the culinary pantheon of airport layover meals. \n\nStay away. You may find more authentic Mexican at Chipotle.
2,"Hello from Japan!\n\nFor those following my reviews, I am Yelping from Sendai city in beautiful Miyagi prefecture (two hours north of Tokyo).  I am working here as an ALT, so I'm going to be here for a while.  I'm going to get my last reviews in because I miss Yelp, and wish I could yelp some of the great places I've been to here in Japan.\n\n(Sorry for that tangent... on to the review!)\n\nI came to Paymon's about a month ago when I was supervising a group of international students to Sin City.  Echoing my previous reviews, I find that the best restaurants and treasures in Vegas definitely come from the locals, and it wasn't long before buddy Francis C. took me here for a late lunch.\n\nPaymon's specializes in Mediterranean caf\u00e9 style foods- a cuisine I've never really touched before, so my choices here were definitely on the safe side.  Conveniently located a few blocks away from the Strip, Paymon's offers a great atmosphere to enjoy a nice meal, as well as a hookah bar right next door (however, you must be 21 or older to enter).  When we went, we sat in between the restaurant and the bar in this extremely nice patio area, where natural sunlight was where it was at.\n\nService that day was decent.  We placed a few orders of fries, and I ordered the chicken marsala for my hefty meal.  Our food took a bit for it to come out, which confused us because a couple of other parties received theirs before ours (and we felt it was a pretty small meal).  When I finally received my chicken marsala, I was ready to sink my mouth into that piece of chicken.   In terms of the taste, the flavors didn't do much for me.  It wasn't bad at all, but nothing about my meal struck me.  The piece of fried chicken breast was okay, and my sauce over the noodles were simply average.  However, they do give a good sized portion for you hungry gamblers out there.\n\nEven though my meal wasn't completely mind-blowing, I did enjoy the French fries and the on-and-off lighting inside the patio.  Next time I come, I will definitely venture off and try the more Mediterranean options that Paymon's is known for.\n\nParking is plentiful outside in a private lot with other businesses."
0,There is a clear lack of organizational process and customer service from my experience with this organization. Ranging from long wait times to being unable to find records even when I sent them myself. I would have to agree with the majority of comments posted here. I was personally told they didn't care about Internet reviews by their office manager after mentioning the negative feed back I  had read.  Without going into details I would say keep looking better options are out there.
0,Came here with a Groupon because I would not come to the Paris otherwise. Never had a good experience here and this place lives up to my expectations.  The service was terrible and the place smelled like vomit. Not worth coming here even with a Groupon.
4,"My house's front screen door deadbolt got jammed and I can usually jimmy it a bit and finally unlock it but this time I couldn't.  I called Alcatraz a little late in the evening and explained my situation.  At first I was a little put off by the service fee but it needed to be done so I went along with it.  I briefly remember calling a locksmith for my car one time and was left with a $200 bill, and then I called another time for a different house lock issue and the guy wouldn't even give me any pricing so I ended up not fixing whatever it was because I was afraid of the bill.  My home is currently on the market so I needed to get the front door opened obviously so I prepared myself for a nice little bill.  The total with the service fee was far less than I expected.  The people I worked with were extremely polite.  I am so glad to have found this company.  Definitely keeping their number in case I ever need a locksmith."
1,"I am a degenerate gambler and I have played in and stayed in every hotel in Las Vegas.  From the Circus Circus to Imperial Palace to the downtown hotels to the local casinos to the Venetian and Wynn.  One word in reference to the Wynn Hotel and Casino:  HYPE\nThey are hurting for business bigtime because they recently introduced a resort fee that is charged per night of stay.  They want to charge me to use the pool and WIFI?  LMAO!!!  \n\nWhat is the all the hype about this casino?  The food sucks.  The casino games are the same games found in any casino.  Do you guys really get excited by the architecture of the building?  Do you enjoy standing in a line of 100 people to get into a nightclub?  Do you guys enjoy being packed in a nightclub like a bunch of canned sardines?  \n\nIf you are not getting your rooms comped, save your money and stay at a place like Treasure Island.   \n\nI am convinced that people stay here just to brag to their friends that they stayed at the Wynn.  Same type of suckers who go to those high end restaurants like that pathetic restaurant carnevino at Palazzo.  They just want to take pictures and upload it to their twitter/facebook and try to rub it in their friend's faces.  I get comped to eat these places and I never do.  The food sucks.  I prefer the food court on the casino floor at the Venetian.  Believe me, the cheeseburger or philly cheesesteak at the food court tastes better than anything that carnevino can produce.  A 5 dollar an hour employee makes better food than a 5 star chef in a 5 star restaurant.  Believe it."
0,"I usually am the type that only writes positive reviews. I am not the vindictive type of person. I can tell you, with certainty, this place does good work. However, that is not their problem. Their business practices are awful. The owner conducted a bait and switch on me. I had them write down the prices of their services which included shoes and pants and then when I came to pick it up, prices went up. Even prices that had tags on them for a certain amount, the owner expressed to me that they are old prices and charged 5 extra dollars after the work was already done, which I know is BS. I was warned by a friend not to go there and to go to Brothers Tailors on the other side of Camelback. For one pair of shoes they charged double because it needed a little extra work, maybe five minutes extra that I could have fixed myself if I had the time.  It reminds me of shopping in the arab marketplace in the old city in Jerusalem. It is an absolute shame that an establishment with a mezzuzah on the door treats clients with such blatant disrespect. It really is my mistake for going back there, it is not the first time they have done this to me. Plus they charge extra if you want to use a card - which is against visa bylaws. I never write bad reviews, I think its bad karma, but be warned when you walk in this store, you will get ripped off. I am 2 for 2. First time shame on them, second time shame on me for going back. \n\nRIPOFF!!!!!!!!!! BAD BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"As someone who hardly ever desires crepes, I figured Jean could be the one to persuade me. They offer both sweet and savory options with a huge pastry and gelato section. My bf and I decided to order two savory crepes and gelato for dessert.\n\nSmoked Salmon -- Their most popular option that's stuffed with pico de gallo, asparagus, spinach, and smoked salmon with a caper aioli. The savory crepe batter is a little different and tastes like it contains wheat. We thought the first few bites were yummy but quickly got over it. The pico de gallo was also too spicy for me :(\n\nChicken -- Tasted like one of my deconstructed chicken wraps except they're chipotle sauce is note. Simple option and chicken wasn't dry.\n\nTheir pastry selection was beautiful yet expensive! We also thought the gelato was only okay but at least they offer white chocolate cones. We probably won't come back because the crepes aren't worth $13 each. Maybe they're dessert crepes are better.."
3,"Found out about this place via a friend of mine, the folks that own the place are her neighbors and they are no joke legit Italians from Italy. I went to their grand opening and had one of the pizza's, it was tasty! The crust was nice and thin and crispy and there was a good amount of everything as far as sauce, toppings and cheese go. The sauce was super flavorful and had the right amount of spice to it. If I lived closer to this place it would be my regular pizza spot but it's a bit of a trek from where I am. However if I find myself in that part of town you bet i'll be stopping in!"
2,"I don't claim to be a BBQ connoisseur, but I do travel a fair amount and eat my fair share of airport food, so I do know to have lowered expectations. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but was swayed by all these other reviews. I'd say it was mediocre, slightly overpriced, but edible. I ate here once, and it was the first (and probably the last) time I will eat here. Next time I will go to Papa John's or grab a burrito.\n\nThe chicken was burnt see my picture of the chicken camouflaged against the black plate) It was more or less edible though, it wasn't much tastier than getting rotisserie chicken from Costco and throwing BBQ sauce on it.\n\nThe mashed potatoes and mac & cheese were okay - edible, but didn't leave me craving more.\n\nJust okay, wouldn't come back here again. I think Salt Lick in the Austin airport has better BBQ food. Maybe I came on an off-night but I think I'll stick to other choices next time."
4,my sisters and I had just finished the race for the cure and stopped by wineburgers for a celebratory beer and something to eat. it was a sunday and wineburgers was hopping! but the staff was friendly and attentive. the owner stopped by to say hi. he noticed our shirts from the walk and bought a round of drinks for us. and he announced the fact we walked in the race for the cure and had everyone cheer for us when we left. super fun place...great staff...great food. i will be back for sure!
0,"TERRIBLE SERVICE AND HORRIBLE RETURNS. \nDEHYDRATED SPINES ON THEIR BOOKS, CAUSING THEM TO BREAK. \n(they must store their books improperly)\n\nAfter getting half way through a book, it broke. All at once. So I took it in for a return.... the pages are in good condition, I did not take it in the water, or have it under any duress. This paperback book is completely falling apart. The cover is completely off the book, and the book itself split in 3 pieces. \nThe spine is clearly dehydrated. \nThe day this book broke, I took it in to just get a replacement, not a refund, just replaced, so I could continue to read it. \nI was told I was 4 DAYS outside of my return policy, The checker said it shouldn't be a problem but she needed to check. \n\nThe manager said she could not take it. This Manager has worked for the company for 18 years, as she expressively told me. Her name is Kathleen.\nI was stunned by the abrupt manner in which she dealt with me. The manager was rude, short and clipped with me. She was almost looking for a fight, which stunned me. She was unhelpful, and was telling me it was my fault.... of the thousands of books I've read, never in my entire life have I ever seen a book fall apart like this. \n\nI am outside of my 15 days because I bought 2 books at that time, in a series. I cant read 900+ pages of 2 books in 15 days. They could see that on my account.\n\nHow I was treated in store was unbelievable. \nI will not shop at any barnes and noble. Their lack of customer care was appalling. I will find somewhere else to purchase books. \n\nI also called, seeing if we could do anything and the manager was awful on the phone,  she actually said \""if you had a receipt maybe it would be different...\"" I told her I DID have a receipt, and had told the cashier that. \nThen, she hung up on me."

3,"I went in July to see the Auto Collection.  I'm not a big fan of cars, but I decided the free coupon was a reason to go and see what everyone had talked about.\n\nThis is a huge and great display of vintage cars and other memorabilia, especially the old jukeboxes that were for sale.  Many of the cars are for sale, too, but some are display only.  And, the place is huge with so many cars!\n\nThe Johnny Carson car was the one I wanted to see and it brought back a lot of memories of my youth.  There's a lot here for an entire family to enjoy.\n\nWith this coupon, good until the end of the year, you get one free admission.  Print as many as are in your party.  Few people paid the day I went.\n\nhttp://autocollections.com/index.cfm?action=free&tab=free"
2,"Disregard the \""get what you pay for ya'll\"" guy on the $10 pizza; he doesn't even know where the apostrophe goes in \""y'all.\"" \n\nThe $10 pizza offered on Sundays is much better than any DiGiorno, the only problem with it is that it isn't actually 20 inches. I used to work at a place that had 20 inch pies and I remember having to fold the annoyingly big box. When I saw this box, I was skeptical of the size. When the wife and I got it home, we went anal and measured it. Sure enough, not 20\"". It was like 16\"" or 17\""; that said, it's still a big pizza for $10- just not sure why they'd lie when you can measure the box and see it is 18\"" or whatever. \n\nStill, pizza was surprisingly tasty and plenty hot. Maybe try getting there to get your pizza on time, dude. Not sure why anyone would want a pie that's been sitting under a heat lamp, anyhow."
4,Great Greek and Italian restaurant! I took my in-laws from NYC to Dino's and they loved the food!
1,"The novelty of eating during your movie quickly wears out due to the horrific customer service. I'm not sure if it's adequately staffed or what but after finally taking my order 40 minutes into the film, it took them another 50 minutes to bring me my food: a simple order of buffalo wings!\n\nIf you're going to the movies here and need to eat out, hit something in town first or the 347 Grill (if popcorn or icecream won't do the trick, that is)."
1,What the hell happened to this place...maybe I'm being a stickler about a buffet but this is just depressing.  No fried calamari......All the food is cold at the start of dinner.  Crab legs are like dried up carrots...never again.
4,"Second time back was even more impressed! \n\nI went for the first time in 2008 with the girls as we hit up Vegas. We 'waited' at the bar to see if we could get a table as you couldn't make reservations back then. Definitely not patient enough to get a seat on the patio we were seated 1/2 way through our first round of wines....no complaints here. We each got a few appetizers for the table and the ONLY thing I can remember from that first trip is the beef carpaccio. It literally melted in my mouth! \n\nSo headed back to Vegas for welcome in 2011 with my fiance (a magnificent cook and foodie) and 3 Australian friends. As I have been to Vegas before I wanted them to choose what they wanted to do....I had one request....ONE dinner at Olives. So we saved it for our last night. On a whim (the morning of) I went to our concierge to ask about a reservation and to my surprise she called and got us a 5:30 seating! \n\nUpon our arrival we were seated immediately. My one concern is they really packed us in there but I wasn't complaining! It was a Saturday night and I was beside myself. Bread basket has some crunchy flat cracker with seeds that went super well with the olive tampenade. I prefered the black over the green. And they should consider not chopping the olives so much...it almost was a puree but still soooo tasty. They also included a cranberry walnut chocolate roll in the bread basket. It was sweet and I was surprised it was in the before dinner basket but really liked the flavor :) I don't think I will ever turn down chocolate, I don't care what course it is on.\n\nTerry (fiance) ordered the Layer Cake, a Malbec from Argentina. Spectacular choice, we even ordered a second bottle. It is a great red that goes well with everything we ordered....and at a decent price (for restaurant wine pricing that is). I can't wait to find this for a cheaper price at my local liquor store! :)\n\nOf course I ordered the beef carpaccio as it was burned in my memory forever. I was not let down....it was as good, if not better, than I remembered!\n\nKate ordered the flatbread specialty, a wild mushroom flatbread. Very rich and filling. \n\nBevo ordered the tuna tartare, I was especially surprised and pleased with this pick! I love tuna but this seemed just so delicate and fresh.\n \nPatty ordered the squid and octopus which was served with some garbanzo beans and a smokey broth....I was really surprised of this flavoring but really enjoyed it as it was a way I have never had it seasoned and flavored before.  \n\nFor dessert Terry and I split the Butterscocth brulee. Magnificent! (and butterscotch is not my first preference when it comes to dessert flavors) This dinner just wouldn't have been complete without it. I also tasted Patty's espresso martini that was perfectly balanced of espresso and liquor!\n\nSo although we didn't do entrees we were all stuffed and each got out with about $50/person including wine and with being able to taste so much!\n\nIf I EVER make it back to Vegas my one requirement will be to make it to the patio to watch the fountains from Olives, my favorite place in Vegas!\n\nSynopsis:\n1. Get a reservation if possible (on the patio if nice weather) or be prepared to wait for a table....it is worth it!\n2. Order the beef carpaccio, you will not regret it\n3. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
2,"Featured in the \""Las Vegas Weekly\"" (01/18 - 24/07) issue under the \""11 Great Greasy Spoons\"" section, our interest was piqued!  A place that only served goat meat and nothing else?  Hmmm...\n\nIt's Friday evening and we called in to find out what time they closed.  9 pm we were told.  We rolled into the Commercial Center right before 8:30pm and excitedly walked in.  They were sweeping up and things didn't look promising.  They said we could only order to go now.  (Shute!)  \n\nNonetheless, having crawled out of bed just for this meal, we were not going to say no.  Initially expecting minimal, if any, English, the pleasant girl at the register told us there was only two things to order - chico or grande.  It was going to be either ribs or the hindquarters of the goat.  Oh well.  We got two orders of the stuff and headed out.  The goat meat was sitting in consomme, and limes, cilantro, chopped onions, and corn tortila were each wrapped separately.  \n\nOverall, the flavor of the meat was good.  It was crispy at some points, and soft and tender in other parts.  The whole thing was a bit messy and had our car smelling like onions and spices for a few days.  It was a good meal, but lacked a bit of a punch.  (We added some kick of our own when we brought it home.)\n\nI noticed they had a website and realized Birrieria Jalisco was actually their third store, the first two being in Southern California.  We felt a bit cheated, thinking this restaurant was unique on its own.  Nonetheless, we had to be impressed that a restaurant can do well on serving goat meat and nothing else.  Worthy to get out of bed for again, I'm not so sure. But a decent meal overall."
0,"Pittsburgh Bound!  Part XI\n\n(For Part X, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/F9IJ3EddoyW89O0DFikPTQ/review/D5UPfn_UbOm4iqfWgSRygw?fsid=X4Q_wJ-wTj91tUUZ_DA3Eg)\n\nWhere to begin.  Primanti Brothers is an institutional staple in the Pittsburgh area.  The restaurant is famous for their sandwiches that are smothered with French fries and coleslaw.  Originally created as a whole meal-in-one for the truck drivers making early morning deliveries to the Strip, Primanti's sandwiches have since become a local go-to for tourists and has been featured on several Travel Channel and Food Network programs. \n\nLet me impart a little local knowledge here.  The sandwiches suck.  My parents have always hated Primanti's and I've had a hit or miss experience over the years, so I had to convince her that we needed to give it one more shot.  We stood in line to get in (which pissed my mom off to no end) and when we finally sat down, the sticky table didn't leave the best first impression.  \n\nOur waiter arrived and we ordered two capicola and cheese's.  Although the prodigal sandwich was, as usual, dry and salty, it also had overwhelming flavor undertones of 'waste of money', and 'overrated'.  \n\nI've had friends visit who felt it some sort of rite of passage to indulge in salty mediocrity, and I can see how people outside of Pittsburgh would find French fries and coleslaw on a sandwich a KA-RAAAZZZY premise, but Primanti's isn't anything special and in no way worth bypassing the plethora of amazing restaurants the city has to offer.  \n\n(For Part XII, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/DGeupkmvo1X1oKn-sv9UQA/review/-HJfUYS0E_OklNDSFkWfbQ?fsid=FL_7zkBe4MUwc2VCDFMFNA)"
3,"My FAVE fro-yo place out there!  I've tried em all, I swear and this is my all time favorite!  The flavors are unique but not too weird and the topping choices are greater than other places (better selection, better quality).  I would pick Kokomo over any other fro-yo place, any day!  The atmosphere is clean and the staff is friendly, and the prices are as good as anywhere else.  Worth it!"
3,"one of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots in Vegas. I usually sit outside, and it is beautiful & comfortable when it is not too hot in Vegas.  Not the best of best, but you will enjoy their good food at beautiful Venezia hotel(Venezia is my favorite, most sophisticated building among other Venetian towers).  It is a great place for breakfast/brunch to start your day in Vegas."
3,"Really good Jewish breakfast sliders, Jewish sliders, and buffalo benedict."
3,"I love this place! \nI used to come here every day on my lunch break in highschool\nback when my pallette was a wee bit unrefined, since then i have grown up a bit and realize that there is more to asian cuisine than rice bowls\nbut thats not what this place is about, nor would i hold it against them\nIsland Teriyaki is a place where you can grab a tasty quick bite to eat for around $5 or so, everything is simple, to the point and delicious\nand for that, it draws hungry west side fans from all around\nyou'd be hardpressed to find a better lunch option in the area\npersonal favorite: the japanese style curry w/ brwn rice\nmmmm\nxtra* for the beautiful girls they have behind the counter ^___^"
4,"ate there with my boyfriend, and we enjoyed every single bite. we had an awesome waitress by the name of crystie (\\maybe crystal) and we couldn't have been more pleased. she was suggestive but not pushy. she was quick, fast and friendly. we ordered two buckets. my dude had lobster which he loved and i had a classic steampot. we eat there at least twice a month, but i will say service is not as good on the dining floor or patio. but overall, thumbs up!"
2,"Getting into this restaurant is almost like going through airport security, just without the pat down.  I had called and asked about dress code, then asked about reservations on a Tuesday night. The woman I spoke with said it was necessary if I wanted to get in.  After finally getting in, there wasn't anyone else there. In fact, they just opened and were still setting up. Great views as the restaurant rotated.  Watched the sky jumpers fly by!  Got a great waiter, Kevin.  Being my second time here, I knew the prices were a little high, IMO. But forty bucks for chicken? My wife said it was good, but forty bucks?  I understand the ambience, which was nice and the overhead. My wife wanted to split a meal with a friend who joined us because she is a light eater. The waiter told us they would have to order an 80 dollar meal and there would also be an 8 dollar plate charge.  Huh? Is this customary at most high-end restaurants?  I ordered the salmon, which was excellent. The Yukon Gold mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious.  Bread and butter was very good also. \nOverall, it was a good time.  I did expect to pay a pretty penny to eat here.  \nIf you are talking about value for the cost, though, this did not meet or exceed my expectations. But I think the next time I want a great romantic meal, I will choose some place else."
2,"I have lived here for five months now, and it hasn't been terrible but it hasn't been great either.  My particular unit was very clean and in good order when I moved in.  The only issue was that a majority of the outlets didn't work but they fixed that issue quickly.  I feel relatively safe here; I take my dog out late at night and I've never seen any \""odd\"" things going on.  I did experience one creep that tried to come into my apartment at 11:30 at night.  I called the police and they responded immediately.  Haven't had a disturbance otherwise.  It's pretty quiet here too except for a lot of the moms who yell at their kids once in a while.  We did have a pipe break and it's taken awhile for them to come out and patch up everything.  I'd say at least check it out, there's no harm in looking at the place.  It is quite spacious and each unit has its own washer and dryer which is super nice.  It's pretty close to ASU and to a lot of points of interests in Tempe.  Keep in mind you get what you pay for."
2,"Honestly, I have no idea how much my family paid for this hotel room but you get what you pay for.  For hotels near the airport, you don't really expect too much and I didn't here.  The rooms were standard, not too bad and not too good, but definitely livable for a night.  If I had to stay near the Charlotte airport again I wouldn't choose this place again but for the night I was here, I didn't mind it.\n\nThe is a shuttle that runs every half hour to the airport which was convenient.\n\nThe only problem I did have, was that I was pretty sure I saw some mold in the bathroom... gross. Besides the bathroom ( which would be enough for me to give two stars) the room and the customer service allowed for me to give it one more star."
0,"RUDE AND HASTY. I always base whether or not to get a full set/manicure by the way they care for my feet.  I was greeted and promised \""10 more minutes.\"" I sat and soaked for 15 min before a man who looked like he just built a house (dirty white shirt and dirty nails) start my pedicure.  Long story short, the shape of my nails were crooked,  he forgot to put lotion on my feet and talked sh*t about me in Vietnamese the WHOLE TIME about me being too picky while the entire staff made bets on whether or not if I was going to leave a tip.\nI paid and left the man a tip anyway. \n\nI've never been so appalled,  humiliated and dissatisfied with a service. \nI asked for the manager and there was no manager avail."
4,Our first visit and certainly it will not be the last. Our expectations were greatly exceeded. The food was excellent and we like how they have diversity in the menu selection. The prices were reasonable and decent portions.
3,"So, you know, Claim Jumper is a chain and stuff. I never go here of my own volition but occasionally when a group of work people want to go, I tag along. The food has always been just okay. But THEN. Today, on a lark, I tried the veggie burger, and WOW, it was just amazing. I mean, amazing. It was a Boca burger topped with tomato, avocado, caramelized red onions, garlic mayo, and gouda, which I switched out for goat cheese. Seriously, this thing was heaven. My one complaint is that it was served on very heavily toasted toast, which I don't think the menu indicated, and I HATE sandwiches on toast. This one was delicious enough to make up for the toast thing, but next time I'll ask for it on a roll instead. \n\nI could only eat half of this deliciousness and took the rest home in a box -  it came with a fairly large side salad for $9, which I considered to be a steal. I never thought I'd say this, but I can't wait to go back to Claim Jumper."
2,Decent food at a fair price.  More or less standard Chinese offerings with high quality ingredients.  Did not find the dishes to be very spicy but did have a good flavor.  Ours was a to go order but while waiting found the staff to be very friendly.  Not the finest Chinese I have ever had but far from the worst!  Was a good value.  I would agree that the place was clean as well.
0,"These guys remind me of Scientologists. They come up to you, manipulate you to come to their sanctuary, destroy your spirit and moral during a long presentation. Then when you are at that breaking point where you don't care anymore and will just say YES to anything that's where they get you. It's a scam, unless you enjoy losing your money don't waste your time. Once you're in, there wont be any rooms available most of the time, and even though you aren't using the time share you still have to pay for maintenance and some other BS. \n\nGood luck to you if you got suckered in."
2,I was not impressed. It was okay but it wasn't a bad experience. The honey chicken was delicious but the sushi was average. Nothing special there. They do have boba tea which is nice to have. The location is okay and in a good shopping area. Busy though. The food was okay and decent priced.
3,"This is a humble eatery, a pleasant surprise in the midst of a sordid neighborhood. The restaurant is choc-a-bloc on a weekend evening. So it is best to arrive around 7 pm, not later than that.\n\nAs indicated on their menu they start preparing the food only after the order is placed leading to a considerably long wait (45 mins to one hour). However, during the waiting period their customers have quite a few occupations like looking at the paraphernalia on the walls, sipping margaritas, devouring the crunchy tacos, listening to the loud Spanish music or looking at what other people are eating. \n\nWhatever their clients choose to do, there comes a time when the waiter places the hot plate on the table, they pick up the fork, take a mouthful and then there is calm in the din of Los Dos Molinos. In fact there is a near- Nirvana experience with every bite of the carnitas or enchiladas. \n\nAt the end the brusque manner of the waiting staff is forgotten, so is the long wait and restlessness."
2,"Large room, comfortable bed, bad TV, only vending machines for food. Air conditioner was on its last leg but I got a great rate and it served its purpose."
2,I've been bowling here quite a few times cosmic and regular and it's always been a good time. The staff has always been friendly and the bar is responsibly priced. The facility is a little bit aged but it is no way run downed. I have never eaten the food so I can't comment there. It also can get pretty pricey on Friday and Saturday nights.
4,This place is better than 5 stars it's a 10 for sure! I love sushi and this place has the freshest fish & offers a great happy hour. I can't wait to go back again. Our server was absolutely amazing!!! ( I don't remember  his name but he had glasses and dark hair with a great sense of humor - sorry )
0,"Me and my workmates slummed to the Tropicana to see the Bodies Scientific Exhibition and got hungry before we had to jet out of town.  The Garden Cafe was the only place that seemed reasonable and was open at 5pm.\n\nWHAT A MISTAKE!\n\nThe decor was repellant.  I felt like I was waiting for the Golden Girls to shuffle around the corner.  Ordering was a real ordeal, as the server didn't seem to understand his own menu.\n\nTHEN, THE HORROR BEGAN...\n\nTwo tables over, a woman gets up and starts projectile vomiting.  She starts to lumber toward our table, which was inconveniently nearest to the loo.  Her hubby seemed completely uninterested and didn't even look up from his plate.  We nearly jumped out of our skin trying to avoid the ersatz Linda Blair hulking down the aisle.  Of course, right when that trauma was over, our server comes over to offer us some soup.  Yeccch!!!\n\nThe servers didn't attempt to clean up the mess despite our repeated requests.  Repulsed, we moved to another section to avoid the stench.  The hostess actually had the nerve to come over and to order us back to our table.  EXCUSE ME, MISS?  CAN YA CLEAN UP THE BARF FIRST???  \n\nDisgusted, we bolted instead and vowed to NEVER EVER step foot in such a wretched place."
0,The lunch dim sum was greasy almost all pork and limited to one cart and a dessert cart.Service was slow and not very pleasant. I would never go back for the food. Spring rolls fried to a crisp belong in a bad fast food restaurant .
2,"Food was good. We had the Rueben (duck pastrami) with the $1 upgrade to beer mac (worth it - very good!) and the Westerner Burger (it had fried onion strings, jalapenos and BBQ sauce) with fries. The Rueben was pretty tasty but I'm a fan of duck anything. The homemade sauerkraut was more mild than normal, which I prefer. The burger was really tasty, although a bit too greasy. The fries were really good - cooked perfectly. We also ordered the Gourgeres - but it never came, which ended up working out because we were stuffed. \n\nAlthough the food was tasty, we had a very awkward experience here. We were seated directly in front of the open kitchen so we were able to see everything going on there. While waiting for our food, we kept hearing the head chef yelling at the line cooks. Grant it - they were getting the orders wrong but she was literally screaming at them several times! We felt like we were watching an episode of Hell's Kitchen. At one point,one of the wait staff was in the kitchen and she said \""Why are you in here? Do you need something?\"" and \""I don't want you just hanging around in here!\"". Geez lady, relax. There is a more professional way she could have handled it."
4,"Just relocated to the Phoenix area and needed a decent haircut.  I was very warmly received and offered a cold water while we discussed my style preferences.  The cut was full of fun conversation and extremely efficient.  I was given a neck and shoulder rubdown and a hot towel free of charge.  For sure check this place out, the cut and care goes way beyond the value of the price ($25)."
0,"My mother and I just received two of the worst haircuts we've ever had from this place. Why do stylists never go off the picture the client brings in? I've been to cosmetology school, we didnt show them unreasonable cuts for our type of hair.  But nevertheless, neither one of us got what we asked for. My bob (how hard is it to get. Bob right?) looked decent in the salon even though it was way too short and I ended up looking more like Victoria Beckham than I wanted to. When I got home I noticed how choppy, blunt, and uneven the cut really was.\n Then they messed up my mother's beautiful naturally curly hair. Not to mention two girls had to cut her hair because one was overbooked, which is very unprofessional in my opinion. The first girl had her hair looking like a stacked mess of poodle hair from the 80's. the second started to just style it, and it looked horrible until we spoke up. Once again it looked absolutely nothing like what she wanted. Then it was straightened and trimmed a bit more, which looked a little better but ended up looking like Mrs. Brady's shag. Absolutely awful. When my mother said she didn't like it, she was told, \""you'll get used to it\"". It was our fault for not being bigger bitches and demanding they fix it or refund our money. Now I have to pay someone else to get it fixed, thanks a lot Floyd's."
0,"SAY NO TO THE GROOMING SALON!  I have a 14 year old Australian Shepherd, Barbi.  I shop at this location for everything for her, I have boarded her at this location and she has been groomed at this location.  Today was her second grooming and I asked that they shave her from the summer.  I reminded the groomer that checked her in that she had arthritis.  She said, \""yes, we have that in our records.\""  Three hours later I received a call that my dog could not stand up.  They had \""partially\"" groomed her and I should come and get her.  \n\nI went to pick her up and I was horrified by her condition.  She had to be carried out from the back and could not stand at all!  She had clumps of shaven fur still hanging on her body...they had not even bothered to try and make her presentable!  They didn't take accountability for her condition and did not have an ounce of empathy for her or me.  I was in tears!\n\nThe \""Salon Manager\"" said they would not charge me for the amount of grooming they had done.  She did say \""I'm sorry\"" as I carried my 45 pound dog from the salon.  As I entered the parking lot a gentleman offered to help me to the car.  I received more empathy from him than from anyone in the salon.\n\nI called the store and complained about the salon staff to the store manager, who was nice.  However, I will NEVER shop with this location again AND probably will no longer patronize PetSmart at all."
1,I already don't like buffets so when I came here after having to wait in line for 40 mins I was seriously disappointed. Most of the food was just standard fare with some of the Middle Eastern stuff being interesting. Unlike the Bellagio where I ate until I felt like my stomach would pop I ate very sparingly here.\n\nThe only memorable thing that happened here was my friend telling me that he wanted me to go with him to the 24 hr marriage chapel to be the witness (and take pics) so he could get hitched with his girl that nite..  while I was trying to get some lamb chops..  it seemed kinda surreal at the moment.
2,"Right of the bat staff was super friendly. We were Seated almost immediately. As I was checking in I was about to redeem the check in special when I turned around our server was already on it! Nice! My burger was cooked to perfection (medium-rare) kids cleaned their plates (rare for my kiddos) a lil unconventional with the whole burgers w/ no fries. which adds to \""a bit on the pricey side\""\n\nnot once did I think it was dirty nor poor service. quite the opposite. I was expecting attitude because of the setting in the upscale trendy palazzo hotel. but I was met with a cheerful and casual setting. \n\nin short try it out its still a great burger even if it doesn't come a accompanied w/ fries....:-("
1,"Look, I'm trying to not be super critical here. They're friendly, the store's clean, and they want to help...but their selection is sub par at best. They're basically a large mall kiosk. If you want to buy an ego starter kit, or a low-end clone, or happen to particularly LOVE pink spot juice (which is all they carry, as a white-label brand) then these guys are the ticket. If you want a legit juice brand, or a non knock off brand products you're going to have to go elsewhere."
0,This place is disgusting.  Horrible customer service and they are lucky I didnt go to higher people and complain. The manager was really rude and treated me like shit. She was mad when I asked for a new burger throwing my burger in th a trash and telling me I was a problem. Because it was morning and know one else was there she got away with it her terrible attitude. Dont go to this fatburger!
4,"Earl of Sandwich is probably one of the spots I go to eat whenever I am in Vegas.  It's open 24 hours, which is great for after clubbing eats or even a quick meal before clubbing and/or a night of bar hopping.  I have been here a number of times and always try something different.  So far everything has been really good with the exception of one sandwich that i think was given to me in error.  Overall, I think this place is a gem of a place because it's cheap, tasty, quick, lots of different hot sandwiches, salads, and wraps to choose from, and is open 24 hours a day."
2,"So we were looking on yelp for some place new to order from and decided to try Those Guys Pies.\n\nWe ordered the Maui Wowie Pizza, an Original Cheesteak sandwich a order of wings and a 2 liter bottle of soda. The total was just over $40.00\n\nThe guy who took the order over the phone was friendly, the delivery guy was friendly. The food arrived in about 30 minutes.\n\nAs far as the food goes, for the price,  I was hoping it would be tastier than it was.\n\nThe wings and sandwich were pretty good. I wasn't as impressed with the pizza. \n\nIt wasn't bad, but I really wasn't overly impressed. I'll probably try it again at some point in the future."
2,Their rotating beer selection is legit. A staple year round selection is the McLovin
4,"Definitely one of the best seafood buffets I've been to! Pricey, as are most of the buffets in Vegas, but worth it! They have this shrimp and lobster tail medley which always has a line. \n\nWe signed up for this text message service that texts us a couple times a week to get deals on things in Vegas. We ended up saving 10$ off each person at this buffet. \n\nDefinitely look for coupons before going. Would definitely recommend this place if you're a lover of seafood."
1,"this is a beautiful casino, but unless you are dressed like you have thougsands of dollars to spend, don't expect any service or any room at the tables."
1,"this casino is under construction.  not just a little - a LOT.  the casino that is actually open is like a sad depressing version of what vegas *should* be.  don't listen to whoever says the upgraded area is nice.  it's not.  it's a cheap IKEA version of what a real casino is.  anyone with an eye for cheap knock-offs can tell you that.  \n\nmy bf and i arrived late on friday night, and i thought we'd definitely stay around the casino and get buzzed and go bed before 3am, but after surveying what was available to do at the quad, we realized that staying there would be WORSE than not having come to vegas at all.  i think my boyfriend said something like \""if we stay and gamble here tonight i'll end up crying into my beer\""  we RAN AWAY to the mirage ASAP.\n\nthe hotel is disgusting.  i thought for sure we just didn't stay in an upgraded room, but after having read the other reviews - i think we actually did.  i. can't. believe. that.  and i'm not a picky girl.  i think i was in an upgraded room because the sheets were white.  apparently that's the upgrade?????  \n\nokay - the hotel gets one star for existing.  it gets two stars because the bed is actually comfortable.  the upgraded sheets are nice.  HOWEVER,  *every* other aspect of the room is terrible, and motel 6 beats it hands down - except for the bed.  i'm surprised we didn't find used needles on the carpet.  this place is like horror movie.\n\nmy bf has stayed at imperial palace many times before, and always says it's a great value because who spends time in their rooms in vegas?  even he was disgusted with the state of this place and thought they were letting the \""old\"" rooms go before they upgraded them.  unfortunately he was wrong.  that's just how they are.\n\nusually i console myself knowing that i saved a buttload of cash by staying in a cheaper but not as nice place, but after this experience, i think it's better to pay up."
1,"Not a fun experience at this IHOP.  What wrecked it for me was bringing my kid there before school to get breakfast and finding out AFTER the food has been delivered that they are not accepting IHOP gift certificate cards because their computer is down and has been down for a month.  REALLY?  Right after the holidays?  I call baloney on this.\n\nThe server said \""Oh there is a sign in the front that says we aren't taking gift cards...\""   Well we looked for the sign and guess what?  It was not on either of the double sets of doors when you walk in.  It was a plain paper sign attached to the cash register.  Now who the hell is looking there when you walk in?  Can somebody say lame??  I can.  LAME!\n\nThe food was average.  The service was underwhelming.  Avoid."
2,"We do love the Stetson chop, it is so good!!!\n\nOrder out, same great food without the wine at triple the price. TRIPLE!!!"
1,"There's no will call.  Even if you buy tickets online, you still have to wait in the same line with people who are trying to purchase tickets.\n\nThere's no doubt that this is a high dollar production.  The ticket price starts from $69.  Had I paid that amount, I would consider that well deserved.  But I paid close to $160 per ticket, and I didn't think that the show justified that amount.\n\nThe audience was moving about the theater throughout the entire show.  The show also allows people to roll in late.  I found that very distracting.\n\nThe show is artistic, but some parts were boring.  The story didn't flow well.  This is my first Cirque Du Soleil.  I would never go to one again."
0,"Over priced, bad portion size, lousy atmosphere!  Menu is ridiculous not sure what kind of restaurant this is. Way overpriced!"
1,"As far as revitalizations go, it is nice, but I wish that they had done more than make it a suburban strip center paired with an exurban cluster of parking lots.  Isn't the entire point of Urban Revitalization to bring in a more pedestrian friendly atmosphere?  I always thought it was.  It is not about creating more sprawl.  \n\nYes, the new Boxes that have been plopped down are nice due to the context within; but this is far from something to sings odes of joy about.  We don't need any more glorified, \""luxury\"" strip centers.  I agree with Jean K's assessment of the situation entirely.  This design was just plopped in place and the only local flavor is the bridge that was present.  Where is the thought?  Where is the design?   We can see this Anywhere, USA.\n\nHaving said that, though, I will return because the Waterfront does house certain big box retailers that you can't find in Pittsburgh Proper.  I really wish they had created a less suburban scheme and more contextual and conceptual design."
0,"The food is mediocre and so are the drinks. I don't drink beer but this seemed so popular. Worse then the food & watered down drinks was the horrible horrible service. My food took forever only to find out it had been given accidentally to another table who ordered the same thing. And had recently arrived. It happens,  but my waitress didn't seem apologetic and my food didn't get to me until over an hour after I arrived. I had ordered their garlic cheese bread which was just a thin crust cheese pizza with no pizzaz. \n\nI really wanted to avoid heading to Yelp about my awful experience as I contacted them directly two weeks ago right after my experience. Needless to say I got no reply, no apology, nada.\n\nWill never go back."
0,"The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didn't get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, \""ok, time out! I'm the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues.\"". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it, and after telling the girl, she said, \""I thought you said...\"". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"
2,"There are so many good pizza places popping up around here! Pizza Sola is a good option when you are looking for a quick slice, and service is decent. It used to be my favorite, and I still come here often, but it is no longer my go-to pizza place. When they first open for the day, the slices are nice and fresh, but you can tell when they've been there for a while. They do have some great combinations though that you don't find at the other places, and a better selection of white pizzas."
2,"This place is not too bad; haven't tried many Hawaiian food places while I've been here except for the marketplace cafe in the California hotel, and the lnl on S. Maryland. Out of all three, this was prob the furthest from tasting like the food from back home. I got the local plate which consisted of 2 spam musubis, Mac salad, and Teri chxn/beef.\n\nMusubis: they were okay, but nori and spam were quite soggy prob due to the over use of Teri sauce\n\nMac salad: not that great..lacked flavor and had a salty base..texture of noodles were nice and firm though! \n\nTeri chicken: usually Teri chxn is bbq'd or something..but idk, the one from here was fried (I'm guessing) which I found interesting, and it was covered with gooey overpowering Teri sauce, which was extra sweet and salty  \n\nTeri beef: same as the chicken in terms of that gooey overpowering Teri sauce..the texture of the beef was good though \n\nOverall this place was literally not bad nor was it good. Lol. I mean nothing can compare to food back home, but honestly I would prob goto lnl or the California for better stuff !"
4,"We got delivery from Foodie Call, so I can't speak for the atmosphere or service, but this was one of the best NYC-style pizzas I have had in or out of NYC. Good stuff!"
1,"Recently went to 5Church on a Saturday evening. Was excited to try this place, and have heard good things. Our reservation was late...8:30pm. I guess because of the hour this place felt more like a club, than a restaurant. At any rate the atmosphere was pretty cool and we were immediately shown to our table. We ordered cocktails. I was excited for a dirty martini because this place looked like they would know their way around a cocktail. The rest of my party (6 total) ordered cocktails, and in about 10 minutes another server was back with our drinks. He was pretty confused and had messed up most of my orders. One martini came with no olives, and my friends scotch was served with a lime...which was new. They fixed our drinks and we took a look at the menu. I had a steak. Everyone was asked what temp to cook their steak at, except me. It was so loud I just didn't think about it till my steak came and it was practically still mooing. I needed it to be about medium. They took it back, and everyone else ate while I waited for my meal to be re-fired. When it got back to me it was just OK. A little tougher than you would hope from a 40.00 steak. The mashed potatoes were good, and the gorgonzola cream sauce that accompanied the steak was also yummy...heavy, but that was to be expected. After dinner we ordered dessert. We chose the chocolate flourless cake. This was the most disappointing dessert I have ever had...ANYWHERE. The waitress brings the dessert knowing that everyone at the table wanted a taste, and it is literally the smallest thing I have ever seen. The entire dessert measured 1/2 inch high, and 1.5 inches long. Not even enough for everyone to have a small bite. It was almost as if they had run out...and gave us scraps. \nI won't go to 5church again. Me and my husbands total was 210.00 and we both agreed we would have been happier, and fuller if we had dined somewhere else."
4,"This is the best Mexican food restaurant I've eaten at in the Phoenix area. Their salsa and chips are outstanding. I order the ground beef tacos every time I come here. The service is friendly and attentive with no signs of  \""attitude\"" which detracts from many Mexican restaurants around here."
0,"BIRTHDAY FOR HUBBY UGH\nFirst of all I booked this on Priceline, I booked a room with a separate living space. It did not happen that way at checkin. WE WERE actually given a standard room.\n\nWe also called the hotel directly on May 10th, to verify the bedding would be hypo allergenic (no goose or down at all), I requested a fridge for a medical need, and a baby crib too. I was also promised a beech credit of 50. I recorded the call to verify all was ready to go.\n\nWe selected the M BAY for the pools, shark reef exhibit, and the it being on the end of the strip, with the boys. \n\nWhen we arrived it took one hour and thirty minutes to check in. No help with our bags. After the checking in the issues and more concerns piled up, only to not be resolved in a timely manor, or only after asking for the same item more than once. If it even was resolved at all.\n\n\nThe standard room, was dirty.\n1. Hair on bed and pillows.\n2. Toilet had number 2 stains in it.\n3. Snack tray was there, but item was open gross I am hoping no charge for that.\n4. Wrong bedding\n5. there was no way I was going to stay in the wrong room either.  I spoke to the main desk. who promised us help quickly. \nWe Waited for the agent we spoke to to come move us he did not?\n6. We called guest services again and then were told to hold by Rachel. She spoke To agent one and said he actually would not move us right away and that the wait was not too bad, and then stated the first agent had to get permission from the supervisor to help us. However he did not and was unable to call us back in the whole forty minutes we waited.\n3. All of a sudden the crib shows up, and he tries to put it in the room. Unfortunately that is when I called back to the desk, as we were moving rooms or so I thought. \n\nTHE SECOND ROOM WAS WORSE.\n1. The view was nice, but that's all.\n2. It was still the wrong room, as it had no king and no separate bed for the kids, no living space, and no baby crib, or fridge, \n3. Dirty headboard with white fluid on it? I have the pictures. The room smelled like smoke, and would have to wait for bedding to be changed. \n4. Called and spoke to The only assistant night manager, who was awful his name was TREA, (Trey).\n\nHE WANTED TO JUST HAVE US WAIT IN THE FILTH AND HAVE A MAID EVENTUALLY CLEAN THE ROOM. I WAS NOT ABLE TO ALLOW THAT WITH OUR  KIDS AND US. THE ROOM WAS REALLY NOT CLEAN AND WAS IN ITS OWN RIGHT A HEALTH HAZARD. WE WERE EVEN TOLD TO STORE MEDS IN MINI BAR.\n\n\nANOTHER ISSUE, we took our bags to the bell desk as the assistance never came to the room to help load them. I was so upset I ended up talking to TK as I refused to talk to TREA. He had us store our bags at the bell desk.We then had to leave our bags at the bell desk while again they tried to fix the room cleanliness issue, and get us into the correct the room. I brought down my iPad to guest services and showed TK the booking to make sure it would run smoothly. He said it would be correct and that the crib and fridge would be in the room and cold when we got back. The only thing is we would have to have call down for our luggage when we get back to the room later. All of this took at least another hour and a half if not more.\n\nROOM THREE - WORSE YET AFTER RETURNING AT TEN AT NIGHT, \nwe came back to the room only to be shocked by just a king bed. where does my older son sleep!  Where does the baby sleep. \n\n NO BABY CRIB NO FRIDGE. WE HAD JUST REPLACED THE MEDS FROM CVS.  Which one expensive fix. It was still the wrong room. I called down to guest services again, and was told they can't get another room right now, but could get us or correct room tomorrow. They left us in a jam and we were forced to take the room as is. Tub was dirty too. The baby crib did not show up after three calls and closer to midnight, and the rollaway bed that was promised for our older son never came. The fridge came before the baby crib at 11:39 PM. I was very upset at this point. \nAs soon as the baby bed came, everyone crashed. My poor husband in a chair as we did not have enough beds for us. A great way to spend his birthday trip sleeping, waiting and asking for help with issues. \n\nTHE FORTH ROOM, \nFINALY THE CORRECT ROOM, MY HUSBAND HIMSELF MOVED US IN WITH WHAT HE COULD CARRY AND WAITED FOR THE REST OF OUR LUGAGE TO ARRIVE. he waited forty minutes. The fridge never came, the baby bed had to asked about two times, but the room was right. Crappy view beyond what vegas should have, literally faces another wall, and when you look down there is a ton of pipes and bird poop. AGAIN I HAVE A PICTURE. \n\n\nHERE IS WHAT WE WRE PROVIDED\n\nCRAPPY FLOOR SERVICE WHILE AT THE CASINO, got one drink in two hours plus.\n\nA SHARK REEF VISIT ON THEM, AND a 100 dollar credit. We also requested a late check-out do to our super late check-in and all the room changes. \n\nIT IS NOT WORTH IT TO STAY HERE. I WOULD RATHER GO TO THE RIO, or the hard rock.\n\nWE want is a complete refund of time, to book someplace else without stress. \nLOVE RIO!"
2,"I usually visit this store if I'm looking for something pretty specific regarding clothing, housewares, or luggage.  It is actually not a bad store to visit... everything is kept pretty orderly and you can almost spend hours here if you are really shopping.  Having an older sister, I can locate the benches and places to sit at department stores pretty quickly... but Kohl's has a good mix of guys and gals stuff so you can walk around and browse instead of finding a place to park your behind.\n\nSome of the items can tend to run on the expensive side, but they do have a good clearance rack and you can find deals (just have to take the time to look for them).\n\nEvery now-and-then the cashier line goes down the asile, but they do a pretty good job of keeping the line moving (most of the time).  I do have one semi-bad memory at this store where I thought it would be a great idea to get a couple of pillows on sale for Black Friday.  BAD IDEA.... everyone apparently had the same idea, if not more and I pretty much got elbowed by a grandma on a mission to get her Black Friday money's worth."
1,"The crepe was ok, and the waffles were ok, the ice cream topping was delicious...overall the food was good for the price...although it did take a long time to get 1 crepe & 1 waffle dish considering we were the only customers during that time...well whoever was working behind the counter did not seem like he was too happy to be there anyways....maybe he had a bad hangover from EDC the night before...and of course he was the only one there...but nevertheless...if I have a craving again for butter cinnamon sugar crepes I know where I can get o\none....uhmmm kinda fast...."
4,"My husband and I love this place!!!  All of the ingredients are fresh and organic.  The staff is super friendly.  The great thing about My Pie is they don't charge you per topping, so you can build your own pie with as many toppings as you want!  My favorite is the MY Greek Pie, but we've ordered several different pizzas and they've all been delicious!!!  I highly recommend this place to everyone!!  And they have great beer and wine prices all day, every day!"
0,"This store seems to be very hit and miss. I had ordered a 2 tiered wonder woman cake and it was perfect and I loved it. If it had been that experience alone I would have given them 5 stars but unfortunately it is not. I also ordered a lady gaga cake and this one missed the mark. The fondant it's lumpy and the piping it's extremely uneven. When I called to voice my disappointment the decorator Jay would not have it. He changed the cake was perfect and that if I wanted a specific look I should have agreed for it.  I will post pictures of the cake and what I feel the problem areas are. Sadly, I will find a new cake shop BC of his reaction and the quality.\n\n**UPDATE 8-6-14**\nSomeone from KAK has been harassing me on Yelp sending me messages as to question the validity of my statements. Claiming that I must have left the cake in the sun or that for some reason the quality of the cake is my own fault. Truth is I was unable to confront Jay face to face because I was uncomfortable with that but made sure to call him as soon as I left the store. The cake was kept cool under the AC in my brand new car and at no time had extreme exposure to the AZ heat. Jay had told me that the fondant was still soft because he had just finished the cake, mind you I ordered it nearly a month in advance. Never will I ever deal with this establishment and I will make sure that no one I know will go to this place."
4,"Stack is awesome!!!\n\nWe ate here a few years ago and discovered the adult tater tots.  Oh.Em.Gee.  Wow, that just makes Ore Ida seem like a waste of a potato!  We made sure to order them again this time and once again, they had our eyes rolling back in our heads!!  So good!\n\nI ordered the pineapple mojito before I realized it was $20- yikes! But I'm glad I did b/c it was delicious!!!!!  Our entire meal was too for that matter.  \n\n-I went w/ the lamb ribs- they were extremely tender, super flavorful and the sauce that was all over them was rich and complimented the dish perfectly.\n\n-My husband got the filet and it was cooked absolutely perfectly and practically melted in your mouth.  Any steak that doesn't taste like this is a disservice to the cow!\n\n-My brother in law got the spaghetti w/ meat sauce and said it was wonderful- they didn't skimp on the meat sauce either, it looked rustic and tasty.\n\n-My sister in law got a medley of things- the gourmet pigs in a blanket, the tater tots, and the twice baked potatoes- all got two thumbs up from her as well.\n\nEverytime we've got there its half empty- and I have no idea why- this place is fantastic!  But its nice that we don't ever have to wait to get a table."
0,Horrible service and the food is over priced.

3,"We have always loved Oreganos, but my wife was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy.  Many pizza places in the valley now have gluten free crust options.  Oreganos, please get with the times and add a gluten free crust option!!"
1,"I'm conflicted about my review. I would give it a 2.5. The parking is terrible like everyone says. The salsa was really good. The live music was a nice touch. The food was just OK. I have had better Mexican food and I've had worse. I'm always suspicious of a Mexican restaurant when it is chock full of White people and no, or very few Mexican-Americans. \n\nMy husband liked his shrimp dish, but my pork dish was meh, unmemorable. I took home most of it and gave it to my husband. He will eat almost anything. I would not order a pork dish there again. \n\nI don't know if we will be going back again, definitely not at a busy time when parking is difficult."
1,"This is my second time coming to this location in a month. Its right there w/ where I regularly get gas during lunch. You would think that w/ it being right next to Carowinds and its the summertime that it would be faster during lunch time . \n\nToday's visit was not any different. They only had one person taking orders at 12:30 and the drive thru had like 4 cats waiting for orders to be taken. Workers behind the counter didn't know what people ordered so they were confused. \n\nIf this place wasn't connected to the gas station I like to use, I would go across the street to Subway or drive 5 min more to the McDs when I want a burger.  I mean prime location and they're taking advantage of people they know will come here because of their location."
1,"Craving a slab of juicy flavourful ribs I opted for 3 time world champion Memphis Champ BBQ. Unfortunately the meats were suprisingly dry, tough and often unexceptional. I sampled the wings(ok) the brisket (dry), ribs (reasonable) fried pickles(strange but good) , onion chips(very good)\n\nNice to get away from the maddening crowds, service was friendly and helpful, sadly food quality needs to be watched more closely."
2,"Remember having had a pretty good lunch here with a friend before a meeting but that we definitely had some sticker shock when the bill came. I had a turkey burger, not sure anymore with what but I tend to go towards spinach and feta or avocado and pepper jack, and she had a veggie burger, again can't remember for sure with what but she tends to go toward simple, and we shared the zucchini fries. We each had a sparkling water, and I think the bill was something like $50. For a couple of burgers and fries. I know it's a Hubert Keller restaurant and I know it's Vegas. I'm a foodie and I know you pay for the experience to dine at some of these spots. Still, for the money? Not sure I'm 100% sold."
1,"You know what Olive Garden is and so do I.  Despite being far from authentic, I typically enjoy their food about once or twice a year.  This time we had a gift card, so that was incentive enough to go.  They currently have a 2 for $25 which is okay, but the portions are a lot smaller than their regular entrees.  Yes, you get unlimited salad and breadsticks, but it's just iceberg salad.  The deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share.  It was enough for the price, but they should mention the portions are reduced.  Contrary to LR's review, I have ALWAYS taken leftovers home from OG.  I easily ate the whole entree after eating salad and breadsticks.  Unless they just reduced their portion size since the last time I went, these were definitely skimpy and did not come with that much chicken either.  The smoked chicken was decent.\n\nOur friend got the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks for dinner (yes they offer it for dinner for $3 more) but our less than friendly waitress snagged 2 of her breadsticks off of the table before she was finished. Why would you snag breadsticks from right in front of someone in the first place, let alone someone who has them as part of their meal. The spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth.  \n\nAll in all, it's not that good and there are better places you could go and not have to wait 45 minutes for a table.  Try a real, local Italian place, like Libretto's up the road or Portofino's on Park Rd.  Their dishes are made by real Italian people, not dreamed up in a corporate kitchen, and they give you your money's worth.  \n\nDrive 5 minutes to Libretto's for real Italian food or 10 minutes to The Carolina Bistro."
4,This show was as good as advertised!  It takes real talent for Mac King to do both comedy and magic in one show. I went too the show on July 7th and just loved it! A lady sitting next to me took part in the show on stage and she was just cracking up!  The Cloak on Invisibility was just hilarious!!!!!!! This show is great for people of all ages! I will have to see it again sometimes soon! The Staff at Harrah's was very helpful as well. I had lost my prepaid tickets to the show (was taking photos of the pool entrance to the Wynn and the folder I had my tickets in blew off) and they hooked me up with some new ones since I still had my receipt.  Mac King was genuinely friendly after the show and it was only $10 for him to sign the photograph that Harrah's takes mandatory of everyone before the show.
4,"Bet Pierogies around!! Great traditional Pierogies as well as plenty of creative offerings!!! \nWant somehting really creative, try the PIErogies.....Like cherry cheesecake, or Bavarian cream!! OMG!! Just try them once and you'll be hooked!!!"
2,It's a great place. They make you feel gpod.
1,"No way, dudes. Go down the street and get some tastier food at Tram's Kitchen. The grub is better, the restaurant itself is a little cleaner (not saying much on either account), and the water even tastes better. \n\nReally. I'm not joking about the water."
3,"Found this place from one of the menus they left on my apartment door. I'm usually skeptical of places that do that but I was feeling sick and really wanted some wonton soup so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. I got there and decided to order a small chicken chow mein as well. It also came with white rice which was nice since many places charge extra for rice. The chow mein was awesome, not overly greasy or salty, and the chicken in it was really good quality. The biggest problem I have with many Chinese restaurants is poor-quality fatty chicken (and other meats) but this was delicious white meat. The wonton soup was also great, not too salty like some places, and the wontons were delicious as was the pork inside of them. Overall, if I'm looking for some relatively inexpensive Chinese food, I would definitely go back."
2,"Hard to get seating on Saturday and the noise level is high. Nice atmosphere and the staff are very friendly and good at what they do. The scallop appetizer and salads were good. I had issue with the pasta and you cant have issues with pasta in an italian restaurant.  The marinara sauce was too much tomato tasting acidic and lacked balance. The spinach ravioli was too much cheese and cream, again not balanced. This place has all the elements of a good dining experience but the kitchen needs to up the game for my taste."
3,"I don't feel like Sundance is that much more expensive than other movie theaters, and even if it were, I would gladly pay more to not have to listen to other people talk during a movie. In Austin we have the Alamo Drafthouse, where talkers and texters get the boot instantly, but alas, they have not opened up a branch in Madison. Sundance is a pretty close second though. Although they do not have servers that come to your seat, take your order, and bring you your food, they do have a cafe outside in the lobby where you can order food and drink and take that to your seat. I like their reserved seating system, and the seats are pretty comfortable and recline a little bit. My favorite theater in the Madison area, hands down."
2,"Tons of beer if that's your thing... full bar too.  No cocktail menu to speak of, and only a few food items on the menu.  Felt like kind of a basic, no frills place, which can be a good thing sometimes.  \n\nWe were there in late December at night and all the doors were open with no heating... not sure why that was, but wear a coat if you're going to hang out indoors here in the cooler months.  Freezing cold, tried using the candles on the table to keep warm, not so efficient... so we only stayed for one drink and bounced."
1,"I cannot see why anyone would give such great reviews for this restaurant. There is not much to choose from in Fountain Hills, so that might explain the raves. Notice there are no real pictures of the restaurant on their website. There is a good reason, the interior is small, dark and cold, both in temperature and decor with maybe 8 tables. The bulk of the seating is outdoors and if eating on the sidewalk is your thing, then this might be your place.\n\nThe food is okay, it's a tapas place so you expect small plates and prices to go along with it. When portions and prices are not comparable, the word pricey comes to my mind. However, they do have wonderful multigrain breads, the freshest salads and deliciously brewed coffee.\n\nMaybe we tried it on a bad day, but I would say the service was less than spectacular. We actually had to get up and walk to the door in order to get our check.\n\nFrom our experience, there is nothing here to draw us back."
2,"I've been craving a cupcake for the past 2 weeks, Let Them Eat Cake pop up on my Yelp app after I search for cupcakes and off I went. The store is tiny, but there's a pretty big variety of cupcakes. It was difficult to chose but I finally settled on Boston Cream Pie, Red Velvet, Oreo and CCC. \nLet me say that the presentation is beautiful and more than cupcakes, these are mini-cakes. I was pleasantly surprised and didn't felt as bad paying $3.25 for a cupcake:) Now, taste wise, they were good, not amazing. The cake part was on the dry side, too dry for my taste actually. There's a lot of frosting so it kinds of compensate for the dryness.\n\nMy favorite was the Oreo cupcake but halfway through it I had to stop as I was getting queasy with all the frosting and sweetness. Best bet is to share them!"
1,"good ambiance, iffy wine (the house was better than the listed wines) and the cheese was not appropriate as spreadable and quite frankly the bread was bad. stay for 1 drink and move on."
4,"This place is not just a hotel to stay at but an entire experience.\n\nI frequent Las Vegas quite a bit and have always left feeling like my trip was missing something. I've stayed at all of the \""well known\"" high-end hotels and for one reason or another they never met my expectations. Well, all of this changed upon walking into the Cosmopolitan for the first time.\n\nImmediately you are transported into the Cosmopolitan universe as you reach the lobby and stand there in awe of what they pulled off. It's like nothing else you have ever seen. From that point on throughout the rest of my stay I could not find one crack in the veneer of the Cosmopolitan experience.\n\nThe rooms are immaculate, the staff is professional & courteous, and the hotel provides you with everything you would ever need. I realize that the price of a room here may not fit into everyone's budget however if you are looking to truly treat yourself and are headed to Las Vegas - I very strongly encourage you stay here.\n\nYou will not leave disappointed. I can't wait to go back."
3,The food was excellent as was the service. However it is hard to hear as the acoustics were not so good. The owner came by the table and told us it was going to be fixed in the winter.  Highly recommend this restaurant
1,"I hate to give this bar and grill such a low rating, but the past few times I have been there, the service has been awful. My (now ex) girlfriend and I stood for 15 minutes waiting for the waitress to come and seat us. This would not have been such a problem had it not been 10 PM and there were only 2 tables with people at them. As far as food goes, it's not bad. Basic bar food, minus the pepper jack burger which is amazing. I will probably not be coming back to this location."
2,"I will feature the State I've called home for the past few years for my 1900th review.  Here's a breakdown of this State:\n\nPro's\n+ Warm weather.  The Southern part of the State is warm for the majority of the year...sure beats shoveling snow and wearing layers of clothing.\n\n+ Sports.  There are a ton of sports in this State.....college, pro's (NFL, MLB, NBA, WNBA, NHL, Arena Football), Fiesta Bowl, Phoenix Open (golf), Spring Training Cactus League.\n\n+ Scottsdale.  I love living in this city.  It's safe and fun.  A great place to raise a family.\n\n+ They have frequent gun shows.  It seems like there's one every month.  The gun laws here are not very strict and gun enthusiasts are everywhere.  I've come to appreciate guns a lot since I've moved here.\n\n+ Hiking options.  There are a lot of hiking trails in the State with a nice variety of landscape.  From mountains and pine trees to dry Sonoran Desert dirt and Saguaro cacti, there's something for everyone here.\n\n+ Western lifestyle.  There are some places in Arizona where you feel like you're in the Wild West.\n\n\nCon's\n- State Income Tax.  Coming from a state that had no state income tax, it's hard to swallow the fact that we have to pay a % of our income to the State.\n\n- Politics.  There's so much politics here and it carries over into everyday life.\n\n- Drivers.  The drivers here in Arizona are baffling.  They slow down BELOW the speed limit for no reason on the highways.  People rubberneck over the dumbest things.....cars pulled over on the shoulder, cops on the side of the road, curves in the freeway.\n\n- Slow life.  Stores, restaurants, bars close early here.....yawn.  I get bored very easily out here.\n\n- Lack of good Asian food.  Can't find very many good Pho or Ramen places.\n\nOverall, it's not too bad a place to live.  I've lived in more exciting places, but it could be worse.  It's definitely worth visiting if you've never been here before."
3,"This is by far my favorite Chick Fil A in the Charlotte area.   No matter what time of day I go in, the staff are always super (and I mean like crazy, super, wtf nice).  Food is always hot and ready quick.   I would suggest not going right at 12:00pm for the lunch rush cause it gets super packed.\n\nThe kids that work at this store must be the pride and joy of their parents.   To be honest, it almost scares me how nice they are.    I am not going to lie, I have driven off a couple of times with an eerie pit in my stomach after a SUPER DUPER FRIENDLY interaction......\""thank you sir it was a pleasure to serve you this morning, I hope you have a great day\"".........EEEK!"
0,"I figured this place would be like Fat Tuesday's, but I was wrong.  The drinks are weak and too sweet.\n\nI tried the Pina Coloda and it tasted like there was a cup of sugar in it."
2,Very loud 80s music!   The turkey burger was good and the space pigs are awesome!  Our waitress was friendly and did her best to accomodate my special request as a non-red meat eater.
2,"I debated between 2 stars versus 3 stars but decided on 3 because it has beautiful and interesting stuff but it's just way overpriced and this is coming from someone that spends good money on her home decor. I wish I could come up with more details than this but that's just sort of it. I mean, if you have plenty of money to use up then shop here. Eh, I guess that's harsh; maybe for like the perfect one of a kind thing shop here but prepare to spend like 70% more than what it's worth."
0,"I have visited this store twice and BOTH times they were out of extra crispy recipe....ok you advertize that you have it you would think that at dinner time you would make sure that it is available... I know it is popular so I would think you would keep it up. Next the macaroni was mush, I asked for corn on cob.. they no longer have it? and the biscuits were nothing but raw flour dough in the center!!  pay attention ppl! you are serving the public.. although I realize this store is on the border of Apache Junction.... it's no excuse !!!!"
3,"A very classy Irish bar. Plenty of TVs and one projector screen for watching games. Good selection of about 15 European beers. Very quality bar food, I've had about half the menu and haven't been disappointed yet, but it's not going to blow you away by any stretch. The waitress staff is spotty with service, they seem to go in the back to the cooking area and stay awhile for no apparent reason. I would stick to sitting at the bar if possible. They have bands here on Thursday and Saturday and if you don't mind how loud they are, then it can be fun."
2,"I came here with two friends claiming that this was the best experience ever and I did not see it that way. It was an over glorified hamburger/cheeseburger joint that had pretty good hamburger/cheeseburgers and possibly the worst fries in existence. I guess if you're the nostalgic type and you miss the olden days then it might take you back but other than that I really don't understand the hype. Don't even get me started on \""the secret menu\"" which is even more overrated than In-N-Out itself.\n\nIf I happen to find myself stranded on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere and the only place to eat/drink was an In-N-Out burger I would eat there to save my life but I wouldn't tell anyone about it."
0,"I spoke with the owner of this location. He tried to bully me into changing my YELP review. And the fact that he flagged my review shows that he can't take the TRUTH! You can't bully me into changing my review that was truthful. You called my husband and I a liar, I will never support your business. You are the reason your location has such awful reviews! The fact is we received AWFUL SERVICE!!! And the response we received from the owner was AWFUL!!! I will not support this business with their AWFUL customer service!!!!!!!! I will take my money across the street to PANDA!!!!!! \nUpdate: Sure, you update your review Dean, I already contacted you and you were rude and disrespectful. You didn't apologize you accused me of working for Panda. So keep your fake \""contact me\"" I already did and all we got was anger from you. You spent the whole conversation talking about Panda instead of focusing on your store issues. If the foundation is shaky the house will fall down. You're the foundation of that business...i.e. bad customer service, bad management!"
0,"If you're under 21 don't even wast your time. \n\nWe use to come here a lot. It's been a few months and we were craving steak close to the house. We had our 10 year old with us. After waiting 5 minutes for some one to seat us we were greeted with \""sorry it's only 21 and up\"". I clarified that we are eating not going to the bar he told us it was the whole place.   This was after we waded through a horrible stench outside. So BEWARE!"
1,Meh. Skip this place. The service was so apathetic. I just needed to buy a few sheets of paper from the copy center. The guy behind the counter really couldn't care less about helping me. Supposedly they were out of the paper I was looking for and he just shrugged his shoulders at me. I will not be returning to this location in the future and I would recommend taking your business elsewhere.
1,"I have an INTENSE hatred for people telling me to pull around the drive thru and wait for my food to be ready. To me, this means, \""move along loser, you're inconveniencing us; even though you paid us, and waited in line for everyone else, you need to get out of line, and go wait till we're not busy enough to bother bringing your (typically cold) food out to you. That said, when people tell me to do this (typically happens at this Burger King), I put the car in park and tell them politely that I'll wait. This freaks them out, and they practically insist I move because I'm holding everyone else up behind me. I'm not trying to be a dick; I don't order 30 burgers at the drive thru. They make the BK Big Fish sandwich fresh and it takes an extra 2 minutes (yes I timed it). They're just trying to keep their drive thru times down because they're monitored and penalized if they are too high.\nO.K... Rant out of the way, I have to say that when I go in, everyone is polite and helpful. The restaurant is always clean, and quiet. The food is ALWAYS fresh, and hot. You can order lunch early in the morning, and the soda is never flat. This is why the store gets 2 stars instead of 1. Honestly, I'd rate the in store experience a 4/5 and the drive thru experience a 1/5, because they are incapable of understanding drive thru orders without repeating them 2-4 times for each item, and you can FORGET about asking for details on items. Anything you ask about, they just add to your order without explanation, even though you may not want it. Add to it, the above issue, with the lack of give-a-damn for the drive thru customers, and we have a pretty \""meh\"" store.\nStep up the drive thru customer service Burger King!"
3,Any place that serves fried pickles at least gets three stars from me. The Penquin is a small resturant on the north side of Charlotte. The key word there is small my girlfriend and I waited to eat for 55 minutes if not longer (I stopped counting)... So was it worth the wait... Well since I don't live in Charlotte it wouldn't have been worth a trip just to eat here. However if your in Charlotte the food is cheap and very good... Another reason it wouldn't be worth the trip is if you live any where in the united states then chances are you have a burger shop just as good as The Penquin in your town. So I'm not going to go crazy and claim that The Penquin is anything other then a great little resturant with a ton of character. The true test of how good a place is if you'll comeback as for me all I can say is maybe.
4,"The best place on Mill. Consistently excellent pizza, salad, and bruschetta. Good wine selection and definitely a more sophisticated atmosphere than anywhere else. The pear salad is excellent. Wonderful service. Great value."
3,"Man I love me some wings! Plus, I never knew how great Wingstop was until I moved out here to AZ. \n\nI think the reason why I really love this place is for their selection. I enjoy the traditional hot flavor, but I'm also a huge fan of the lemon pepper and garlic parmesan. When my buddies and I come here, we always get the family meal, which comes with a GRIP of food for only about $28. \n\nYou get 35 wings (your choice of flavors), two large sides (we always just get double orders of fries), carrots/celery and 2 sides of ranch. And believe me, it's enough to FILL YOU UP!"
3,This place was good but not the you have to be careful about the temperature of the steak when you order..... Medium is really Medium Rare.
2,"This location is attached to the Galleria Mall off of Sunset.  It's kept very clean and organized.  There are two floors for shoppers to access the different areas of the mall.  \n\nFor me, Kohls has always been a hit or miss kind of stores.  Sometimes I can walk out with multiple bags while other days with zilch.  Thankfully when I do find something, it's always on sale.  If it's not on sale, I can usually find a coupon online.  \n\nCustomer service here was ok.  They definitely needed more registers open as the lines were longer than normal.  The cashier was friendly but again, just slow.  \n\nI've been to better locations but it's still ok."
1,"I love being greeted right when I walk in, that's one thing they got right. There was a man who said hello and asked what I needed before I made it all the way into the store, which was nice. \n  I told him I was thinking about phones and he added me to the wait list. Little did I know it was a 20 minute wait list! I told him I'd never had a smart phone before because I wanted to see what they would recommend to me. After my long wait someone finally started talking phones to me but I was shocked to find that the salesperson didn't tell me more about the phones other than how much they cost. I didn't mention I was on a budget. I was hoping he'd give me a run through of each phone and what they did , what makes this phone better than that one and so on but no such luck. I left with more questions than answers. Total let down."
4,"I have been going to Dr. Bilon for close to two decades.  This alone should speak volumes of my confidence in his ability.  Dr. Bilon and his staff are extremely detailed and take their time with you during a visit.  You will never feel rushed through an appointment.  \n\n I have had some major issues with my vision (detached retina in both eyes as well as cataracts).  Dr. Bilon directed me to specialists in the region who not only repaired my eyes, but worked with Dr. Bilon to make sure that my ongoing vision is better than 20/20.  Dr. Bilon also has corrected vision, so he understands how frustrating things can get when your vision isn't how you think it should be. It's always nice to have a doctor who has experienced what you are experiencing firsthand.  \n\nAt times Dr. Bilon can be conservative in his treatment or recommendation, but that is simply because of the importance that he places on your health and eyesight.  I trust Dr. Bilon and his staff without reservation and routinely recommend him to my friends.  God willing, I will still be seeing Dr. Bilon twenty years from now."
2,"The stadium itself is nothing special, but it gets the job done.\n\nLike other reviewers have wrote, its the people, the tailgating, and the Steelers of course that make the experience so well worth it."
3,"Came here for the tortas. Tried the Cuban torta, pollo tacos, pollo burrito, and ceviche tostadas. Oh can't forget the wonderful watermelon Aguas frescas. The Cuban torta was ham and cheese with Chinese BBQ pork, it was good. The burrito although small for a burrito was filled with pollo, salsa, avocados, and beans. This was pretty good except for the size, I would consider this not big enough for a meal. The pollo tacos were ok, simple enough.  But the star of the meal and unexpected winner, which in retrospect probably eclipsed the other meal components was the shrimp ceviche tostada, we got two large and they were incredible. Spicy and fresh and savory.  I could have had two of these and maybe a shrimp coctel. Well I'm assuming the shrimp coctel is wonderful also. Need to come back and try more sea food at this wonderful place."
3,"I am realllly happy we left New York, New York to stay at the Gold Coast!  I stayed here 17 years ago and they have put some serious money into updating all their rooms. As an interior designer I can see that they didn't spare any expense in updating this important feature!  Love the old school casino vibe. None of that trashy-hooker-look-at-me craziness you experience on the strip.  If your intention is to come to vegas and just get to some good gambling and low crowd levels, this is the section of vegas you want to hang in. My only dissatisfaction is the small low energy pool scene here. But if your looking for a quite space to absorb rays and cool your skin off, then this is the perfect pool scene for you. Go back to the basics!  Vegas is way better in the older parts of town then on that circus strip!!  Go somewhere you can have good energy and enjoy the people you are traveling with!"
1,"Wasn't too impressed about this place for the following reasons; canned soda, no fountain drinks? Well I'm going to be thirsty before I'm done because I'm certainly not going to order extra. I ordered the fajitas...can't go wrong with fajitas, right?! WRONG! Tortillas were 1/4\"" thick and still doughy on the inside. Meat was cut wrong, not grilled or fried yet saut\u00e9ed with tomatoes, bell peppers. Very saucy so I poured it over my rice and ate it that way. Although I would preferred to have it fajita style it was good this way. \nThe presentation was haphazard at best, if that was a salad with the rice as a side, it looked horrible. 1 sliced tomato, 1 sliced cucumber, 1 sliced radish!!! Really?!?\nYes I close with the fact that there are expectations that need to be met when you patronize a restaurant, I'm afraid they weren't met here today!"
1,"I had high hopes for this place.  Since the restaurant is located on busy Mill Avenue at a corner spot I assumed it had to be fantastic.  When you walk in the decor is of course asian themed and contemporary.  This joint tries to make Vietnamese food edible to novice palates.  Unfortunately, they fall short.  This is unfortunately as good as it gets.\n\nMy fiance and I took a seat on the outdoor patio to enjoy the great weather.  There were so many items on the menu and their website that looked and sounded appealing I didn't know what to try first.  This is what we had:\n\nSalt and Pepper Calamari - the breading was nice and light.  However the calamari was so so chewy.  It was seriously like chewing on an erasar.  I really didn't pick up any salt or pepper flavor either.  The dipping sauce was tasty tho.\n\nDragonfly Signature Spring Bowl with Charbroiled Chicken - My dish arrived with noodles, crispy egg roll and chicken.  It looked nothing like the pictures I saw.  Then a few minutes later our server came with the rest of the greens and vinaigrette.  After dressing up my dish, I expected to taste that authentic \""fish\"" sauce.  Dragonfly however, waters down their vinaigrette so the fish sauce is barely noticeable.  It's the tang and sourness of the sauce that brings tons of flavor to the dish and this dish was seriously lacking it.  I tasted the egg roll by itself and it tasted like it was old.  Blah!  It wasn't even wrapped nice and tight but instead was fried with one edge falling off.  I dunked it in the calamari sauce to hide the taste.\n\nDuring my dining experience on the patio, I had to swat off several bugs that were attacking my food.  A few I killed on my empty plates which was rather disgusting.  My bad for choosing to eat outdoors.\n\nI think Dragonfly has a lot of potential to be a great place.  They have a great location and decor.  Just need to work on taste and seasoning and I'm sure they'd be a hit."
2,"The house salad was very good actually. I liked the mix of greens and the dressing, the whole thing tasted fresh. I had a carnitas burrito which was good, bismati rice and sweet potato in side was a good flavor. I didn't really like the green salsa, it was more sweet than savory. I'd defiantly order this again but try a different salsa next time."
2,"Got take out from this place on the weekend.  Ordered kung pao chicken, steamed dumplings, and pork egg rolls.  I was really hungry so it hit the spot, but there wasn't that many chicken pieces in my kung pao chicken - a lot of peanuts (as expected) and a whole lot of celery and carrots (aka filler).  So I was a bit disappointed in that.  \n\nThe steam dumplings were good, especially when fresh and hot.  The egg roll was tasty as well - I didn't find it too oily.  Very affordable and a generous portion - I had the leftovers the next day."
0,"Two times now I've been to this location and they were not participating in advertised specials, and frankly I am just tired of it.\n\nIt would be nice if the corporate franchise would make franchisees post clearly if they are not participating in wide-range advertisements, but I've learned my lesson about this location. I won't be stuck in their drive through trying to get dinner for my kids again.\n\nI recommend any of the other locations in the area, I have never had this kind of difficulty anywhere else."
3,"Don't believe the hype. The bad reviews for the Flamingo buffet are unjustified, at least concerning dinner. I ate at the Paris buffet last night, and despite the latter's fancier atmosphere they are both on the same quality.\n\nThe food was good buffet food. There was  a nice vegetarian variety, and tasty desserts. Top marks for the delicious guacamole and strawberries + chocolate fountain!\n\nThe service was impeccable. My drink waited for me on the table when I came back from my first buffet round. The empty plates were cleared in good time and I was offered drink refills.\n\nAll in all I had a great dinner at this buffet, and would definitely come again."
4,I just had a great experience at Centennial Toyota. JJ helped me find just want I wanted and after working with Manny in the finance department I was able to also pay just what I wanted! Buying a car from JJ was great! He never pressured me and was honest and helpful from the moment we met.  JJ is the guy you want to ask for when you walk into Centennial Toyota. You will leave the lot with a smile from ear to ear; I certainly did!
1,"I got thrown out of the Griffin last night by the Samoan gang for agreeing with a woman's belief that her husband was engaged in some kind of weird homo erotic relationship with his friend.  So I walked up to the bar and ordered a drink when I walked in.  This lady sitting at the bar turned to me and complained that her husband and his buddy were all over each other.  I said \""So they are acting like they are each other's boyfriend?\""  She said, \""Yes. Exactly.\""  She put her hands on my face, gave me a kiss on the cheek, and walked out.  Her husband and his boyfriend run off chasing her.  The next thing I know, one of the bouncer is forcibly pushing me out the door.  I told the other bounce, a much larger Samoan guy, what happened and he just shrugged.  I hung out for a couple of minutes and waited for my friends to come out.  Oh well.  The place is getting way too hip for its own good.  Don't go to the Griffin unless you plan to sit there, take in the smoke, buy drinks, and keep your mouth shut."
0,"Food and service are not good.\n\nNot much else to say but it was just bad all around.  Our food order wasn't correct, the follow-up to resolve it was terrible, and the food when it came was overcooked and bland.  Instead of serving good food they just hope to win you over by shoving a ton of bad food in front of you."
0,"I used to go to Sam Woo when it first opened and always like the bbq pork fried rice and the sliced bbq pork which were always good.  I had to give the place a break after trying other dishes that weren't so great, and also because they have been closed several times by the health department. I've gone there when they had a B rating, and turned around and walked out.  Keep your eye on them, I think you can find the latest restaurant ratings in the RJ."
1,"Smells like poo, tastes like chicken!!!  This was my first time visiting Carrabba's (Cacabba's).  What a way to make a first impression.  There was a nasty odor coming from somewhere.  The odor greeted me when I walked up to the hostess stand.  We were seated close to the hostess stand and I could still smell it.  I don't mean to gross you out but it smelled like a poopy womens bathroom.  We asked for a different table.  Somewhere in the far back away from the entrance.  We did out run the smell and had our dinner.  I had the rigatoni.  Check please.  Our waitress was good.  She earned a star for this review."
1,"The food is bland which I guess is to be expected since it is English.  However, it was substance and not exspensive."
2,"I read a review just now that used the word 'uninspired'.  I would have to say that is exactly what I felt about my dining experience at Hyakumi.  The food is fine, but there is absolutely nothing unique or special to talk about.  The highlight of my meal was trying to predict which people walking by would touch the breasts hanging off of Cleopatra's Barge.  My girlfriend and I laughed about it so much that it is now a MUST DO for us every trip we take a trip to Vegas.\n\nThe location is inside of Caesar's Palace, just off of the casino floor and across from the aforementioned barge.  Park in Caesar's self-park for free or valet in front.  Walk or taxi if you are staying on the Strip."
2,Good Cafe inside the Luxor. Shared a Reuben Sandwich with fries and a cup of clam chowder.\n\nWe finished it all if that says anything more.\n\nThere's a discount coupon in your welcome package if you're staying in the hotel.
2,"It's good for what it is--Americanized Chinese food. There weren't too many traditional dishes on the menu. It was like a sit down Panda Express. Yep, it's good for what it is.\n\nI had the sesame chicken dinner combination, and it came with eggroll, some weird foil-wrapped chicken morsel, a crab puff and hot and sour soup. The hot and sour soup had way too much black pepper. My mom used to say that if you have to use black pepper in your cooking, you're cheating, cause you're hiding the food's natural flavor :P The chicken was decent.\n\nRyan had the walnut shrimp. It was NOT what I expected. It wasn't crispy, and the sauce had...coconut in it??? Ryan enjoyed it, but I couldn't really eat it. \n\nAfter this meal, I had to ponder why the crab puff is such a staple in Americanized Chinese food. There is absolutely no dairy in Asian cuisine, and we don't even bother with fake crab. And suddenly, here comes this crab-cream-cheese puff thing onto the menus of countless Chinese places...lol anyways off the tangent...\n\nAnyways, the lunch and dinner combinations are well-priced, and I wouldn't mind going back if someone else wanted to go, but I don't think I'll crave it again.\n\nThe service was REALLY nice though. The ladies were very sweet. For that reason, I really wished I could have liked the food more. \n\nI'm still looking for my go-to Chinese food place here in Phoenix...I need me some good dim sum, Hokkien Fried Rice, some garlic crab, pi pa tofu, squab, liver/kidney congee....*drool* My next stops will be Phoenix Palace and Great Wall...hopefully one of those will be awesome!"
1,"Deion was helpful and patient. I am usually uncomfortable learning about new devices because I am technically challenged, but Deion made me feel at ease.  I still need more help and I know I won't be nervous about seeking it.\nDonna"
4,Dr Sandee Patel is OUTSTANDING! One of the best doctors that I have ever had.
2,Fantastic lunch menu. My fav is BBQ Chicken pizza/house salad combo. Delicious!  \n\nTons of TVs around the bar. They label the TVs with what game will be on which is nice. Staff is awesome! \n\nLarge outside covered patio with a few heaters (though only one works now) and several TVs (small ones).
4,"Going to Pendeli's for the first time was a total fluke...my boyfriend and I were hungry, the fridge was empty and we were not in the mood to go to the grocery store and cook something ourselves so we set out to find a restaurant.\nWithout even knowing what we felt like eating, we drove around NDG. My Yelp app told me about this pizzeria, and suddenly, pizza was the only thing on our minds. We quickly drove there and once we stepped in, we knew...this was going to be epic.\nYou can generally tell the quality of a pizzeria based on their pizza cooking technique (conveyor belt oven vs actual pizza oven) My boyfriend was happy to see an authentic pizza oven! Then we watched their assembly of the pizzas...HOLY PEPPERONI BATMAN!!!\nInstead of slicing down to form circles, the pepperoni is cut lengthways to create long strips of awesomeness! And the bacon! OMG the BACON...actual strips of bacon instead of rolled up pieces of chewy nastiness that occurs on most of the pizzas around...\nThe ingredients are super fresh...we always get the Pendeli's special without anchovies or olives/vegetarian without olives.\nThe only way they could make their pizza better is by making chicken a topping choice...(we would add it to the veggie)\nWe tried the fries and the sub one time...both don't live up to their pizza.\nPIZZA PIZZA PIZZA...\nSo good...\nYou\nmust\neat\nhere."
2,"\""Worst service everrr.  I don't recommend this fake sushi bar to anyone... \"" is what i thought when i went there and they double booked the karaoke room.. i am still sore about that, because they did not offer all 25 of us any compensation at all. I have been there a couple times since, and i have not had a problem."
3,My mom watches this guy on TV. Bam! \n\nIts pretty good. We have never gotten past drinks and appetizers but we have been here a ton. Always busy. Drinks and apps are always good. It is in a good spot too. If you are a boxing fan its a great place to sit before the fight and have a quick drink. The atmosphere is OK (compared to the other over the top Vegas places its not great).
0,"I would give this zero stars if I could. I have been to about 20 shows at the Marquee over the past 6 years (never again), including working the Merch table at show. This is THE WORST venue I have ever been to! I can't express how much I hate the Marquee! Let me count the ways:\n\n1) Almost every time I've been, they have lost a ticket of mine at will call, or misplaced it, or don't have record saying I bought it. I have gotten so used to this that I bring a recite every time, and every time they just look bewildered and confused. Their will call/ticket sale line is so unorganized. And trust me, if there's a problem, it's always YOUR fault, not theirs. \n\n2) Security to get in is a little bit of a pain. You have to take off your shoes and usually give away everything you own, or make the long walk back to the car to put it away. Thing I've had taken away: gum, carabiner, small hair brush, tiny nail clippers, bag of pretzels, pens). It's just overkill. And the security are a bunch of ASSHOLES. I got knocked over during a show once, and I made eye contact with one of the big apes and he did nothing to help me up. He didn't even move. They are angry and mean. \n\n3) It's outrageously expensive to do anything there. Tickets come with the worst fees. It's now $7 for parking! (It used to be $5). Sodas, beers, drinks, and even water bottles are all overpriced. \n\n4) Most importantly, their sound is HORRIBLE! Jesus Christ, you're a Goddamn LIVE music venue for crying out loud! The audience should be able to hear the band they actually came to see! They are spending all the money on \""renovations\"" when they should be fixing their sound problem. \n\nDon't waste your money going to the Marquee. Now that venues like Crescent Ballroom exist, just wait for a good show there. The Marquee is a waste of money and only leaves you feeling angry and bummed out."
2,"I've been to this place twice now. The first time I wanted something non-caffeinated so I got a cherry italian soda. It was delicious, and the price was fine. \n\nLast week I needed a coffee to go and thought I'd give this place a whirl. I got a medium sized light roast and was horrified to see that the only option for creamer was the little individual-size International Coffee creamers that you see in restaurants sometimes. I was really surprised that a place whose main offering is coffee didn't have some sort of little pitcher or carafe with half-and-half or even whole milk. Even Kwik Trip (with their spelling issues) offers half-and-half from a dispenser. \n\nI didn't like the coffee much but I'm pretty sure I didn't add enough sugar and creamer, so I'm not knocking off any stars for that. I'll have to try it again some time to judge it better. \n\nIt used to be a small bank and has a wacky layout, but I think that's sort of fun and adds to the hometown/refurbished vibe."
1,"Chipotle is suppose to be a quick service type of thing right? Unless there's like a line of people who want to grub then it's not so fast, but that's TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE and kay. \n\nWhat's not okay is not being prepared for business and notttt knowing how to smile, be friendly, and handle weird situations such as what happened earlier. They ran out of brown rice and steak. Swear, we had a staring contest with them. My sister and I asked how long it will take and the employees told us 3 minutes for the rice and 5 for the steak. So we waited and didn't mind. We stood back in line and they said three more minutes. It's disappointing. Imagine you working a long day and have been amping up for good food to relax an chill only to come home to it being gone.\n\nBasically, the service we got today wasn't good. Unfriendly staff, unable to tell right timing for food, and incomplete stock of food. I'm still gonna go back because chipotle is yummy, but today was myeh."
2,"I had this a couple weeks ago late at night, it wasn't bad for $8 for an XL with ground beef. The fact that it is 24 hours is always a good thing."
1,"This airport needs some major.. something or other. \n\nI had a connecting flight to get to and had to run to the other side of Terminal 4. I thought I would be able to hit the bathroom before hand, but boy was I wrong. They are literally redoing every bathroom in the Terminal except 1. You know what that means ladies- lines all the way down the terminal. I wouldn't make it in time, so I had to suffer through take off until cruising altitude. It was not fun on a turbulent flight. \n\nThe seats are not upgraded in the terminal like many other airports. There are not any plug-ins in convenient locations, like the arm rests (in other airport terminals). There are only plug-in's in the middle of walkway between the row of chairs. The people in the terminal are kind and just step over, etc. The pilots and crew members on the other hand, not so much. I had my phone charger ripped out of the ground by not 1 but 2 different crew attendants that proceeded to roll over the cord anyway. I wasn't that upset about it, I just thought it was funny that there were tons of other rows to walk down, but they kept choosing mine! haha. \n\nI'm not a fan of this one! But I will inevitably be back because I hate the drive to AZ more."
3,"Nice and clean. Get a room ending with a low number or ask for one away from the freeway. Breakfast was adequate, not too bad. Fahed at the front desk was able to find a cooler for us to use on a day trip to Sedona. Much appreciated! Would stay tree again!"
3,"This is a quick and easy version of their sister restaurant; PF Changs. Place your order. Dishes are broken down with your choice of meats or tofu, take your number, sit down, and in a few minutes they bring you your perfectly stir fried fresh and yummy meal. It's also cheaper and it has a theater style kitchen so you can sit and watch the chefs make your meal if you like. Cheap, yummy, easy, fresh, and vegetarian if you so choose."
0,"Disgusting! Do not stay here!\n\nIt was very clear the room they put us in was not clean. The sheets were filthy and stained. \n\nIf everything else in the area is booked, do yourself a favor, go somewhere else."
2,"I love margaritas and they are pretty generous with the tequila here. I've tried a few different flavors (frozen and on the rocks) and they've all been tasty. I stay in the bar area so I can't recall what the rest of the restaurant looks like, but the service in the bar area has always been great. Only things I can remember trying here are the chicken flautas and one of their quesos (sorry can't remember which one). And both were pretty good."
2,"I don't think I've ever been here during daylight. Or even before 10pm. I'm thankful they are open 24 hours, as very few places close to home are (I think McDonald's is - on weekends). Greasy, completely bad for you, huge portion, cheap, but always tasty Mexican food. Decent end to curb any late night cravings on the way home from a night out!"
4,"Being out here from Denver for a bit i Decided to check out the Vegas Chapter. Well first the doors were locked :( I walk around and run into Larry. Hes in the back pulling weeds. AWESOME. We introduce ourselves and he opens the doors for me. I tell him im from the Denver chapter and he welcomes me with open arms. Immediately i felt like ive been attending this one forever. Its been open about a Year and a half. It was built with the environment in mind and is very green. The Bookstore was closed but i peered in and although this one is smaller it still has a lot of space. They used it well. \n\nThey have a office for your use, and a Main Room to chant, and a over flow room. Then 2 other rooms that double as conference rooms and have smaller gohonzon's in them as well. We talked for a while and gave me some names of the people whos district ill be in. And he wondered back outside to finish landscaping while i chanted for a bit. I said my Goodbyes and went about my way until Sunday. \n\nI even found out the history about how this Buddhist center was built and will be the basis for new SGI centers."
4,I love this spa!! Their customer service is amazing. I've never been to a spa before so they didn't make me feel stupid for not knowing anything about it and they made an extra effort to help me get my appointment when I needed. (I got a couples massage for my fianc\u00e9 on his birthday). They even sent me a thank you card in the mail! \n\nThe massage was so relaxing we were so happy with the results. The prices are also the most affordable I could find in my area. I will definitely go back and recommend this to my friends!!
3,"I called ahead to make sure they had what I was looking for and even early in the morning, the clerk was incredibly nice...\n\nWhen I came in, she pointed me directly to the audio headphones I needed and made sure I had a quick transaction... \n\nOverall, I've been here quite a few times, but the customer service I received on this visit made me a lot more likely to skip the Wal-Mart madness and head to CVS when I need another random item during a work day..."
4,"Wow, what a cool museum!  I went on their free day, which falls on the 1st Sunday of every month but it's absolutely worth full admission price.  My first impression was so cute too because they were letting all the lil kids have fun with sidewalk chalk art.  Then, once I stepped inside the building, I was super excited... they have some pretty impressive dinosaur skeletons!  Walking on, each room was filled with wonder.  It is a must-do if you have kids, and a should-do even if you don't!   :)\n\nSee ya there!"
3,"Came here with my mother in law and sister in law and had a nice time. The service was great. Our server was really funny, cheerful, and helpful. He suggested all kinds of things for us to try, so we went ahead with it. Portions can be somewhat small here, and the price isn't cheap, but we were satisfied. The sushi rice could have been softer and stickier in my opinion, but that's my only gripe ;)"
1,I am too hot for you and you and you!\n\nWhat  kind of car do you drive?\n\nBuy me a drink!\n\nDo you have a table?\n\nNo.\n\nGet out of my face.
1,"I didn't do my research before coming here, and decided to order my standard taro smoothie with boba. \n\nSadly, there were chunks of taro powder on the bottom and I had to throw out half the drink because it was disgusting. \nThe boba had the right consistency though, so I probably should've chosen just a regular tea with boba. \nAfter reading all the reviews, I'll only come back for the shaved snow and not any of the drinks\n\nEdit: The Street, on the other hand, delivered a flawless taro smoothie with boba"
3,"Delightful interior with Mardi Gras/Bourbon Street murals and a giant jester statue inside.  Bar area merges into the restaurant area.  Upstairs seating overlooks downstairs like a outdoor balcony looking down on a street cafe.  Mojitos, chicken and sausage Jambalaya, and sweet potato fries are good, as are the po'boys.  The food is not that spicy; more on the bland side when one thinks of Cajun."
1,"We were rushed from the time we sat down, their goal was to get us out as quick as possible, for the price we were not happy with RM Seafood. Continued upsell became uncomfortable.\n\nFor the price of RM Seafood I would find another place, especially in Vegas. \n\nThe nosie level and the close seating is not a place to have a conversation with you dinner partner."
2,Just above bar food but fine in a pinch.
0,"Is it possible to give no stars?  If so that is what I would give red velvet.  You would think after the cookie brigade they would be gracious for any customers that came in but no.  We ordered a vegan pizza and vegan nachos.  The waiter took our order with an attitude of 'do you know wht you want or not?'  Shocked I placed the order and we waited 25 minutes for the food.  The waiter came over and said the food would be right out.  Still waiting he came back 5 minutes later and said the nachos were made with regular cheese and it would be 10 more minutes!  I was furious.  I asked about the pizza and he said that was ready and brought it out.  It looked disgusting with the piles of daiya cheese not melted.  I asked for the manager.  5 minutes later she came over and tossed the nachos down on the table.  I told her how disgusted I was and she said,  'well the food is correct now.  Do you want it or not?'  I showed her the pizza and she said daiya does not melt.  I corrected her as we use it daily and she again with a horrible attitude asked if I wanted the nachos.  My husband and I looked at each other and we left.  I used to go here all the time but the attitude is the worst I have ever experienced."
2,"Free toppings on tuesday and the specials continue for each day of the week.\nI think I am going to keep this place for the kids.  Neon colored frozen yogurt was totally up their alley. While I give them kuddos for keeping little people happy, I would rather have something without all the coloring."
3,"we stumbled on this place after driving around cave creek for about half an hour.  \n\ndid not know it was affiliated with the more upscale binkleys up the road.  the cafe version of binkleys represents itself very well.\n\nfrom the moment we stepped in, we were happy with the choice.  we sat on the patio and watched a desert sunset.  coyotes crossing the road nearby all while we had a very nice gazpacho and pulled mozzarella for appetizers.  both were very good.\n\nwe also had the fries which were recommended as a \""don't miss\"".  glad we didn't.  the truffle ketchup was very nice too. \n\nhad the bolognese with pollenta and the tri tip.  the tri tip was a bit chewy for our taste and when we advised our waiter, he surprisingly took it off our bill.\n\nthe service at cafe bink was very attentive and friendly.  \n\nthe patio, the food and the view really combine to make this one of the better places we ate while visiting the scottsdale area this past week."
3,"Going to Picasso's was a real experience. When we walked in...we just walked in. No hostes what so ever. Everyone's been to a sports bar before, this was a little strange to me. None the less we found seats close to the big screen. It seems like there's thousands of tv's in this place! I think there were only two servers working that day. But they had it all under control. It's kind of a do as you please atmosphere. Everyone had on a jersey representing their team, it was live! I ordered the two foods their known for. Pizza. Wings. I had a medium cheese pie and the cajun garlic wing basket (or whatever it's called). The pizza, not really all that great. It was just a step up, maybe two, from frozen pizza. ( Our waitress noted that the dough is made in house dailey). Just didn't hit the spot for me. The wings on the other hand...marvelous! I don't know if I'd say the best in Charlotte, but they were pretty good! Sadly when I got to the bottom of my wing baskey ( because I ate all of them), my very last wing had a rather large feather still attached. This rendered it inedible in my book. Overall great spot. I'll be going back for sure."
4,"Went here during Arizona Restaurant Week with my Dad.  What a find!  I'd describe the place as a laid back steakhouse with alot of the usual surf n turf fare.  The waiter was very attentive and responsive to any questions we had.  We had four choices for each course.  For the appetizer he got the Clam Chowder while I got the chopped salad.  Salad was alot bigger than I had imagined, but good.  My Dad was enamored with the chowder.  For the appetizer, I got the 12 oz short rib while my Dad got the 8 oz bacon wrapped filet.  We split each dish.  The filet was cooked to a nice medium rare and bacon added terrific flavor.  The short rib was fall off the bone tender and flavorful.  For the dessert, he got the small chocolate fondue bowl while I got the Ghirardeli chocolate brownie.  Both were outstanding as the fondue chocolate was rich and velvety while the brownie was filled with the right balance of chocolate and caramel and topped with chocolate ice cream.  Each dish had elegant presentation and we didn't have to wait long for each at all.  \n\nIt goes without saying that its hard to find alot of Scottsdale-worthy fine dining experiences on the west side of town.  Other than Flemings and Melting Pot, you won't find another fine dining experience in the West Valley than this place.  Both my Dad and I were very pleasantly surprised by the character and the quality of this place.  I especially recommend this place if you're looking for a spot to try out during Arizona Restaurant Week"
1,"Went for dinner and didn't stick around for the club scene.  The food was nothing special and very over priced.  You go to Vegas and expect to be charged higher than most places, but you also expect a higher quality product.  This place did not deliver.\n\nI will say the setup and atmosphere were pleasant, but that's where the compliments stop!"
0,"I was looking for something healthy to take home and eat. I didn't feel like making anything for me and my 10 year old. Nice girl who waited on us, however I didn't realize she was up selling my 10 year old. I ordered a salad with chicken and avocado mixed baby greens, maybe two raspberries. So, they were generous with lettuce, and nothing else. There was hardly any chicken on my $13.00 salad. Goat cheese? Where? Oh there is a piece of that. So, moving forward, my son ordered pancakes. First of all he's 10 and looks it. She also sold him fries without asking me. He didn't\n even finish his $12.00 pancakes. I left and called back to ask how my bill was 35 bucks for pancakes and a salad. No less she shouldn't have sold him adult menu, or she should of asked. Now I'm stuck with 10 dollars on 2.00 pancakes! \nI will never go back the food was descent, at best. Prices, ridiculous."
2,"I went here with my friends and I was hoping for very good teppan. While the food was good. Especially the garlic chips it was still very overpriced. I feel like the prices damped the experience. It cost 30 dollars for sharing a plate and it did not come with fried rice, ordered separate. Fried rice is a staple with teppan. For 8 oz organic chicken breast cost 45. The miso was good and the dessert was ok. I really want to like it but I just can't. Ceasers has teppan as well. Almost same menu but cost about 20% less."
0,"AVOID! A complete rip off AND terrible service! This place is supposed to be a Michelin star restaurant?? Ha! What a joke. I wouldn't insult Nobu by comparing this place to them. \n\nJust because they have a fancy looking joint inside a beautiful casino means they think they can get away with murder. The food is so bland and so uninspired and SOOO expensive. Listen, I have no problem paying more for quality food but seriously?! Examples...\n\n$22 for a standard boring salmon / avocado sushi roll you would pay $6 for in an average sushi joint. \n$28 for \""BBQ Lamb\"" which was small bowl of greasy and fried onions! The lamb wasn't even nice! It was mixed up and greasy like you'd get from a kebab truck!!!  EXTORTION!! \n\nTo add insult to injury the service was soooo slow and sooooo impersonal and sooooo bad!!! The waiter couldn't describe ANY of the items of the menu, so suggestions, no effort whatsoever. Even more frustrating, they made us wait for half an hour for a table of two. When we finally get in it turns out the place was virtually empty!!!!! They had waiting staff just stood around talking?!?! Is this wait supposed to make us feel like we're not worthy enough for this piece of shit joint?? Are we supposed to believe that this place is super hard to get in to??? \n\nDid I say AVOID this place???????"
1,"Goodness! I tried this place again, got a bagel and Latte. I finished my Latte and asked for a HALF cup refill. $2!! It costs 5 cents to make a cup of coffee. And NO ART ON THE WALLS. Blank! They don't want to support local artists, but think they are owed the support of the locals. Bull crap. That \""buy local\"" notion is for the birds. I buy quality first, and that includes service. Buy local ONLY If it's worthy."
1,Wasn't the worst place I've been too but it still has it's negative points.  Took a little bit for someone to recognize we were even there and than the waitress was slow.  The waitress than left and went home with out letting us know so that just seems weird to me.  35$ for two meals and two beers seems pretty steep.  Oh and the bathroom were mote than unpleasant with the graffiti and the paint falling apart.\n\nThe food was pretty good but not for the price I paid. All in all I'll just say cleanliness goes a long way.
1,"I'm not sure what's going on with you, Picnic Company, but I popped in to visit you today for lunch with Colleen and Amanda... I wanted to show you off to my out-of-town friends.  But unfortunately, you let me down!\n\nYou had no fruit salad and you were out of ham.  Not only that, but I noticed your menu said no yogurt either... and the topper?  No bottled water - ok, I can deal with that.  But if you're out of bottled water and I request a large cup for water, do not charge me 50 cents for the cup.  Really?\n\nI hope I just hit you up on a bad day... I miss the Picnic Company I know and love!"
0,Always have great things to say BUT. If you're going to close at 7:45 then thats what should be posted on your sign not 8:00.  Its a burrito. It'll take about 4 minutes to cook
1,"To the owner Johnny, \n\nYou know, I order from here often multiple times a week, as do at least 10-15 other of my co-workers. I love their food, however the customer service has gotten so horrible, I'm considering no longer ordering from here. I always order 1 of 2 things ususally. However, 75% of the time they forget the dressing for my salad, to the point that now the very nice driver checks first knowing where it is being delivered. Then today, I order a salald, no onions, add olives, like I do 1 a week. My salad came with onions piled on it, and no olives. I call a couple hours later when I realize it, while on my lunch, since we placed a group order earlier today. While the lady who answered the phone offered to send me a new salad (I can't eat onions, nor do I want a salad that's going to taste completely like onions now), and gets my info. 15 minutes later I get a call from who I can only assume to be the chef to complain about why I'm ordereing a new salad when all that was missing was olives. He was extremely disrespectful, and insinuated I was lying due to the time lapse (I have the salad still sitting right here waiting for them to come). After explaining multiple times that I ordered a salad with no onions and got onion, he finally reluctantly agreed to make me a new salad which should be here in another 30 minutes or so. \n\nI am just horrified at this customer service. Considering that my office places proably at least 20-30 orders a week alone, and have been customers there since July on a consistant level, they really need to step it up a notch!!!!!!! Or at least, back up to the notch it was at before."
0,"Terrible shop! What a complete waste of time!\n\nI got a flyer in the mail about their new Flamingo location, and as I was needing an oil change I figured I'd check them out. Mistake! I was the only car anywhere in \""line\"" yet it took almost 5 minutes before one of the three \""mechanics\"" put out his cigarette and came over to my car (all three guys were less than 20 feet away, eating and smoking and looking at me the entire wait). When he did finally saunter over, I told him I had the flyer for a $9.95 Oil Change (to celebrate their Grand Opening). He told me to pop my hood and then proceeded to tell me my car takes \""special oil\"" and it would cost $29.99 to get an oil change. \n\nI've been getting oil changes on this vehicle for 80k miles now, so I'm pretty sure if it needed \""special oil\"" I would have figured that out by now! These people were inconsiderate liars. Save your money and go someplace else!"
0,Another John Taffer bar that closed.
3,Good. Lots of info. Area 51 kinda hokey but still pretty nice way to spend a few hrs.
3,"NIce casino. Well thought out and designed.  Went there last night to hear some live music, wasnt too bad. They have a free self-serve fountain drink stand. Will have to come back for some of the restaurants and give them a go. The cocktail waitresses were smoking hot AND polite!  A nice change from what Vegas has become.   The centerpiece of this casino looks like the pool. They have a great stage set up for live concerts and if you want there are 2-3 balconies and other areas that you can be at to watch the show without having to be in the pool. \nWill definitely be returning in the daylight to check it out and give the restaurants a spin.   Be aware, this is way south of the strip and a bit of a slog. Will likely only go there for concerts. Mostly will be populated by californians who dont want to go all the way up to the zoo to play......"
0,"Meh. I used to come to Vegas almost twice a month since I was a child and even lived here for a short period of time and I always remembered this cafe coming through the doors of the MGM. \n\nTo be honest, I never had the chance to check it out and the only reason I did was because almost every place was too packed to get seating to eat. I opted for the bar and got a pasta dish.  Before I even ordered, it was a little alarming that the chef had to come out to explain to a customer why the dish he served was off. Knowing I was short on time, I opted for a pesto pasta and chicken dish.\n\nNormally, I am a huge fan of pesto & pasta but the mediocrity of the $20 pasta plate I got was a really mood killer. I could honestly have made a better dish with $3 and the amount of time (~25 minutes) it took for them to serve my dish. Not worth the wait, and not worth the $."
2,"Was lucky enough to attend a screening of a locally made film here.\nIt's one of those arty type places that if you're welcomed in, you feel part of the team. That you might come back again and again. I felt an urge to sign up for a photography course just so I could visit again. Or you might walk in here whilst on a wander, not quite knowing what exactly you've just stepped into, and walk straight back out again, nonethewiser. \nThere were no exhibitions on show during our visit, but I've heard they can be exceptional. But on the same note, I'm sure there is a fair amount of self-loving-I'm-capturing-my-inner-self type indulgence to be found.\nIf you're keen on photography, then do go and see what's on offer."
0,"This place is dirty, dreary, depressing and filled with smoke. The dentist music they play really LOUD is icing on the cake. Yuck!"
1,"After a day of shopping at Chandler Fashion we decided to stop in, watch the Cardinals game and relax with good food and exceptional beer. Just prior to arriving at BJ's our 7 y.o. daughter wanted some pretzel bites from Wetzels and we also decided to get some pigs in a blank for my mother-in-law. We walked into the restaurant where the manager very rudely and loud enough for other patrons to hear tell us we could not bring food from other \""restaurants\"" into \""her\"" restaurant. Her overreaction was completely unnecessary and very embarrassing to my family and me. Undeterred, we did stay even though we were forced to sit outside, not our first choice of seating arrangements. The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our \""contraband\"" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers. On an up note the food and libations were excellent; the service was fantastic and I can only hope that the manager gets a scholarship to charm school prior to our next visit."
1,"Had an awful crab cake here with little crab in it but mostly lots of breading and filler.. Even the Phillips brand ones at Costco are better than most. And of course Eleven has the best ever. But anyways, hubby got a deep fried cod filet that was sandwiched between 2 hamburger buns, which was pretty decent fried fish while it was hot and crispy... But my crab cake was sadly unforgivable."
4,"Joy did make-up for my wedding and everyone looked fabulous! I don't usually wear make-up, so it was important for me to look like myself. Joy did a great job of highlighting my best features without taking away from my natural beauty. In addition my make-up didn't smear or streak despite the rain and my tears! Thank you Joy, I appreciate it!"
0,"f this place! \n\nmy boyfriend and i walked in, looked at the menu and walked out.\n\nthey charge 3 dollars for a bowl of rice. wtf?\nthis place is more like korean bbq, not japanese. false advertisement!\n\nand the portions would have been really small, had i ordered them.....\ndont want to pay $40 for a snack for one person. sorry! dont like leaving places hungry.\n\nso thats why we left...\n\ni hope they close. prime retail space can be used for something else. rip off prices. get them out now.\n\ni guess they tried to differ themselves from all the other korean bbq places in lv. fakers.\n\nim mean, but i think its bad business. i really do."
0,I really like Arby's but I can't recommend this location.  Took the family for lunch this week and when we walked in we immediately lost our appetite.  The smell was so overpower of 'airport latrine' that we lost our appetites.  We moved from the front area to see if it was any better in the dining room and then we were confronted with crazy bad carpet smell.  I guess stick to the drive thru if you want to still have an appetite for Arby's at this location.
0,"Manager is a complete jerk. Customer service means nothing. I came in for dinner and drinks while restaurant  area was almost empty. I was told I could not sit at a booth because there were only two of us and we would need at least four. His reasoning was \""it might get busy\"". Instead we were seated at a small table where the game we were there for was almost impossible to see.  Pretty much every request was answered with NO for the entire meal by the waitress.  I had multiple experiences like this and finally had enough. I would go to the Tilted Kilt  or Arena just a few blocks away"
3,"Dragonfly is a great neighborhood restaurant in Scottsdale Ranch. The food is unique and the atmosphere is fun and slightly funky.  There is a nice selection of outdoor seating and on the night we were there, a live musician was entertaining the diners.\n\nThe food is exceptional, uses many local ingredients, is atypical and yet still satisfying.  As I am about to move out of the neighborhood, I am sad to no longer be in walking-distance of this great spot."
2,"The ambiance is what brings people in & it's also probably what keeps them coming back.... that & the strong drinks, lol. \n\nThere's a large patio, but for me it wasn't a big lure because it was hot outside. It was only 90, so maybe when it gets to 100 they have misters? Who knows :)\n\nMy sister had a margarita & from where I sat, across the table, it was burning my nose, lol!\n\nFor an appetizer we had the guacamole. It could have used a squeeze of lime, but other than that it was good! Fresh.  For my main dish I opted for the blackened mahi tacos, which had a 2 chili rating, the highest on the menu. I was expecting hot, but it was barely mild. The ahi itself was good. On the menu it said it came with pineapple pico de gallo & tomatillo salsa. I got neither. I asked for the pineapple pico de gallo. It was so disappointing! Bland & not fresh. I don't think these 2 corn tortilla tacos were worth $15. I chose not to have the beans and rice the tacos come with, but if you want to get full you'd probably need to keep those :) \n\nMy sister got the California burrito and she loved it. Maybe I'll give that a try next time!"
2,"Located in the Rivers Casino with a view of the patio and river. I can tell that outside seating in the summer is tops here. This was a good stop for food before gaming. \n\nThe staff was friendly to us but painfully slow to get hamburgers, salad and chicken fingers order out to us! Though, I bet that was fine, so you do not spend all your cash in the casino while your eating at least. ;) \n\nDrinks are overpriced and food was very average. Burgers were ok but the fires were dried out and unappealing.\n\nThe chop salad with grilled chix, however, was the best meal on the table. I'd given 2 stars if my mother was not raving how much she enjoyed said salad.\n\nI'd say worth a try esp if you can hit the happy hours here and are into watching sports, they have a million tv's in here. ;)."
0,"I clearly have a different opinion of this place compared to other reviews. this was my second visit here. the first being a few years ago. \nI do not even know where to begin. \nThe place is wall to wall people. So crammed on top of one another. It is so loud you cannot hear what the other people at your table are saying. The tables are not big enough for the amount of people they seat at them. We were 6 people squished in a table which was meant for 4.\nOur server may have been new so I will try to cut him some slack. but he did get alot of our order wrong. Our drinks were mixed up, it took forever to get our appetizers, the entrees came pretty quickly. but one was wrong. The dessert was the worst part. My sister brought in a cake for my nephews birthday, and it took nearly an hour before it arrived. By this point we asked that it be put back in the box to take home. \nThe food was not good. There are so many better options for Italian food. Real Italian food. To me this is on the same level of Olive Garden. The one shining star of the meal was the spinach and artichoke dip. it was one of the best I have ever had. \nSave your money go elsewhere, where you can have a great meal and a nice conversation. \nI for one will never go back."
2,"I went in for an Invisalign consultation, everyone was wonderful and friendly, location was handy for me and it was set out spaciously. This was my 1st Invisalign consult I'd had so I didn't know much about cost yet. They quoted me almost $7000 total for the full treatment - I was told I would have to put $1800 down first for the company to make the first set of trays, wow! I sensibly took the decision to shop around a bit before comitting (even though I was offered a $500 discount if I signed the paper right there on the day) I have since visited 3 other orthodontists and None have been so expensive as here also none have required such a high down payment for the initial trays to be made. I have found a place who are doing the whole treatment for less than 2/3 of the price I was quoted here. \nI am writing this so that others in my position are aware and to perhaps question the cost & shop around. \nexpensive expensive expensive!"
3,"Sapporo around Happy Hour is some of the BEST people watching in town.  Want to see cougars on the prowl, park yourself somewhere near the bar.  Ask for the little booth just up the stairs, though, so you are out of hunting range.  It's amazing.\n\nAnd the sushi is great to boot.  I was previously much happier with it until the happy hour menu became slightly more expensive.  Thus the 4 instead of 5 stars.  A few months ago, I would go twice a week for happy hour... make sure the hostess gives you the menu.\n\nBe prepared to eat a lot quickly.  These sushi chefs crank out the raw fish like a factory.  Stagger your order if you want, or just be ready to inhale.  It's creative and great!  \n\nToo bad about the prices.  No longer can you go, gorge, drink, and walk away $25 the poorer.  Now you're looking at $40 or so, almost full price.  ah well, it's worth it twice a month now, if only for the people watching."
2,"Legume is one of the nicest restaurants in Oakland, but it's obvious they're aware of that fact when setting the prices.  The food is good, but not so amazing that one couldn't find a better meal for less money in another neighborhood.  That said, the rotating menu makes it a little hard to rate, as unsuccessful dishes can be quickly swapped out for other options.  This place has potential to be a great restaurant, but it has a bit of a learning curve to get through first."
2,"A hispanic woman with a minimal command of the English language was running the place when I stopped in, and I thought to myself how strange for a latina to be running an Italian Market. Then I noticed the tip jar. At a sandwich shop. I get so tired of seeing that. I'd have rated this place 5 stars if not for that. This place specializes in Boar's Head meats, and making sandwiches a'la Quiznos with them, but you must ASK for the Boar's Head meat otherwise you get some generic meat. Heck I'd have rated this place 1 star, but it takes guts to open a restaurant in this neighborhood in these tough economic times. The sandwich was, well, no different than I can make at home for around eight bucks. They also had large deli pickles for a buck, potato salad for four bucks a pound, etc. You get the idea. There are tables to eat your lunch if you decide to stick around.\n\nAbout the only thing that I notice makes this place an Italian Market is the olive oil prominantly featured in front of the store.  Well, ok. They laughed at Jobs and Wozniak when they named their computer after a fruit.\n\nI honestly hope this business succeeds. This neighborhood could use a successful sandwich shop.  Oh wait. There's that Quiznos around the corner at Rancho and Charleston, and is that Jimmy Johns still in business at Decatur and Sahara? Charleston and Decatur has a Quiznos, right?  And then there's that sandwich shop in that business park next to that bank....\n\nAnyway, I really hope this one stays in business.\n\nP.S. Scott, yer slakkin! How did I beat you to this review?"
3,I love the Y here with the gym on the Treadmills there is a great View of the Sheep Mountains. \nThe gym is also baby friendly with a great Daycare Staff!\nNot to mention all the extra fitness events and classes that they offer.\nMy only complaint is one for my own- I like workin out at night and they close and open at all different times.. So scheduling around there schedules is a bit stressing- other than that its a great rate and a great workout!!
1,"When in Vegas, you have this desire to check out \""famous\"" places.\n\nI was a little underwhelmed by this place. It was very dark and the decor very outdated.\n\nI did not like looking at menus on the wall, nor did I like having my meal as a package deal. I don't drink wine. I can't eat 10 pounds of food.\n\nIf you like wine and can eat a lot, this is a pretty fairly priced option.\n\nIn any case, I had the minestrone with my meal which was pretty ordinary. Tasted a bit like it came out of a can. For my entree, I had the veal parm. Again, it was pretty ordinary. The veal wasn't particularly tender. The \""cappuccino\"" at the end of the meal wasn't cappuccino. It really tasted like some sugary powdered coffee-like drink.\n\nOur waitress was unattentive and slow. Took forever to get anything.\n\nAll in all, I would skip this place. There are so many better options."
1,"Had high hopes for this place, but I was pretty disappointed.  My friend has some Platinum Rewards card so we only had to wait a few minutes even though there was quite a long line to get in.  Score!\n\nWe started off with the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Yum - you could definitely taste the truffle.  each got a burger of course.  I wish the fries had been more crisp however.  They also came with two yummy dipping sauces.  $10 for fries is way too much, though.  We all ordered a burger, of course:  Farm Burger (came w/ a fried egg), Euro Burger, and American Burger.  My burger was seriously burnt on the outside even though I ordered their recommendation, Medium Rare.  Ugh.  I would have returned it, but I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for my burger.  My friend had them put the goat cheese for her Euro Burger on the side, but then made the mistake of smearing too much on it before she discovered she hated goat cheese.  :P  \n\nA trendy restaurant that doesn't deliver.  Not sure why the line is so long - I am assuming these are people who have never eaten there?  I liked Bachi Burger in Vegas much more and it was more affordable.  Burgr charges about $15 per burger and the patty isn't that large (and mine was burnt - did I mention that??)."
1,"The worse burgers I have ever had. I ordered a hamburger with everything on it except I asked for no onions because I am allergic to them. They brought it with the onions. Then I waited for 10 minutes for the waitress to come to my table...but she never did. Finally asked another waitress to help. She took the 1st order back and brought me another one without the onions. No flavor what so ever. Well, the original waitress never came back. I did not take another bite of the hamburger. They never apologized and they still charged my husband and I an arm and a leg. Waitress are very rude. Will never eat there again, thats for sure. I rather eat a burger at in and out or burger king....much better flavor and less expensive."
4,They're not kidding when they say they have the best chowder in Arizona.
1,"Definitely Meh - I've had better. \n\nOverall a good generic pub - good live music, good pub food, bad and inflexible waitress/computer system.\n\nWhile we were there there was a live band that played class rock style music. they were good for a bar band. The nachos we shared were really good stand up bar food. My friend said hs wings were good, not great. The most annoying thing was that the kitchen closed at 10pm and they didn't warn us it was closing. We had ordered the nachos but were still hungary so we were going to split more with the group but couldn't order any more (I think it was like 10:08pm, so annoying. Also we oder some shots and pints which were fine but we wanted to order polar bear shots. They're usually half creme de menthe (mint liquor) and half creme de cacao (chocolate liquor). Super yummy and tastes like a york peppermint patty. They didn't have them on their shots list but we just told the waitress what it was but she couldn't make it for us because there wasn't a code for it in their computer system and they couldn't dispense shots without the computer system because it tracked the liquor use.  So annoying. We asked can't you just charge us for 2 shots of creme de cacao and 2 shots of creme de menthe but put them together in a shaker and then pour it out into 4 shot glasses? But the waitress wouldn't. Not the best service. \n\nLater (I think midnight) the downstairs lounge/bar area turns into a bit of a club with pounding dance music but it wasn't that great. There wasn't enough dance space/room and the music was pretty crappy. \n\nBasically it wasn't the worst ever but it certainly wasn't anything above or beyond. I wouldn't rush to go back again anytime soon but I woulnd't refuse to return."
1,"Lots of tables with friendly service but it's weird to be asked if I've had sushi before or if I know it's bad luck to pour my own saki.\n\nThey have Kirin on tap and a selection of saki but there doesn't appear to be a happy hour.  They have unfiltered saki in various price ranges which I really like so I ordered one unfiltered and one filtered - I got two unfiltered and I wasn't really able to say much before the cap was popped.  Fortunately I like saki.  \n\nThey have the standard rolls - caterpillar without the tentacles saddens me - but the menu is a touch too casual for me.   I like Mexican food as much as the next guy, but sushi with Doritos or salsa?  I tried them but they were a miss for me.\n\nThis location has been a tough sell and I'm not sure Nori will make it."
4,Possibly the only vegetarian place I will eat regularly. I initially wanted to work through the entire menu but started craving items I enjoyed I started going back to them. Lunch specials are super filling for the price. Plates and stuff are cheap but whatever the food makes up for it. Oh yes and the chutney bar is awesome! And the pickled hot stuff whatever it is is so bomb. I could eat a bowl of just that!
4,"as far as frozen yogurt goes, this place is the best quality i have found.  it is a little more pricey then most of the places around, but the yogurt and the fruit toppings just seem to be of such better quality."
3,"I am so happy I found a place like this on the east side. It kinda reminds me of LGO but more accessible and spacious, I have found parking close by every time. I'm a sucker for downtown areas and rebuilt old buildings that are also well designed (the bathrooms are a must-see) and I love all the natural lighting from the big windows. It's been a little too chilly to sit on the patio, but it's tucked away from the road a bit, so I bet you'll find me there come springtime. \n\nI keep coming back for the latte bowl. It's fantastic and stays hot for like an hour. We had a pizza last week which was really good, but yesterday ordered the breakfast quesadilla and although it was humongous (enough for two), it was kinda greasy on the inside. Everything else I have had has been really good though. \n\nI am totally looking forward to the Espresso 101 and 102 classes I keep hearing about. I also want to try their other restaurant \""Joes BBQ\"" across the street. I've heard good things about that place too."
3,"Sagt mir mal eine Stra\u00dfe weltweit, an deren einen Ende eine Burg und am anderen Ende ein Palast steht? Na? Richtig, die Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Oben thront Edinburgh Castle auf dem Castle Hill, in knapp 2km Entfernung liegt im Canongate der Palace of Holyrood House.\n\nEntlang dieser Stra\u00dfe, die nat\u00fcrlich sehr touristisch ist, liegen viele der Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten Edinburghs wie St. Giles Church, die Highland Tolbooth Church, verschiedene Museen, das schottische Parlament und nat\u00fcrlich auch Andenkengesch\u00e4fte, Pubs, Restaurants, Caf\u00e9s.\n\nMan ist auf dieser Stra\u00dfe nie alleine, ganze Busladungen ergie\u00dfen sich \u00fcber die Royal Mile.\n\nBesonders sehenswert sind auch die kleinen Gassen links und rechts der Royal Mile, die sogenannten \""Close\"".

3,"Great old-school local dive bar... (think 1970) Drinks are very reasonable, and the crowd can be varied (slow, busy, young, old). One pool table and a jukebox are about it for entertainment. Happy hour and after 11pm are the best time to visit. Smoking is allowed just outside the back door (but your drinks are not).\n\nLocated at the SE corner of Granite Reef and McDonald next to Bashas in Central Scottsdale.\n\nCash only! (they have an ATM)"
4,"\""Kids\"" treated us all the dinner at Nobus.....I can't even list everything we had...but I think they ordered a really nice and pricey Omakase...at first I was a little worried that we were gonna leave hungry, but the dishes kept coming and coming and coming....my favorites were the scallops and black cod wrapped in a shredded potato and fried, the wagyu beef and lobsters and the deep fried shrimp head as well as the soft shell crab...the mirugai sushi was also really good....\nIt's the kind of place where you're really glad you got to go, but I know I couldn't afford to be a regular there.....just to glad to have had the experience.\nService was good and the restaurant decor was again, impressive!"
0,There was a 40 minute line for a car... And so many people waiting. I would anywhere rather than wait that long... Not recommended
0,Frequently get take out from this place. Food usually fairly decent. Except we found some type of flying bug in the bottom of our rice container. Called to complain and they offered 20% off our next bill and did not sound surprised by our find. Considering the money we have spent there over the years I was highly upset. But they seemed to care less. Guess I have to drive to sesame next time.
2,"3.5 stars for brunch. We had reservations at 11:30am on Sunday for 5 but Lidia's was not overly crowded. Wide open space with tall ceilings. Servers were friendly and did not push us out after we paid our bill, which was nice.\n\nBring your appetite!! Highlights:\nThe OJ in the Mimosa was fresh\nThe rosemary and sea salt bread with sugar butter\nLemon scone with sugar butter, and apricot and strawberry  butter\nFried cauliflower from the antipasto table\nMy main entree - grilled octopus w/ potatoes, onions, string beans, olives, pickled onions - salty which I loved and the octopus was tender and cooked well\nThe pistachio and ginger mini cookies were my favorite\nCoffee brewed well\n\nThe other items were just okay so while there were some standouts Lidia's brunch was more quantity verse quality given the wide spread available.\n\nYou will not leave hungry and if you do you did Lidia's wrong!\n\nAlso they will break out checks separately."
3,"Went in for record store day. Lots of people, lots of merchandise to look at. Big store! Would highly recommend for anyone interested in records/music in general. Fair prices too, some cheaper than walmart! Lost a star for smell of the place."
2,"So So disappointed!  The only two things that impressed me were the flower petal girls--well, only the Scarlet Johannson looking oen at the entrance (HOT)--and the upstairs women's bathroom (you get your own room with a sink!).   \n\nI only chose Tao because of the VIP wristbands which gives you VIP entrance and all access to Lavo, Tao, and Tao Beach. Plus, they play hip hop. I figured that as long as we didn't have to wait in line, paying $150+ for these wristbands would be worth it. \n\nWe still had to wait in line, which was about 30+ minutes. Not too bad, I guess. However, I missed the open bar that came with my wristband because I kept going to the wrong bar area and by the time I got to the right one, it was over. Real convenient, guys.   \n\nDespite my abhorrence to house/EDM, I prefer XS. Their setup and decor is so much better."
0,The worst Thai Bbq I've had. There food is just so different from California Thai Bbq. Being different is fine but there food is like weird different. S2 bbq was so sweet thatvit didn't taste like thai. There portion was so small. The fried rice taste like blant. Sweet and sour chicken was super sweet. Everything we ate was like bad. 1 star was for their staff they were nice & friendly. Will never go back here.
3,Good place to come in the morning. Good Donuts and they will always make fresh coffee as needed.
2,Good hangover food at the Manday Bay Resort.  The duck and noodle soup ain't bad.  Kimchi was average at best.
0,"My first visit to Cadillac Ranch Las Vegas location was very disturbing. It revealed a culture of disrespect highlighted by inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. This culture of disrespect seemed to be fully reinforced by management who did not care to listen or address our immediate complaints.  Certainly such behaviors have a negative effect on Cadillac Ranch's profits and reputation, so I thought it worthwhile to address corporate management.\n\nEvidently, our bartender, Rachel (Bar3-t8), was not happy with the 10% tip we provided.  We were $1.50 short of 20% but we were not happy with her poor service.  She was belligerent loudly calling us \""Cheap ass mofos\"",  instructing security to \""get them out of here, they don't deserve to finish their drinks\"", and proclaiming, \""this is my bar, don't come back.\""  We sat their dumb founded that she would treat customers with such disrespect. We quietly left the bar area to seek the manager.\n\nOur group of four never imagined or has ever experienced such disrespect. After spending $25 as entrance fee, $25 for hookah, and $29.23 at the bar,  a total of $79.23, we wanted to let the manager know we felt we paid too much for  the insults. However, to make matters worse, we were informed by an assistant manager, that the manager \""was busy counting money\"" so we were to take his business card instead. Evidently, while he had time to count our $79.23, he did not have enough time to tend to our concerns.\n\nAs we make our complaints to Yelp, the BBB and the corporate office of Cadillac Ranch we are left wondering what sort of abuse we might have experienced if we left no tip. Are tips required even for unsatisfactory service? \n\nIt also begs the question, \""Is this behavior condoned by corporate management?\""  Or, \""Will we get some meaningful action from corporate?\"" I know from running my own business and having worked at a Fortune 500 company that substantive changes do not happen overnight, nor did the degradation of customer service at Cadillac Ranch. Typically a signal needs to be sent throughout the organization so that even long after this incident, a line item exists showing a problem occurred and other line items are created to initiate a long-term solution. I suggest a refund of our $79.23 is the needed signal that will also give us reason to try your establishment again."
2,"Visited on 12/26/2013. The current online menu is from 11/12/2013. 4 of 20 items were the same.  \n\nMeat plate\nCheese plate\nMeat/Cheese plate\nBurger\n\nRestaurants, an online menu makes sense when it's updated! \n\nOdd door-front curtains. It's a cool entrance but corny from inside.. is it to separate crammed dining room from those waiting? It sticks out, and Bar Marco is more a dim-lit+high chatter+blend-in vibe. Dark with a stifling dash of hipster.\n\nService was slammed, one guy working the 8 tables out front. Our second round of drinks took 25 minutes. He apologized before we could comment when he dropped the check, so they're good enough to realize it. Descriptions were on-point 75%, occasional stuttering and stammering when questioned. \n\nThe bar is novelty. \""We have no cocktail menu\"" she challenged with a smirk. Game on! Drink #1 was awesome, ordered in person. Drink #2 was third-person via waiter, and it came out with 2/5 the ingredients asked for. Conclusion: SIT AT THE 6-PERSON BAR, WHOLE MEAL. That said, neither drink was more standout than a good cocktail from a printed-menu.. anticipate that novelty wearing thin on return trips.\n\nFood is decent at best, mix of tapas and classy bar. Cheese plate is a cheese plate, the earthy honey and jalapeno jelly the highlight. The fried smelt needs more lime and salt, the fish arguably too delicate for frying though the light mayo cuts the oil well. The tartare is well-diced with few clumps but way over-spiced, cumin masking the meal. The bolognese was bland and the sauce watery with chemical hints. Definitely could do with more salt and another minute on the noodles.\n\nIf the bar is one reason I'd return, the pork belly is the other. Everyone does pork belly these days. Bar Marco actually does it right: perfectly crisp edge with the piping hot sticky gob of fat melting in your mouth. No \""sour\"" per the menu, but the definite highlight. Adult candy."
4,Always great food!
3,"After a huge disappointment at a Thai restaurant - our party went to a place called \""True Foods\"". I had been to the one in Scottsdale and liked it and this one in Phoenix proved to be on par with the other.\n\nMy wife and I both had the Tuscan Kale salad with grilled chicken, son had Street Tacos and DIL had Asian Noodles - ALL of the meals were purdy darn good - except my wife's Chicken was a bit dry - mine was nice and juicy, but it came late - a small issue! We also decided to share two deserts among the four of us - a Chi Pudding with Banana and Coconut and a Strawberry and Rhubarb Crisp with Vanilla Ice Cream - ending our trip to True Foods was VERY GOOD!\n\nThe restrooms were clean, the rest of the place was showroom and the food that you are going to receive is right our on display. They validate your parking so you get two hours for free. \n\nCredit cards are accepted and you won't be disappointed. We each tried something different and were very happy with our choices - I'd still like to try their pizzas because they looked incredible on their way to other tables. The place was buzzing - a true sign that you were getting true GOOD food!"
1,"I can't understand why my hubby likes this place so much. I think they're pricey, and their burgers are just alright; the fries are barely crispy. But, the service has always been friendly. I would prefer to stick to In -n-Out or even Carl's Jr. when I'm in the mood for a tasty burger meal."
2,"Pretty good for a chain. They ask you how you want your steak cooked but it does not matter.. it comes out 'well done' no matter what. And it was over marinated, a bit salty... it got sent back. I went with the Salmon which was much better.\n\nThe mango tres leches was much better than I expected."
1,"Our mouths were watering as we scanned the wall menu and ordered our burgers and onion rings. The decorum, lighting, seating and staff were wonderful. The only thing missing was tasty food. Seriously, the burgers were flavor free and laced with enough salt to cure bacon. The onion rings looked fantastic but also lacked crispness and flavor. Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, please visit Las Vegas and school the kitchen staff. We know your recipes rock- we use them at home.  \n\nWhen it comes to restaurants, what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas."
3,"Le Thai is a slightly overpriced Thai restaurant that gets my vote based on their G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S patio outside.  I love that patio because it's covered, shady, and makes you feel like you're in a little oasis in the middle of downtown Vegas.\n\nAs I said, when you're used to going to places like Archie's Thai or Pan Asia, the sticker price here is a little, \""Ahhh!\"" but it is very good Thai food.  My favorite dish is the Three Color Curry which mixes red, yellow, and green.  Have you ever thought, \""Man, I could really go for some red curry right now, but I want potatoes in it like yellow curry.\""  Well, Three Color Curry is the best of all three curry worlds.  The spice levels here are intense, so go low if you're not sure.\n\nI've also had the pad thai and the ga pow (basil stir fry).  All of the food here is full of flavor and they offer the option of brown rice at no extra charge!  Side note, their cocktail menu is quite good, which I didn't expect at a Thai restaurant.  I especially enjoyed the Lady Boy and the one with champagne and St. Germaine (I can't remember the name of that one!).\n\nThe trick is to come for the lunch special, which is even honored on Saturdays!  You get an entree and a drink for only $9.95.  They also have a nice Happy Hour menu with apps and drink specials (again, EVEN ON SATURDAY!)."
2,"Well I really like the improvements they made here. Last visit the menu was just a two sided laminated card. Now the extensive menu is a mini booklet. New drinks. Some new appetizers too.\n\n Still I wasn't impressed with the new signature burger that is being marketed. Pepper & Smoke.  Smoked sea salt, smoke and pepper ketchup black pepper bacon. Ciabatta bread.   Sounds awesome!  Good combo of ingredients! Sadly execution wise the handmade Angus Beef burger was a fail here.  I didn't taste a hint of pepper or smoky flavor at all.  Now that I think back on it could be they gave me the wrong order since it resembled more like a bbq burger with fried onions and bbq sauce.  Either way though, the patty was dry and no flavor.  \n\nI really liked the service though this time around.  The side of  Yukon potato chips and onion dip is pretty good and I like the price points for the sides 3,5 and 7 dollars.  So maybe I'll just keep this place in mind for happy hour."
2,"This really isn't my sort of restaurant, but the family wanted seafood, and there aren't too many options, so we ended up here.  The Seafarer near Albemarle Road (think: the big whale) was closed, and this was all we could think of that wasn't too far away.\n\nFirst, the good...\n\nThe place is huge.  Cavernous, really.  In fact, one of the kids made up a new word to describe it (which I can't remember right now).  Ginormous plus something else, which I guess makes it one made up word with another one.  It's even worse because it was pretty close to empty.  Maybe it gets busier on weekend, but not on a Monday night.\n\nStaff is friendly.  Ish.  Not overly friendly, but nice enough.\n\nPortions are large.  No ifs, ands or buts about it.  I tend to like eating, and I ate plenty, but there were lots of leftovers.  If this was kitchen nightmares, Gordon Ramsey would wonder what they are doing giving away so much food.\n\nThe sweet tea is sweet.  Not quite as syrupy as my granny used to make, but awfully close.  Perhaps the closest I've had in a restaurant.\n\nNow, the bad...\n\nThere really isn't anything, other than the fact that the food is so-so, but that's really to be expected.  I mean it's not like Charlotte is on the water in any way, shape or form, so did you expect fresh seafood?  It's not bad, it just isn't that great.\n\nThe hush puppies are pretty decent, and the food comes out quickly, it's just that it's not fresh, so it can only be so good, you know?"
3,"Best doughnuts in Pittsburgh. \n\nI generally pass on other baked goods. Mediocre bread.\n\nGenerally unfriendly staff, but Walnut St. attracts pretty arrogant customers - so it makes sense."
1,"So I used to work for a major travel company and I had pretty much stayed at every hotel in Las Vegas except for Luxor so I wanted to try it out finally. \n\nI wish i hadn't stayed here and wasted my money. \n\nWe originally booked the pyramid standard non smoking room but when we walked in it smelled like a dirty hole in the wall bar!\n\nAlso the bed comforter had holes in it and the carpets were filthy!! This room looked so nasty and old totally UNACCEPTABLE! So I called down to the front desk to complain after being transferred a million times I got a rude women who hated her job obviously and said there were no more pyramid standard rooms available. If we wanted to switch rooms we would have to upgrade to a tower suite for an additional $50 dollars no comp upgrade! \n\nI said alright whatever I will pay it as is worth it to get out of this nasty diseased looking and smelling room! So we go to the check in desk all the way on the other side in their tower and the front desk lady is a complete b**** OMG! \n\nWow just completely rude and miserable i guess she was pms'ing that day or something. So we finally get checked into the \""Tower Suite\"" SUITE REALLY? YUCKO It was just an over sized dump! Nice sized living room I'll give them that bedroom was very small and the \""spa tub\"" was the size of a regular tub just with jets in it! This room was just as dumpy as the first just bigger. \n\nOverall I was so disappointed with the room and even more disappointed with the service or lack of good customer service! The only thing good about this hotel is there shows Carrot Top is a riot and i heard Fantasy is amazing. \n\nPLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE ...TRUST ME!"
3,"First spot I landed at when arriving in Vegas after checking into the MGM. It was late, and I was famished but didn't want something heavy. I ordered the tuna tartare and it was exactly what I needed. Small, fresh, just enough food to hold me to the next day and allow me to sleep without indigestion. Success! Had a few rounds of drinks with colleagues. Wine was good. Champagne was delicious. \n\nWe ate at Craftsteak the night after and everyone who ordered beef said Wolfgang's steaks were better. \n\nAlso, a lot of restaurants closed early, but this was still going strong. Highly recommend!"
1,"I must say I don't always feel like the service is poor in this or all Home Depots but today was an experience.  I waited in garden for Over 30 minutes for one garden associate to help me the register, but she never came the line was a mile long in the garden department and when the cashier was finally free he told me she was the only one who could help me (I did not expect him to step away, was just hopeful he would call for backup) I then preceded to seek out a flatbed cart that I could use to start helping myself and even that was an exhausting process. Every cart in every aisle had some overstock of plants on it. Outside there were two more carts with excess plants on them as well. I located one cart that had several of the same plant and I stocked the shelf just so I could have a flatbed cart. (There were none inside either) phew!\n\nFinally ready to get what I need and still no one was available to answer my questions. I finally made a purchasing decision and got what I thought I needed and a young girl approached me and asked me if I needed help. I will say better late than never she was pleasant and even helped me load my vehicle I was super impressed by her. I really wish I could remember her name SHE deserves 5 stars.  This was exhausting and unnecessary a 20 minute trip turned into over an hour. Silly. Please get your people some help. I live nearby and want to feel good about shopping with you."
4,LOVE the staff here.. LOVE the little black dresses that ALWAYS fit me.. hard to accomplish in this short petite body with a bit of curve.. I mean.. its a 2 on top and 4 in the middle.. Im a member of the club.. and they always have an incentive at checkout.. sometimes I like .. and sometimes I pass.. depends on my AmX bill that month.. I have a beautiful white trench coat from here.. too long in the arm.. but they offered to send it out for me.. Ill even drive out of my way to go to this particular store..Date dress central.. yay!

3,I wondered around this part of town thinking I was going to have my kilt pulled down and I would be well and truly bug.....fleeced by some tourist trap of a restaurant and then I came across this place. A lovely lovely lovely place to eat traditional Scottish Thai Food. \n\nAll joking aside the food was scrummy (that means good to those of you who do not live in my world or use my lexicon). Scrummy I tell you!!!! The the green prawn curry - yum!!!! the red chicken curry - yummy!!! the pad thai - yummyerer!!!! \n\nI confess I ate here on two occasions within a 24 hour period. It may have had something to do with the number of beers(gin and whisky) I have....I am not fessing up to anything. \n\nThe staff were nice and attentive. The place was clean and I will go again. Save yourself the anguish and do not look too far for somewhere decent to eat.
1,This is one of my family's favorite malls of all time. We will be boycotting this mall due to ruining Halloween for our little girl. They claimed they celebrated it on the 30th and were not giving candy out on HALLOWEEN!! Another store told us they were not allowed to solicit on Sunday. We had to trick or treat in our neighborhood. The working class were giving candy out but corporate America just couldn't do it this year.
0,"These assholes \""replaced my number \"" because they couldn't fix the left clip holding it in . Waited a week for my car only to find the clip had just been fixed and the stole my cell phone charger . No I didn't take it out I never take it out and they still had the balls to charge me for a new bumper"
0,Do not order a mixed drink. When asked if there was alcohol the female bartender said that is how she was told to make them. Plus had to wait 15 min just to get service at the bar. Hi Fi and Diercks are much much better!
3,"Came here based on the recommendation of a few people we met during our stay in Scottsdale. \n\nWe ordered:  \n\nBreakfast Bowl - Think breakfast burrito without the tortilla and with pork green chili on top of your scramble.  \n\nHuevos Rancheros - Breakfast tostada bowl but the tortilla is not crispy.  Topped with green chili sauce. \n\nBiscuits and gravy - very dense. Not too much flavor\n\nMushroom omelette - needed more mushroom.  Creme fraiche is pretty much sour cream. \n\nOverall, food was good.  Some dishes were better than others.  We recommend getting the dishes with the pork chili, since the chili was really tasty.  \n\nService:  Very nice.  \n\nAmbience:  Cute, casual breakfast joint.  Pretty large place with ample seats inside and outside.\n\nParking: Ample rear parking \n\nOverall:  For food, we would give 3.5-4 stars.  Good breakfast joint but short of mind blowing. If you are near by, I'd pop in but I wouldn't go out of my way for this one."
1,"Come on fellow Yelpers, i know you guys know good food and this is just not it. \nThis was my first trip to Cosmo and of course to the Wicked Spoon as well and mainly based off the reviews of this place from here i had to see what all the fuss was about. Upon arrival i was surprised to see no line on a Sunday evening (wut!) and so i was seated in 2 minutes and onto the food. \nWill my server nice dude, friendly smile (no homo), and good personality took my drink order and said get your grub on which i was prepared to do. Did the stroll over the food which as promised served individually on about 80% of the offerings down to the salads which honestly were a nice highlight with the interesting varieties. Everything was clean, well presented and seemed to be prepared with a little more thought in terms of flavor with items such as chorizo enfuesed salmon, braised short ribs, and even a mac n cheese bar which was certainly a first for me. Even with all the eye candy of the food it was unfortunately lacking in flavor just like your typical buffet food that i have experienced. The carving station salmon and chicken were dry as the Mojave. The mac n cheese station was too much cheddar, can you say cheese with a side of noodle. And i think what stood out most for the night of negatives was the very bitter flavored lamb ribs on the Asian station that seemed almost like a black bean coating of some sort. \nOf course its not all bad, highlights were the ceviche although needing more shrimp still very fresh and flavorful, the interesting salad combinations, the leg of lamb on the carving station, the braised short rib, and the desert bar was stellar. Fudge oh so creamy, the choco strawberries everybody is talking about and i especially liked the peanut butter cookies that had something like chopped reece's cup sprinkled on top. \nYou know in the end there is just far better food in this city to be had for $30 a head at dinner. I mean if your mission is to stuff your face to the point where it hurts your tummy then have at it here at Wicked Spoon sure. But your dollars can have better quality food at many of great restaurants on the strip and easily be satisfied with a good meal and service at the same price if not cheaper depending where you go. Im by no means a food snob but at $30 a head id like some quality over just a nice presentation. \nOh and one other big plus is the rest room inside the actual buffet i noticed. Thats something you dont see at other buffets or restaurants here in Vegas."
1,"Big portions and cheap. Small location expect wait $15 min credit card charge. Pineapple Fried rice, Radna, and Pad Kee Mao wasn't great..  It would suffice as a hangover cure, only if you're able to drive here.  It's a bit far off the strip where Chinatown is.  I've had better Thai places. They were however super nice enough to accept reservations though."
1,"I really hate to give this place two stars, but our to-go order had so many mistakes and poor execution that I had to post. Pluses included tamale, flautas and sides. The server who helped us was great, but then I opened the food at home. Fajitas were wrong order( ordered double beef and got single beef/ chicken )and had lots of gristle/connective tissue. Most dishes were mushy due to lettuce next to/ under them and grease/ fat. Shrimp with chipotle was overwhelmingly spicy and strong with lots of grease. Ordered sopapillas which were missing. Perhaps things are better when you order in restaurant, but they really need to improve to-go quality and execution."
0,"DISCRIMINATION. No joke. A fews things to  think about before signing a contract with planet fitness:\n1. THEY DO NOT HAVE SCALES- I understand the whole \""judge free zone\"" but come on a big part of getting in shape is knowing how much you weigh so you can see how much body fat you are losing. Extremely frustrating that I can't see my progress on my weight. \n2. DRESS CODE- Today I was approached by one of the employees saying that my \""low cut tank top\"" is not allowed to be worn. They said it goes along with the \""NO LUNK RULE\"" I am a 20 year old female, I'm pretty sure you don't need to worry about me being a lunk? They said that this is warning and next time I will not be allowed to come into the gym. WHO CARES what Im wearing I'm there to work out not go to a fashion show.\n3. They serve pizza and bagels??? I mean COME ON I'm going to the gym to lose weight not gain more?!? \n\nThis place is just downright cheesy and annoying."
3,"Fine dining, romantic atmosphere. Great steaks, exceptional bone-in filet mignon. Definitely a place to come back for more!"
4,"Great calamari, lamb dish was excellent and I regularly go here for Sushi.  Jimmy the sushi chef will customize what you request and won't disappoint!  Be sure to top him he works hard!\n\nAs for the review by Luna seems to have the only negative review and it seems quite biased.  Perhaps works or owns a competing restaurant?"
1,"service: terrible\nview: amazing\n\nwe went there for few drinks with friends. we climbed alll the way up (there are two levels to the terrace) where there was a bar in the middle, a seating area on one side of the bar and a pool with some chairs and tables around it. we were in this small seating area for a long time before we realized that this area is not served by staff and we have to walk up to the bar to get the service. \nlater in the night there appeared a waitress who was actually serving the area. but the girl at the bar was very unfriendly and not polite to us when we asked why is there no service in our area. she yelled at us to pay for the drinks from the bar and after we refused to tip her she came up to us and had a long discussion with one of us to make sure we pay her the tip.\nNext time we'll just come up to the terrace - take pictures and leave."
0,We drove all the way from Raleigh (3 hour drive) to eat at this place. We came at 9:00pm thirty minutes before closing. There were quite a few customers in there at the time. As we walked in an older lady shouted we are closed to us and shoo-ing us out the door. We were all upset and about to leave then she throws a paper at us telling us hurry up and order standing there rushing us saying come on hurry up and order. We did not drive all the way to charlotte for this kind of service so we left and didn't even get to eat. We did not appreciate being rushed and forced to order something quickly especially if it's our first time here.
0,"I live in the Northwest area of town and right down the street from this store. I went in this store today for the 1st time and for the last time! I will NEVER return to this store EVER! By far the worst customer service I have EVER experienced! Walked by 3-4 store associates and not a single \""Hello\"" or \""Can I help you find anything?\"" It was just a big ball of negativity the moment I walked into this store. Clothes was okay quality not very high but then again for the prices what can you expect. Attention management definitely look into your employees lack of customer service skills. Unless that's the type of business you want to manage which I highly doubt your corporate company would agree with. I will not be returning here and I will advise others to also stay away!!!"
0,"Wanted to love this place since it is owned by Israelis, and good Israeli style food is hard to come by in the Phoenix area. However, the wife and I both ordered the falafel pita and the pita was half empty. Only had 3 falafel balls with a little Israeli salad and tahini. The pita was ok. Not like fresh Israeli pita. The meal came with a mixed leaf salad on the side that had a olive oil/lemon dressing. Not that great as it was pretty dry. We got our kid the Mac n cheese and side of veggies. We also got a mushroom hummus with toasted pita for appetizer. You would expect a meal like this to only cost about $25. But it ended up costing us about double that. Needless to say that we love to support the local fellow Jewish community, but not after that ripoff of a meal. We won't be coming back. Hopefully the owner realizes that he is being too cheap on his customers because he seemed like a nice man when he came up to our table to say hello."
3,"Saw this place on Bar Rescue and happened to be going to Vegas the following weekend. We wanted a change-up from the touristy scene so we came to Bar 702. Lisa the manager was very friendly and working her butt off!\nI sat down and played video poker for about 20 min, doubled my money, then got some drinks and listened to the band. My friend enjoyed her cocktail; I cant' remember the name of it but it was tasty.\nThe band was ok...I thought they could have played a few more hits as opposed to Allman Brothers deeper tracks but they weren't terrible.\n\nThe place was tough to find in the strip mall that it was located in, and we didn't order any food either but if you want a place off the beaten touristy areas and you are a fan of dive bars and live music you will enjoy it here..."
2,"I went here tonight with my co-workers for our holiday meal and there was 9 of us.\n\nThe setup is pretty simple - you have 4 stages of your meal which are salad bar, meat, dessert, and checkout. These states are dictated by your table by a round peg with different colors on it.\n\nBeing with 9 dudes we all decided that we were there to eat meat and more meat so we immediately turned the peg to green (for meat). This must have thrown off the staff because we all sat there for 10minutes twiddling our thumbs waiting for the meat skewers to come out.\n\nI think they wanted us to go get salad... because filling up on salad and a little meat is FAR less expensive than eating 5 pounds of meat per dude.\n\nFinally they caught on and started bringing meat out. We kept them busy but still they were slow. I am generally a slow eater and I could pretty much gobble up my meat before they even got around the table. Then... you'd have to wait 2-3 minutse for the next skewer to come out. So everyone spent a lot of time staring at an empty plate.\n\nThis isn't bad if you want to chat, which we did, but at the same time we were there to eat. As time goes on, food settles and you get full... so again, we were there for business and wanted more before it settled.\n\nWith that said, most of us went home stuffed. One guy could have stayed for another 4 hours, especially at the pace they were going at.\n\nThis was the first time I went to a Brazilian Steakhouse so I can't compare. A few of the other guys had gone elsewhere before and I believe they said that other places were better. I thought the food was decent but nothing I was absolutey dying for nor writing home about. I think everyone else felt the same."
3,"Pomegranate wheat beer, yes please!  This is a great little brewery, and a very chill spot to hang out.  I'll warn you they don't have food, but you can bring your own or order from one the local restaurants for delivery.  I would definitely recommend you do the tasting flight. It's a great price and you can try a selection of beers.   Then if you're still thirsty you can pick your favorite beer to order.  Looking forward to my next visit, and hoping to see this sold in AZ liquor stores soon!!"
1,Thumbs down!  Low quality overpriced food.  Can't say much about the service everybody else got but my waitress disappeared every 15 minutes.  Total time wasted from beginning to end of my meal for two people was 70 minutes.  Too long for a burger and chicken sandwich.  Nothing special here.  Will not return.
0,"The food was not good.  I mentioned that to the manager and he became rude, very rude.  I wouldn't let my dog eat there.  Sorry, but I can't tell how rude that guy was.  Good luck if you eat there.  My bill was a healthy 300 dollars."
4,"Every time I go here I find something unique and very well-priced.  It is enjoyable and the service is great.  I only meant to browse but I ended up spending a whole evening in this store because they carry home furnishings as well.  I just could not leave.  The collections are unique and varied from diffusion lines of high-end brands to high-end brands.  They carry almost the same stuff as Holt Renfrew but I never feel out of place.  They make brand name accessible and not reverential as they do in Toronto  I like that approach very much.  \n\nThe service is very friendly.  I asked for help to get a dress out of the mannequin and they quickly accommodated.  Eventhough I did not end up buying it they did not give me any grief about it.  I wish I had more hours to spend in this wonderful store.  Maybe it was not meant to come to Toronto because the cutthroat retail of TO will blemish its European flair.  I understand so until my next trip to Montreal, I will save my pennies so I can spend it contentedly on this great establishment."
2,"The new revitalization of downtown and Fremont St. is thrilling.  I went to high school downtown and that entire place holds so much magic for me.  It's really refreshing to have new destinations down there besides the Beauty Bar and Jillians.  I was tres excited to visit the new Downtown Cocktail Room.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed.\n\nFirst of all, it's hard to find the door; and it was the first place we went all evening so everyone still had their wits about them.  The DJ had to shine a light on it from the inside, and even then it still looked like a panel of plywood covering a broken window. \n\nThe interior is wonderful.  Dark, cozy, and intimate, reds and tans and chrome intermingle with candlelight and interesting art.  However, that first glimpse was about as much excitement as the venue offered.  I can definitely see this place being excellent for a two person chit-chat-a-thon - it just wasn't suitable to our 5 person strong group who felt like whooping it up for the evening.\n\nThe weirdest thing about this place are the stalls in the ladies' restroom.  I, of course, have no idea about the men's, but the treatment on the stalls gives them a slight two-way-mirror effect (you can see right out when you're inside) HOWEVER you can see right through them from the outside if you're close enough - and close enough is just where the sinks are located.  I feel close to all my sisters, but I don't know if I want to feel THAT close."
2,"Everything you'd expect from a high end casino's buffet: Huge selection, decent quality foods, and overpriced admission.  I'm not saying that it was a bad experience; On the contrary, I enjoyed my visit.  But to me, in the end the food doesn't justify the price.  I'll elaborate.\n\nAs I mentioned, the food selection is quite extensive and diverse.  It seems every major nationality and ethnicity is represented somewhere in the buffet.  I'll use my gluttony as an example: My first plate consisted of asian-style stir fry and meats, with rice and an Asian soup.  My second plate was build-it-yourself tacos, with middle eastern style doughy stuff and meats.  My third plate was typical American, steak and trip-tip with potatoes and corn. The dessert section is fairly large too- lots of gelatos, cakes, and other sweet treats.  Overall, most of the food quality would range between very good to excellent.\n\nNow, even though the buffet is tasty and diverse, I still have a few negatives I can't quite get over:\nPrice- The buffet is great, but it's quality isn't much different from other buffets on the strip.  For example, the quality equals that of Planet Hollywood's buffet, and PH comes in at around $10 cheaper per person, with a shorter wait time. Which leads me to my next point...\nService- If you come during meal times, you're going to wait.  Unless you're a VIP, you wait to pay and wait again to be seated.  From the time we got in line until we got seated took about 40 minutes, which is kind of crazy for a lunch.  And after you're seated, if you're thirsty you are at the mercy of a server and must wait for beverages and refills. Which in our experience, was very lacking and slow. I went through two plates of food with an empty drink, and only received a refill when I flagged down a different passing server. \n\nSo in conclusion, the food was very good and the selection was great.  The price was steep and the service lackluster.  Next time I do a Vegas buffet, I'll probably try somewhere else where the cost is a bit more in line with the value."
2,"Came here randomly bc we had celebrated our V-day dinner on Sunday and had time to kill before watching Phantom of the Opera.  We were surprised we could get a seat with no reservations.\n \nThey were understaffed for a 'holiday' night.  Our server was running around like a headless chicken and I felt bad.  The table that was finishing up when we were sat were rude and impatient, and the server seemed so flustered.\n\nMaybe it's because we had just dined at Joel Robuchon the night before..Maybe it's because we only had 10 min to eat after our entree arrived before we had to dash over to catch our 9:30 show.  But it didn't meet my expectations.  Nothing was amazing, nothing stood out.  I had the gnocci which was good but not to-die-for.  A. had the flat-iron steak which was pretty good, but honestly we ate so quickly I couldnt really tell.\nI want to say that it was my state-of-mind, plus being understaffed at Valentines day--my review may be biased. \n \nMaybe I should try it again another time. *shrug*"
0,"We came in for lunch with a $20 Yelp Deal.  The restaurant was located on W Sunset Rd/S Decatur Blvd in a gas station strip mall in Las Vegas.  There is a partition in front of the bathroom door.\n\nThe server gave us the dinner menus and he did not ask for our drink order..  The prices were really expensive.  My friend went up to the counter and asked if they had lunch menus.  There was one other couple having lunch.\n\nA female server took our order.  My friend ordered the Schweine Schnitzel and I ordered the Bockwurst.  Another couple walked in and sat behind us.\n\nThe female server came out of the kitchen and served  the couple behind us 25 minutes after we sat down.  They did not recognized what they had ordered.  The server went to the window at the kitchen and talk to the chef.  I heard her say she gave the food to the wrong table.  \n\nShe never came back to our table to appologize or offer us a free appetizer or beverage while we waited for our lunch.  How could she server the other couple our food!?\n\nThe male server brought us our food about 9 minutes later.  He did not say anything about the mix up either.\n\nThe Bockwurst was tasty.  The fried potatoes had pieces of crisp bacon.  The red cabbage was okay.\n\nThe Schweine Schnitzel was breaded.  There was no sauce or anything on it.  The  scoop of German potato salad was served cold.\n\nThe male server asked if we saved room for dessert.  My friend mentioned the mix up and asked for a free strudle.  He only offered us one.  \n\nThe Apple Strudle was served heated with a side of whipped cream and unsweeted cream in a dish.  It was the best part of the meal, but did not make up for the attitudes of the servers."
2,"Had this place for lunch today. It was a little busy. Nothing to spectacular about the place. Had the pho. It was ok, about the norm for Arizona. Prices were about right. I'd say this place is average."
1,"This was attached to our hotel (the Monte Carlo) and looks pretty cool from the outside.  However, if you are going to lure people in with drink cards for $3 margaritas, it's my experience that if you want them to stay for more, these should be pretty good even if you are giving them away cheap.  Not the case here.  Probably one of the worst margaritas I've had, it was almost like their sweet and sour mix had gone bad.  Tasted very strange.  The view of the strip from their upstairs deck is cool, and we probably would have stayed for another, had the drinks been decent, but they were not.  Decent service.  There were at least 2 bachelor parties here at the time, also."
2,"The place looks great and I love the beer. The food looks great but it doesnt taste great.... it's usually overly salted. like calm down with the salt shaker.\n\nI like that they offer $2 mini beers so that you can try multiple. That's a-okay in my book. \n\none last thing... what's up with the waiters? ALL of them! They've all got the personalities of awkward engineers.  I actually was so certain our waiter was an awkward engineer that I asked him if he was a student at U of I.  Imagine my surprise when he said he studied library sciences. WAAAAH?\n\nAnyways, moderate place for food, good place for beer, awkward but polite service."
0,"Met a friend this morning at 10am.  I was going to pick up a bagel and then get my coffee next door at Starbucks, but I saw that Einsteins has an iced coffee carafe with refills so I just got my coffee here.  \n\nIt wasn't busy.  Bagel was tasty.  My drink was empty so I went up to refill my cup but the carafe was empty.  I went to the counter and let the guy know that there was no more iced coffee.  He tells me that he'll take care of it.\n\nI wait about 7-8 minutes and walk up to fill my cup... But it's still empty.  I remind the guy that there is no coffee and he says he'll take care of it.  \n\nI go back to my seat and talk some more with my friend.  I go back about 5-6 minutes later assuming that the ice coffee is ready... But still nothing.  \n\nThis time I go to a different employee and ask him if it's normal to wait 15 minutes for a refill of coffee.  His response is a shrug of the shoulders and \""sorry\"".  \n\nFinally 10 minutes later as we are leaving, they start brewing the ice coffee.  \n\nPoor service.  And extremely pathetic response to a customer issue.  Is nobody there empowered to say anything other than \""sorry, we'll take care of it\""????"
3,"This place has two walls of floor to ceiling tv's, two bars, an area for pool and darts along with lots of tables and high tops. \n\nI've mainly stopped in for karaoke, but they have a great menu. The pizza and wings are good. Drinks are well poured, and I've always gotten good service at the bar. You will see quite a few regulars if you go enough. They have a good sound system for karaoke!\n\nGreat place for good food and good times!!"
2,"My friends and I liked the music a lot better here than at XS, and I did enjoy the view of the strip from the roof top. However, that's were the good things end. The place was crowded and the floor was sticky as hell from spilled drinks and whatever else. There were multiple couples pretty much having sex on the dance floor... thought this was supposed to be a classy club."
4,The place is the best in Gilbert. I love the way you feel when your there.  Owner is Great!
0,Worst company ever. Just witnessed them shake down parents for money and deflate a bounce house and make a birthday boy cry... Unreal. Do yourself a favor and find another business. If I could give negative stars I would.
2,"We came here twice during our trip to Montreal and both times had a good experience! The first day was just for an afternoon drink and a snack; the skewers with the tomato, date, cheese, and basil are delicious and a nice treat to share. My sangria was a little 'shmeh' and definitely overpriced. We ended up there for lunch yesterday, a combination of escaping the torrential rains and satisfying hungry bellies. The chips and home made salsa as a starter were good, a large portion for $7 but the salsa wasn't super flavorful. My salmon tartar more than made up for it, however, a nice big portion filled with fresh herbs and paired with a rather loaded salad containing strawberries, beets, almonds, and grapes. The boys each had some sort of sandwich with sausage and saurkraut, which looked pretty hefty. It is a bit of a tourist trap but the food is tasty!"
0,"This chain was crap in Los Angeles, and they are crap here in Nevada. So Much for 2nd chances.  Good luck trying to get out of there without them trying to push some other cost onto the bill. They recently came up in the news in a sting operation where they were over charging customers for services not request etc. Stay away from this place."
4,"Pizza is yummy -- fresh and not greasy.  The beer selection is varied.   The  decor is welcoming.  The staff is really friendly.  I tried to come up with a more amusing review, but when a restaurant is fun and the food is tasty, there is nothing much to say except try it!!"
1,"Okay - I see alot of movies and although its very close to home I avoid this place and would rather drive to Rave or even South Point...on more than one occation i've experienced poor quality sound, unconfortable seats, dirty everthing, concessions not well maintained...if I'm paying $10+ for a ticket then it may as well be worth it...I'll drive to Town Square everytime."
0,"The service and food were so bland it ruined a chunk of my evening.  If one insists on going, I recommend having a Peroni.  There is no way they could screw that up.  Simply open and pour.  Oh, unless you have our server, who will look at you with disdain because you're not ordering a bottle of wine."
4,Love their service I browsed through many other shops and none could compare.\nI had many questions and Greg was so QUICK and straight forward replying to me by e-Mail\n\nI purchased:\nThe 4 Dozen Red Roses Ultimate Elegance Premium Long Stem with a Medium size Teddy Bear.\n\nAnd she loved them \nI couldn't be happier \n\nI would recommend anyone to do business with them.\n\nAlso the delivery person was quiet polite and nice.
4,"What a delicious unique restaurant.. Not unique because of the food but because of the environment and the service.  Food - It's Mexican food.  All you have to do is close to right and it is delicious.  They easily took care of that.  I have the Johnny Carnitas Tacos and they were amazing.  The service is what blew me away.  They really know how to take care of the customer.  We sat in the bar area and were immediately greeted and our drinks were taken care of.  They told us all about the margarita options and the servers knew all everything about the dinner choices.  It was truly a wonderful experience that I look forward to experiencing again.  Tip top service, beautiful surroundings, and excellent food.  You wont be disappointed.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."
2,"Cool ambiance with the dim lights, tufted leather booths, back entrance thru the kitchen.\n\nService was acceptably attentive.\n\nGood food, at least for lunch when we were there. I had the ham, Brie and apple sandwich, except I subbed turkey for the ham and it was excellent. Fries were good, a little overdone. Sweet potato fries did get rave reviews from the other people in my group. Burgers are MASSIVE. \n\nPrice was perhaps a little high for a lunch of sandwiches/burgers, but the quality of the food was definitely not lacking."
2,"Decent, cheap, and quick pretty much describe O-E. I generally get take-out coming back from a long day of lab work at CMU, and it always hits the spot. It's normally only a 5 minute wait to grab food and go. Outside of a few staples (sesame crispy beef/chicken), I've been disappointed by trying a whole bunch of different options on the menu.\n\nThis place is better than some other items along Craig Street, but it's certainly not the best. As long as you don't go in expecting anything other than fast Chinese cuisine, you'll probably be disappointed."
4,"A bit hard to find, but its a gem and totally worth it! I got the club sandwich and it was great! All the meat is fresh and very good! Definitely will be returning again soon!"
1,"Independence Blvd. has gone to the crapper in recent years and this former Harris-Teeter is the epitome of the downward spiral.  Don't get me wrong-I kinda like Compare Foods and I'm not one of those snobs who complains that a place is \""ghetto\"" just because it operates in a low-income neighborhood.  Still, the atmosphere at this particular store trumps any redeeming qualities of the CF chain.\n\nYou can count on this Compare Foods for quality produce and canned products from all over Latin America.  The buck stops there. There is a strange odor in the air that you don't smell at other stores.  The cashiers are curt and the shoppers are very aggresive here. \n\n I've visited on several occasions and been solicited by panhandlers and nearly run over in the parking lot.  For some reason, they opened a  Compare Foods on Sharon Amity North that is a stark contrast from this bad boy.  No crowds, no funny odors, no panhandlers (I'm sure they're, just haven't run into them), no crazed drivers in the parking lot.  This tienda es muy terrible!  Unless you shop at TJ Maxx, avoid this shopping center all together!"
3,"I became a regular here, although admittedly I dreaded going sometimes because the cigarette smoke filled atmosphere is slightly unbearable. I'm a tough cookie, and Big Dog's holds a special place in my heart because they do beer, food, and service really well. That deserves my business everyday.\n\nThe beer is pretty good. I stumbled upon the local/craft beer scene and the city of Las Vegas royally sucks for anything besides Budweiser products. I love every menu item I've tried. Cheese curds! The twice baked wings are delicious, and they even have veggie burgers :-) Great menu, overall.\n\nService here rocks. I never sat at the bar, but always at a table next to it. I've had a few different waitresses, all superb. My beer never was less than a quarter full before I was asked for refills, and no matter how long I sat there drinking the service was consistent. Five stars, if a smoker didn't always sit right next to me."
2,"I was here on Friday August 21,2009\n\nI was starving as I arrived to Palms Place Hotel, straight from my early morning flight.\n\nMy first time @ Palms Place, (pretty snazzy place) \n\nSimon has a really nice chic appeal I LOVED it!\n\nmet my girlfriends @ Simon for a bite. Got there just in time to order......45 minutes later! Party of 4 got served ;-/ \n\nwe had the roasted chicken salad sandwich, black angus burger with tuscan fries, margherita pizza & classic caesar salad \n\nfood had really nice presentation but was cold by the time it reached our table. (an apologetic waiter) i may add. \n\ndon't know what the hold up was all about. it wasn't busy at all.\n\nthe yogurt parfait looked SOO good but didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes.\n\nI would return and edit my review :)"
3,"Many a day have been spent in this wonderful little park which, no matter the weather, lets you clear your mind and follow its paths for hours, escaping the bustling area of Bruntsfield for a while without having to actually leave Bruntsfield.\n\nSmack in the middle of these Links is a lonely looking bench which, if you're lucky enough to get on a hot day (the luck referring to the \""hot\"" part and not because there is usually a queue) I would suggest you grab a book or a paper and spend your day here, watching the world go by."
2,"I've noticed in my recent trips to the Forum Shops that they now have directories.  Thank God, because the info desk people are useless.  My husband went to ask them about the Total Reward gift certificate and they had no clue what he was talking about.  In the past, they were never able to give me good directions.  I would just have to take a map and figure it out myself.\n\nThe floor is made up of cobblestones with some weird, shallow trench down the sides. (Maybe in case the fountains break?)   It doesn't make for good walking in heels, especially when you end up in the trench.  But maybe I am just a klutz.  \n\nThe design of this place ensures that you walk by as many stores as humanly possible.  For example, the lower level is designed so you have to walk in a big circle past every single shop.  There is a perfectly good shortcut but it is blocked off with railings and a person to keep people from jumping the railing.  I'm not so fanatic about shopping or shortcuts that I'm going to crawl over a railing.  But still... it's annoying.\n\nThe selection of stores is good and the mall is huge!  Take a look at H & M.  It took over the old FAO Schwartz location and it is crazy!"
3,"This movie theater is your typical movie theater but for 1 night a month one room is turned into an outstanding great time when they show the Rocky Horror Picture Show accompanied by a live cast.  I know this event has been going on for ages around the nation but it is still fun to attend even after all these years. \nThe cast was great at interacting with the audience both during the performance and for the pre-show madness.  More can not be said as it would ruin the mystique if you've never attended. I recommend going at least once in your lifetime, and if you do be sure to dress the part. It makes it all that much more enjoyable.  \nThank you Jennifer O. for organizing a fun UYE. I had a great time."
0,"Glad to see people are catching on that this is an overhyped, overpriced sh-thole that have the most unfriendly, pseudo-hipster poser employees you can imagine working in a retail store. With the friggin' OUTRAGEOUS prices you'd think that the employees would be over-accomodating to try to make it such a great place, u don't mind spending what they ask, but NO!!!!...the perfect storm of crappiness: poor selection, high prices, sh-tty employees, pissy attitudes...LETS ALL GO RIGHT NOW!!!!!...:)"
2,"first time i have been here after my girl heard great things about it and i realized its the restaurant for the billboard i have seen on the way home many times on the 215. we had the special app burrata cheese with tomatoes. it was good but not heirloom tomatoes really? rookie mistake..cheaper with reg tomatoes but mistake for sure...burrata is amazing though, can't lie...also had the crab cakes it was a big portion size however, not great flavor and needs some work. had the spagetti and meatballs for dinner, noodles were good but not home made, meatballs were a big portion but not as good as lavo...for dessert the espresso cake, 1 word WOW!!! it was amazing and would go back just for that. also love the off the strip prices, the bottle of wine which was a ruffino was $42 which was a steal. great service as well, can't remember his name at the time but super friendly and helpful. \n\ngreat little feel inside the restaurant and will go back for that feeling. not the best food but will give it another try for sure. restaurant was packed on a tuesday night so clearly they are doing something right. seems like a local summerlin ritzy crowd. mostly old ppl and we were the only asians in the restaurant other than the ppl who were sat next to us. coincidence? not sure...haha"
4,"I like Lupie's - it is not high on the \""healthy quotient\"", but if you must deviate - there's no better place to do so. The bottomless nachos (took me 3 days to eat those) are great, good burgers. Let's just say if your watching any of those tricky health issues - cholesterol, weight, blood pressure - stay away. However, when you know you want to eat good, relatively inexpensive and alot - go to Lupie's!"
4,"Sweet God! \n\nThis self-serve yogurt shoppe has got to be my all-time favorite one EVER. This means a lot, because I'm a whatchmacallthat---a connoisseur of fine yogurt (lol). Seriously, I cant get enough of the wannabe, delicious, low or non fat cold goodness. Albeit I fall only and only for the tart versions, I've sampled the sweet ones enough to speak on their behalf as well. \nOmigod, lets start with the 'Original Tart'. Why?? Why must it be so cravably good? Its the perfect marriage of tart and sweet and they come together to form the most delicious flavor ever. Dont confuse this original with the originals from other yogurt shoppes, their is no comparison, like I said, I must've tried 90% of yogurt shoppes that open in Charlotte and surrounding cities, Sweet Frog is the ONLY one with the perfect package.  Now we proceed with the other awesome flavors: Vanilla Bean, Dulce DeLeche, Milky Way, Cappuccino, Pecan-Pie, Cinnamon Roll (!), Birthday Cake, Strawberry, Pomegranate, Mango, Red Velvet, Cookies n Cream and forgive me if Im forgetting any, but this is all I can remember. \nI always get the same trio, Original, Mango and Pomegranate. I always walk in wanting to try something different, so I sample them, but nothing can beat my lovely trio. The toppings, like Candyce mentioned above are limitless and very fresh. I think only the peaches are canned, but the rest are fresh. I dont like to weigh down my yogurt with toppings that get too cold and hard anyway, but those who do will definitely enjoy the candies, nuts, cookies, mochi and boba. They also have the frequent buyer card that they clip on each visit, and on Mondays, they clip it twice so you reach you 12th clip faster. Fill one card and get the 13th purchase free!! \n\nI actually got to know the lovely owner Michelle. She is so warm and caring and makes sure the place is pristine and polished at all times. All though its a self-serve place, you'll NEVER find a mess near the dispensers. All employees are always so polite and helpful, it makes going there that much easier.  I must pop in atleast 3-4 times a week because I am unable to eat solid food until doctors place a 'food tube' in my belly (long story......) so frozen yogurt, boost and ensure is what Ive been subsisting on.  It a few cents cheaper than other places, which is a great perk, since I walk out with enough for me to eat over the course of atleast 2 days. Im due to get my next batch tomorrow :D\n\nSo I urge you to visit Sweet Frog because you will then understand why my freakin review is so darn long! The Whitehall location is my personal fav, the ambience, the kindness and the deliciousness won me over :)\nIf you happen to meet Michelle (the owner) tell her 'the young lady with the walking stick' sent you, lol! (thats another long story involving 7 surgeries)"
2,"I've been wanting to go to SBL forever. Like, FOREVER. I just for some reason never did. Maybe I was just expecting too much but I was a little let down. This is not the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, oh no. It's not terrible (would rather eat here than Thai Place) but not stellar either.\n\nI started with fresh spring rolls, like I do at every Southeast Asian restaurant. They were out of shrimp so I got tofu. They were okay, but not enough Thai basil, and I didn't like that they cut them into pieces for you. The dipping sauce was good though.\n\nThe pineapple curry had a great flavor but not spicy enough for me. My major complaint with it though was the meat was just not good. The pieces of beef were small and had a rubbery texture. I'm not expecting filet mignon in my curry, but this was pretty bad. Some of my friends' dishes that I sampled were better, particularly the noodle dishes. But my curry was not up to par, and since I order curry about half the time I eat Thai, this is a matter of importance.\n\nI like the BYOB and the atmosphere is cute, but I'll stick with Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield."
4,"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed Coach House yet.  This is truly my favorite bar and always my 'go-to' spot.  Great location in old town but without the typical Scottsdale crowd.  Lots of parking.  Great bartenders.  Cheap and strong drinks (best combination).  Moderately sanitary bathrooms.  Crazy christmas lights and decorations.  \n\nIf you are lucky enough to go around the holiday season... it is literally like Santa threw up all over Coach House.  Lights, wrapping paper, ornaments, candy canes, shitty Christmas decorations up the ying yang.  Its wonderful.  I would not want to be the guy having to put up/take down all that each year.  \n\nEvery single time I go to Coach House, it is an awesome time.  Always meet interesting people and have actually made a few friends from my encounters there.  \n\nThe inside is fairly small with rickety tables but a great jukebox and arcade games.  Large outdoor area to meander as well. \n\n*BEST BAR IN OLD TOWN*"
4,"Fanstastic! The staff, especially Luanne are so friendly and the work the do is perfection!!\nWe take all or our household linens/sheets and they come out fresh, crisp\nand clean and no weird smells!!\nTry them, you will not be disappointed."
2,"Went here yesterday for my first Smash Burger experience. Over the noon hour is was quite busy but we had our food within about 10 minutes. This lunch hour wait is on par with In N Out next door. \n\nI had the BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger. It was pretty good but the application of BBQ Sauce was thin at best. For an extra topping I ordered jalapenos and they came out raw, I was expecting the pickled variety. I probably wouldn't have those again. I also ordered pickles as a topping and these were quite good, thick slices similar to a Clausen, not your typical hamburger pickle chips. \n\nFor sides we had the regular fries and fried pickles. The fries weren't bad, sort of reminded me of McDonald's, although I would have liked a few more. The fried pickles were not too good, pickles were sort of mushy (star deduction) For now I will stick to ordering my fried pickles at Memphis BBQ or Lucile's. \n\nSecond star deduction is the price. Don't get me wrong, the burger was good, but so is In N Out and for less than the price of one burger at Smash, I can get a whole meal at In N Out. I'll be back, but not often."
4,"Hoyt's Kajukenbo offers a great martial arts curriculum along with a family like environment for all students and supporters. Sifu Greg is a patient man and one to be greatly respected due to his vast knowledge and experience in training the art of Kajukenbo. The promotions are earned through hard-work and dedication, something that not many places offer nowadays, unless you chalk up the money. The full contact training prepares one for the realism that comes in actual street fights and other scenarios. If you want a place that doesn't teach a false sense of security, Hoyt's is the place to be."
2,"I was just there last week. It was about $15 for all you can eat bowl, I believe just one bowl was $13, so for the $2 extra dollars might as well go for it. Skip out on the appetizers, even for half off during happy hour, wasn't anything special. I took a quick peek at the soup & salad bar and it didn't seem to be worth it either, although I believe it's included in the unlimited bowl, not sure about that though. My other suggestion would be to put your veggies in the bowl first and then pile your meat on top. They have it set up so you do the meat first and then veggies, but I feel like unless you got mad skill, you end up not being able to put as many veggies in your dish and then your meal seems like it's missing something. Also, there's a huge selection of sauces and spices.. I kind of felt like it was overwhelming, because there were so many options and not really anything you could sample them with. So if you're not really sure of what you like or want, it was hard to try and figure out what would be good. I know on the menu they tell you some things that you can mix together for a certain taste, but it's not listed by the sauce section anywhere. First time up our griller was pretty good, but the second time the guy was too busy doing tricks that he didn't turn our food enough and it ended up being slightly burnt on the one side. Oh - what I thought was nice, is the waitress suggested that we get the unlimited for $2 and she'd box it up so we could take it home for lunch. So no matter what, you're taking something home. We went around 5, so it wasn't that crowded yet.. around 6 more people started coming and lines were formed at the tables and grill for a small wait (I know there were a lot of complaints about that when I read reviews about the place). Overall it was a good experience. Would I go back? Probably. I left feeling like it was convenient, something new.. but I felt like I could just make it at home."
4,"If I could give 4.5 I would.  Bumped up to five partially because there are very few restaurants like this in mesa.  By that I mean local,  non chain, nice decor.  Basically it has a Scottsdale feel in east mesa.  I usually get the calzone, it's enough for two to split and get full.  Don't get me started on the bread. .. the poor waiter always has to bring me a couple refills.  Pricy,  but not overpriced.  A good place to celebrate."
4,"We frequent here often since it's near our house. Great service and really good rolls. When we are not in the mood for all you can eat at oyishi down the road, we come here for great quality rolls. The sushi chefs are very friendly."
1,"Today was my 1st time eating here. After reading all the 5 star reviews we decided to try this place instead of going to fuddruckers. I'm sad we did. My husband and I both had burgers and were completely unimpressed. They were bland and we both had jalepenos on ours. The bread tasted stale. The fries were pretty good but the apple fries every was raving about. Meh. I left full but definitely not satisfied. I will choose fuddruckers next time for sure. No desire to return here. Oh and everyone also said the owner was really nice, not today. Who knows maybe he was having a bad day."
3,"This place was bomb dizzle fo shizzle nizzle. Lol. They had some damn good mac and cheese. i ordered the lolos special, i think it was the #3 anyway, the chicken was real tasty and so were the waffles. Bring a camera when you come to this place because it has a real novelty aspect to it, this place might be a 5 star, but my waffle house experiences are close to none existent but i will edit my review if need be once i frequent more of these type places. Oh and they give you your drink in a big kerr canning jar 'pretty cool'"
3,"This review is for the breakfast buffet only.\n\nWe waited 15-20 mins for breakfast, arriving around 8:30.  I didn't know vacationers in Vegas woke up that early!  \n\nThe selection was good for breakfast.  Omlettes, cereal, fresh fruits, baked goods, ham, bacon, other breakfast staples, and my personal favorite, crepes.  The orange juice was delicious, one of the best I've ever had.  \n\nThe ambience is charming.  It's an French outdoor theme, with the ceilings painted like the sky with clouds.  I enjoyed it.\n\nI probably will return on my next visit to Vegas."
2,"My update: Still holding at 3 stars firmly.\n\nI met up with a couple friends here last night for happy hour. Overall the place hasn't changed much, it's still the romantic ambiance and sexily dressed waitresses. Their happy hour prices for alcohol were great. I chose to get a Stella, my friends opted for wine. Our waitress was upbeat and attended to our needs very well.\n\nAs for the food, I'm just going to have to say... 3.5 stars. So, a little bump for their happy hour and food, mostly because the quesadilla had really good flavor and was very different from any quesadilla I've had. Unfortunately the quesadilla is not on the happy hour menu, to which I implore management - please put it on there! During the course of the night I also had the olives (meh), and the BBQ Pork Sliders (also meh, but kudos for the sweet pickles!). The bun was soft though, but overall I've definitely had better pork sammies. \n\nWill I return? Perhaps, when I'm in Town Square or if my friends happen to want to do happy hour here again. I am also interested in the Pre Fixe breakfast on Saturday and Sunday! So maybe I'll have to go back and try that out."
3,"We recently placed a delivery order for some pizza, our friend told us they had Chicago style pizza so we ran with it.  \n\nIt has been awhile since I have had Chicago style pizza I had forgotten how utterly over whelming it can be.  The pizza must have weighed 15 pounds and was over an inch thick with crust and toppings.  One piece and I was stuffed so three pieces in for the three of use and we are only slightly over 1/4 done!  Guess I'm having cold pizza for breakfast!  \n\nIt was spendy but the toppings were generous and tasty, the delivery time reasonable."
0,"Okay. I love chili's and my family always loved doing a quick chili's to go order for Friday dinner. Since moving with my fiance to this location, I haven't had that experience! Tonight we ordered 2 buffalo chicken sangwiches. Simple! We get home and we have breaded chicken sangwiches with mayo.....okay. the rest of the order is fine so I call back and re ordered. My fiance and I didn't get to sit down to eat till 10;30pm! And what do we find? Another chicken w/mayo with wing sauce on the side....one with wing sauce and nothing else. \n\nThese guys were not busy when I went in to the To Go entrance and seeing as they ruined this simple order twice within an hour, means they've got some pretty bad cooks, or some pretty bad attitudes. \n\nOh and the fries were cold both times. Like not even \""to go\"" cooled...we live 3 blocks from the place!"
3,"Still going strong and I am now seeing that they made this bar a very valued member of the community. The terras is as sunny as ever , and if there is a chilling wind the colourful Ikea blankets are a great warmer and wind breaker. \n\nThe bar is always busy, but many of them are familiar faces - they truly live up to the moniker 'local'. The prices have increased since last year, but so have those over many other establishements.\n\nThe beers served are global brand and local brew side by side, so a Kronenburg 1664 and a Blue Moon is perfectly possible. \n\nThey also have their own Swedish ciders called Iduns and this is a joy to drink over ice when catching some sunshine. \n\nThis is to me a friendly neighbourhood pub & restaurant with some international allure."
3,"Ralph's truck runs by my office in north Scottsdale almost every afternoon. NOTHING can beat the the convenience factor, instead of spending 15 minutes fighting airpark traffic to buy a crappy burger, I just roll out to the back of my building and order some fresh tacos. \n\nThe prices are pretty decent and the food quality is good (but look, it's still got a fast food element to it so we aren't talking gourmet but it's pretty decent!)\n\nThe cook and the driver are SUPER NICE and always have a great attitude when I see them. \n\nIf you see them driving around, flag them down for some yummies! :)"
3,The best burger I ever ate for sure!! The music is loud and it is always crowded and high energy. The patio is cool. The waitress' could smile but other wise the burger is awesome. The atmosphere is a party. Fish tacos are decent too. The only reason I really go is for the hamburgers. You would like it if you want to be entertained and are a people watcher.
0,"Very disappointing,  we both had the chicken panini, should have been called grilled bread panini.. We complained, we were told that they would have to charge us extra for more chicken? Seriously,  there was three small chicken pieces the size of your pinki. The red wine was warn? They did charge use for only one grilled bread panini and the hummus nachos are excellent."
4,"My girlfriend and I decided to use windwalkers after careful consideration of many horse ranches and experiences because they custom each ride for each rider. My gf is an extremely avid rider and grew up with many horses on her ranch in south africa. I am extremely amateur and could not post or trott the horse, but surely after this ride I was riding like a pro! Joseph,  the owner of Windwalkers,  was our guide and this man knows his trails and absolutely takes care of you, the horses and the trails. The ride was majestic from the beginning and even went over the 2 hour time frame which we absolutely loved to experience such great horses for longer. His horses are kept as family and are extremely well behaved. Jasper, was my black stallion who knew the trails! If you are wondering why there are little reviews it's because they don't get much business from the resorts but to me they were the BEST option and nothing else compares. Thank you Joseph!"
1,"If you are a rich bunny rabbit this is the place for you. I was not comfortable in this place. My problem, yes. Creamy tomato soup served cold: Disappointed. Crackers like tree bark: tasty but tough to chew. Sandwich of salad tasty but blah blah blah. We all should eat healthy. This place is expensive. I'm out. I'll make my creative salads at home and save $50.00."
4,Two type of services they offer... Full service (interior and exterior) and exterior washing.  First visit and impress with service. Car is extremely clean with a extra fee to clean bugs out for $5.00 which is fine with me.. Will definitely come back to get my car clean again.. Thanks guys for the awesome job..
3,"Frankly, I don't even know about all the hype or the national fame or whatever. I just went here on a friend's recommendation (and with a bunch of other people, but that's not so relevant).\n\nSprinkles is next to a plaza of sorts within the Linq. I think the easiest parking is probably the giant outdoor lot on Winnick Rd. off Koval, and when you walk through that end of the Linq, you'll get a good view of the giant ferris wheel. The store is pretty nicely decorated, brightly lit, and clean so far.\n\nAside from just following up on the recommendation, the crux of my visit was to capitalize on a sort of BOGO offer: buy a Cuban coffee cupcake ($3.75, standard price), whisper a secret passphrase (out of respect and because this is time-limited, I'll just say that it's on the national Sprinkles Facebook page), and get any other cupcake free. I chose dark chocolate on aforementioned friend's recommendation.\n\nFunny thing about a place named Sprinkles. They never asked me whether I wanted sprinkles on my cupcake. Only later did I learn that not only do the sprinkles not come by default (even though they're free), but the dark chocolate cupcake may be even better with the sprinkles, which are apparently more like flakes. Also, it seems that it's not the same person who takes your order as the one who takes payment, so I had to do that passphrase thing twice, which speaks to more communication issues.\n\nBut let's end this on a positive trend: if you have a sweet tooth, you will love these guys. Cuban coffee was delicious, with the coffee flavor concentrated in the lovely frosting. Dark chocolate was also great, and definitely not too sweet (at least in the non-sprinkle form). And I got to try a bit of a lemon cupcake which was just vibrant with flavor. Good times."
2,"I understand a burger joint probably is likely not going to cater very well to a vegan, but the guys at work wanted to go. I had a Boca burger which was quite plain. Nothing special. The waitress worked hard to make sure the food I got was vegan so that is why the rating is so high comparatively to the rest of the experience.\n\nIf you do eat meat you'll likely have a completely different impression of the place."
4,"Gotta big up local DJ Maybelline for puttin' me up on this dope Rockabilly steeze barbershop that I drive clear across town for. I've been through my fair share of barbers locally not to mention in my lifetime and these cats are among the coolest, most on point dudes to get your hair done did. \n\nSo while I may work in a kitchen, I have a great deal of respect for these dudes who like me are on their feet for 7+ hours all day, working with real sharp devices all while trash talking/carrying a conversation. Have you ever been to a barber (or salon) and you were just in and out thinking to yourself: \""damn that was fast\"" or, \""done already?\"" Well that's not the case with these dudes. They don't rush in other words, THEY TAKE THEIR TIME. Who the fu*k really does that nowadays? They do. No crazy designs. No half azz cuts. No BS. Just straight up nice tapers fades or probably whatever you want for that matter. \n\nI simply wish they had a location closer to me in the Southeast. PBRs are back so you can sip and get a little morning head change while waiting on one of the barbers if last nite drunken revelry wasn't enough to do you in. Straight razor finish always makes you feel like a million bucks and always makes my fu*kin' day. As of about a month ago (7.20.13) they added another barber so things can run more smoothly and you aren't waiting 2-4 hours to get chopped.. Well I'm lyin'.. depending on who you want to do you up the wait still might be 2-4 hrs. I almost dread giving this spot 5 stars on the count of creating more traffic and waiting over 4 hours *gasp*! \n\nI kid. Bottomline, these cats deserve all the men's cuts that there is to offer in Vegas."
2,"I updated my review from 4 stars to 3 stars.  The last time I went here for the BF's birthday the service was slow and the food was mediocre.  I guess having gone to Hong Kong and Taiwan has spoiled my taste for Chinese food state side.  Also our bill was almost $350 for two (including tax and a 20% tip).  I may have had a more satisfying meal at Panda Express (and more money in my wallet).  Sad to say.  I do want to try their Fountain's Brunch which is held every Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. for $55 bucks.  Not too bad considering that the buffet features assorted dim sum, fresh oysters and seafood, Peking duck, assorted western breakfast items, and more."
3,"Agreed with the review before mine: not the best Korean I've ever eaten (I grew up with a Korean mom and grandma) but absolutely the best in Arizona. Don't let the exterior fool you; the interior looks super similar to a restaurant in Korea. Sundubu, bibimbap, bulgogi are all tasty. Be careful: many of the dishes come out a little on the spicy side, even if you order medium heat. Side dishes are a little salty, but still tasty. Coming here is a real treat and I leave full and happy each time."
3,"Salad and Go: Okay, focus on Salads...but I am here to announce their breakfast is fast and filling...also decently healthy.\nGet the Peanut Butter Wrap-- yes you can make that in your home, but the point is that a delicious breakfast that won't make your pores greasy, is available for consideration.\nI will agree with the other reviews...if you get a salad it is a hit or miss regarding the meat. I have been here several times and it is a hit or miss. Sometimes I am surprised and pleased for the amount of chicken I receive, and then other times I feel my meat is playing hide-and-seek."
0,The management of this restaurant treats it's employees like crap. The food is mediocre at best. The yogurt (or whatever it is) is no where near as good as Dairy Queen.
0,"This place is trash. The guy at the door called me fat (uhh what, 110 pounds is fat? LOL okay). Then the short ugly manager wouldn't listen to me when I complained. He also told my friend she could pee outside when she said she had to use the bathroom.  Yeahhh ... Don't recommend."
0,We used to go here when it was Famous Sams  and it was tolerable.  Then we made the BIG mistake of going here when it became Max.  The service was bad and the food was worse.  I will not be going back here.  Famous Sam's was like that uncle you could tolerate because you could always rely on him to make you laugh with a joke full of words you probably shouldn't  be hearing.  Max is like the uncle in the corner that smelled kinda like he crapped his pants and never remembered to put his teeth in.  Just look away and pretend it doesn't exist!!!
0,"I ordered a Groupon from Aces and Ales, this was our first time visiting.  It started out okay, we ordered our food and drinks.  There was only one server at 5 pm, which I blame the management . Our food took an hour to get to us, and it was mediocre at best (if cold nachos and grossly overcooked chicken fingers qualifies as mediocre), and over priced.\n\nIf you want to watch a certain game, don't come here to watch your favorite team. We got moved to watch a game on a certain TV, and every 10 minutes the TV would turn off and wouldn't  come back on for another 10 minutes.  I asked a server to change the TV, which she told the bartender, who completely ignored her. \n\nI won't come back here."
0,"LAME.  LAME! LAME! Went with my significant other, couldn't help myself from laughing all the way through this...at all the bad acting and role playing we were expected to participate in.  Ridiculous waste of time and money.  Spent the whole time trying to find a way to exit / escape.  Was like a bad dream that you knew was just a dream, but you couldn't wake up from.  Should've known better when there was no one in line from the start."
0,"Came here for my first time for friday night dinner and waited for 10mins. for a host. Didn't get service even though the place was empty. We left. Get it together, it's a Friday."
4,"The food here is great. Love the burritos and lo-carb breakfast! The burritos have these awesome egg whites that are just perfectly cooked. \n\nThe breakfast buzz is probably the best shake I've ever tasted. It's also huge, so it's a better value than most. I love the mix of chocolate, peanut butter, banana, and coffee.\n\nAny time I'm in Phoenix I make it a point to go here."
1,"I had lunch at the Devil's Advocate today with a few friends. It wasn't terrible, but not great -- mainly because of the food.\n\nThe waitress was friendly and took our drink orders quickly, but then disappeared for a long time when we were ready to order food. I think she may have been the only waitress on duty, since she was helping people on the far side of the restaurant area. It was pretty slow, but that's stretching it a little thin.\n\nI ordered a BLT and sweet potato fries. Both sounded good, but didn't look so great when they arrived. The bread was grilled rather than toasted, so it was a little greasy and otherwise limp. I was happy that they served the mayo on the side, though a little cup of mayo is kind of unappealing to see. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, but the bacon was really odd. It was very similar to the kind of bacon you'd get in England, which is to say that it's sort of like Canadian bacon for pizza. Not crisp, greasy, stringy. Yuck. The sweet potato fries were pretty unappealing too. They were hot but limp and not particularly flavorful.\n\nThe ambiance and decor was good, so if you're wanting a drink, it probably wouldn't be an issue. I liked the comfy chairs around the bar, and there were TVs everywhere so it'd be a great place for watching sports. (They had a World Cup game on but the broadcast was in Arabic, which makes zero sense to me.)"
3,"I was in the mood to try a new place for breakfast and I checked Yelp and found this place.  It's a good distance from where I live, but why not drive a little to get a great breakfast, and that's just what happened.\n\nI like it so much when menus are posted online and I had already chosen the breakfast I was going to get.  When it came time to order, I took my server's recommendation and ordered the rib eye steak chilaquiles.  I chose the pot of bread instead of toast or biscuit.  The bread was good, but I wish it had more cinnamon.  That would have made it and outstanding breakfast accompaniment.\n\nThe main action was the spice rubbed rib eye steak--there was a small amount of rub flavoring--and it was done rare just the way I ordered it.  For the eggs, I got over easy which was put on top of the refried beans and chips of the chilaquiles.  The cotija cheese added so much flavor!  The eggs were topped with sliced avocado.  Very nice presentation.\n\nMy server, sorry I didn't note the name, was quite good.  The restaurant is not large and when I was leaving around 9:30, there was a wait for tables.  I think I'll go back sometime and get my original choice and compare the two!  I am glad I gave Rise & Shine a try!"
0,"Quite possibly one of the unprofessional baseball organization I've visited. The announcer didn't know how to pronounce the opponent's player's names, let alone the 51's players names. The concession stands had lines that people were cutting in right in front of ushers, yet nothing was being done. Lines were also slow. Ushers also didn't seem to care if someone was sitting in the seat you paid for. I had someone in my seat and the usher just told me to find another seat. Won't return to watch this team next time I return to Vegas."
3,"Yeah yeah, this isn't quite the Vegas you're set out to do... but I think this place is worth the price of admission.\n\nI've never been so close to dolphins and white tigers and a white lion in my life.  It's such a treat and special.  I can't believe I was only about 3 feet from a dolphin here.  He came up and just lounged for a bit, swam around and looked at me.  I wasn't a huge fan of dolphins before this trip, but wow, if only I could always be so close!  Makes me want to be a trainer.\n\nI was lucky to see a training session (which aren't really scheduled) and learned a bunch about these sea mammals.\n\nNice break from the Vegas hoopla."
4,"Came here last Thursday night for the 10:00 PM showing. I was visiting Vegas for the first time with a friend, and she got us the tickets. We had great seats! Front row right hand side. \n\nO was like any other Cirque show, in that it is hard to give them anything but glowingly positive reviews. The show is an experience, and you are happy to be there.\n\nI have now been to 4 Cirque shows, and O stands out as the most visually stunning. The art design and set, trump any of the other shows I have seen, even if the acrobatics, and other acts are not as spectacular.\n\nThe opening scene, and the whole experience, was stunning, and drew me in to a beautiful realm of intrigue and magic. I even got teary eyed. I really enjoyed going to this show, and consider it an experience that I am glad to have had.\n\nDefinitely check out one of the most spectacular Cirque shows around.\n\nAny Cirque show you see becomes a magical and memorable experience."
4,"Been eying this place for awhile but its always sooo packed that I hate waiting  when I'm hungry!  So this Saturday morning we decided to order takeout, ready in 10 minutes= AWESOMENESS! \nThe only complaint I have is my husbands omelette was supposed to be eggwhites but wasn't. EVERYTHING else was DELICIOUS!  You can definitely tell the ingredients were fresh and  homemade! Their bread was sliced thick, OJ was  soooo yummy and the BlackBerry FrenchToast was sweet but with the sourdough bread/zest not overwhelming! Plus the bacon was crispy just the way I love it!\nCannot wait to try something new next time we go! Maybe we'll try lunch next time!"
1,"If you're going to the Pearl and have assigned seats, I'm guessing that you'll have a good time because it's not a huge venue and you probably have a good angle from whereever you're sitting. \n\nIf you are someone like me who is determined on being as close as possible in the pit, then you might need to reconsider going to shows here because it's disorganized and dangerous the way they handle people who want to be in the pit. \n\nFirst off, you can't line up early. That's not a big surprise because I think most places in Vegas are like that. So you're bound to either wait around the casino, pretending to play at the nickel and quarter slot machines or just keep going back and forth till you see the door opening. \n\nWhen the door opens, it's a big rush of people speeding through doors to get checked and scanned. Then you line up to the right side where the stairs are. After the door to the stairway's opened, the staff tells you not to run, but of course, everyone runs down the stairs and it can get crazy with people pushing down to get through. I think there must've been at least five to six flights of stairs. Once you make it to the bottom, they break the crowd up into two groups and it's all a matter of luck to see if your group will be the first ones inside to race to the very front. \n\nSo regardless of getting there early, you can still get screwed on getting to the front. I'd rather watch shows at the Joint at Hard Rock."
0,"Go to the buffet - trust me you'll get more bang for your buck.\n\nWife and I had breakfast here on morning when the line for the buffet was longer and we thought we wouldn't spend as much on breakfast. Wife ordered biscuits a gravey and I had french toast. Wife's arrived and looked good except for the still-cold shredded cheese on top. It wasn't melted at all. I think my french toast came from the same batch as what was served in the buffet. On top of that, our server was completely \nunpleasant. The coffee sucked too.\n\nSeriously, if you want breakfast, go to the buffet."
1,Not impressed with the service. Waited too long and it wasn't busy? Stood around and watched them talk to their friends.  I wanted to try it because I heard it was good but the flavor was just ok. I guess I expected better by reading all these great reviews. I think people believe that its more healthy by eating here but are you willing to pay for it? Not healthier because they put extra granola on things!!!There are other places that have better service and quality. I will try other places and don't see myself returning. I will get my juice at Wholefoods.
3,"its called little buddha, not \""little buddha cafe\""\nI eat Sushi about 4 times a week.  Little Buddah has the BEST spicy tuna rolls in vegas..close second is sushi roku at fourm shops.  Also, their yellowtail sashimi with ponzu is gorgeous, fresh and delish...\nOK, this is a fact....best lobster in town...it is grilled and perfect...not chewy, sweet....its perfect..kicks delmonicos ass...no joke\nThe decor and vibe are great, i can't comment on other dishes b/c i am a pescatarian and havent tried any other meat dishes..enjoy..im serious about the lobster"
2,"The three stars are for the friendliness of staff and the location, it is close to work for me and makes it easy to stop in. The store is nice and always clean, though I've never sat in it for an extended amount of time. I'm typically out of there in ten minutes. \n\nBut, the actual drinks there are not very good to me. The tea lattes taste like sweet milk. I don't know what the powder is that they add to the drinks, but it tastes fake to me. Everything is really just too sweet, even when it's sugar free. Maybe it's just my taste buds. If you are looking for a local place, I suggest cartel down the street."
1,"I don't know how people can eat here...I guess it's an AZ thing. I had their Cali Burrito & rolled taquitos. \n-Cali burrito: I like that they put lots of guacamole in it, but the meat was bland. As if it had been sitting in water before they cooked it. I stopped eating it because it was starting to gross me out.\n-Rolled taquitos: nothing special just plain old rolled taquitos. They were a $1 so I guess that was nice. A little confused as to why people like this place, But hey whatever floats your boat."
3,"Really enjoyed this hawaiian restaurant!  Great, friendly service.  The coconut ice cream shake is amazing."
0,"Not a fan! food was overpriced and mediocre at best! IMO go to HOLSTEIN's if you want a good burger! this was eeeehhh , even if they give you a free mac n cheese fried balls for checking in, still wouldnt go back!"
3,"I had the berry gelato. It was sooooo good!! Very fresh and perfect for a hot day outside! It taste very fresh and i can tell they use quality ingredients. My niece had the mango gelatto and for me not liking mango, hers was also VERY good and tasted surprisingly just like biting into a real mango. would definitely recommend and return!"
3,"The only thing you can say critically about the Thai House is the location isn't a home run.  But get past that, and get inside because the food is top shelf and the recepies are authentic making this a fave five spot for my family.  Start with a Thai Iced Tea, try a spicy soup, and don't miss the curry - but beware of the heat index and order according to your ability to enjoy flame in your flavor!  My personal favorite is tradtional Pad Thai - the perfect balance of peanut and chili spice with sticky noodles & chicken..."
3,"I happen to live near this place and I only tried it for the first time 1 month ago. There is a wait time about 20-30 minutes usually. Cute decor feels retro. They offer free \""hot chocolate\"" type shots to start which is nice. I ordered their yogurt and my husband has the grilled cheese with duck. I love my plate as well as their coffee. The grilled cheese lacked some cheese and only had duck in the middle and a small portion. Id go back to try different things. The staff is friendly. Still a decent breakfast place compared to a lot"
4,"I used to work just a ways down the street on 16th St and McDowell and a coworker and I would frequently place pick up orders here. I've tried a few different sandwiches, and they were all good, but my all-time favorite sandwich is their peanut butter & jelly sandwich. I know it's hard to go wrong with a PB&J, but seriously... it is heavenly. The bread is always nice and warm (and toasted) and with the PB&J on warm and toasted bread it just creates this great flavor combination that is to die for. I sadly don't work near them anymore, so I will definitely come down here just for the PB&J!! :)"
3,"So many choices on the menu, dont know where to start.  The food was excellent.  Minus one star because the service was super bad.  We placed our order and it literally took over 15 mins to get our food.  On top of that the table next to us got their food before ours but we arrived way before them.  So that kinda ruined my appetite.  Actually, not really.  I still inhaled the whole platter.  Right after a good day at the Mandalay wave pool, Hue Thai is the spot to eat :) Lots of seating provided.  Price is also reasonable.  Forgot to take photos of my food, because i was so hungry.  Had to eat, before I start throwing a BF!"
0,Food is good. But roach crawling on wall but disgusting. \nService can be improved
3,"Yay for an Express store at Paradise Valley Mall!!! I love love love the clothes at Express since they are fitted and super stylish.\n\nFound a pair of cropped pants for $30. Since the red-line items get an additional 30% off, I walked away happy with $21 pants! WooHoo! Another article of clothing to add to my business attire."
1,"Paris Las Vegas, What a disappointment!  All was going well until we came back from a show and the parking structure at Paris was full and we were rudely told we could not park in our own hotel structure and that we had to park all the way to Planet Hollywood. Which was far for walking distance and we were so tired.  By the way we were not allowed in a parking structure that was full but yet had tons of cars coming out of it AND the guy was rude. wow..why? I believe in treating people how you want to be treated and I doubt these workers want to be treated that way on their vacation. So we go ahead and speak with a manager named Sebastian at the front desk and state our concerns... I am saying names so you all know this is a true story. Sebastian gave us a look like \""I just work here\"" and the \""well I can't do anything even though I am a manager\"" talk. He tried to pawn us off on some 800 hotline, like that was gonna help. He really didn't care. I get it Sebastian that you probably hear it up to your ears all day about complaints but what about us happy go lucky people that really deserve to be heard and feel that yes, great customer service does exist?  Just reliving that whole experience after we stayed an extra night for 100 dollars plus resort fees is just so unbelievably tragic to understand how you had no consideration for us. Let me not forget to mention that we fell asleep waiting for room service and that when it finally did arrive, my salad was so bad in taste it scarred me to ever like bacon again..BACON..bacon is sacred and now I don't care for it because your bacon dressing was not appetizing. The tower was cool.....at a price. I had to at least say something nice."
2,"Dos has lost a lot of its appeal from years back.  It used to be the day drinking capitol of the world but now there's hardly anyone there during weekend days.  It's got that Rocky Point vibe which is supposed to be dirty and a little run down but I think they're taking that a bit far.  It doesn't look like it's been renovated in decades.\nCorona's used to be $2 anytime which made it our starting spot but they have since gone up as well.  I think they're up to $3 which is pretty much the same thing so no big deal.  \nI think the shift away from Craftsman Court and the west side of Scottsdale road to other more popular streets is what has made the crowds disappear, not necessarily any huge thing they're doing wrong here."
3,"Great burgers\nGood Fries\nFriendly staff and atmosphere. Next to 24 hours fitness.. \nMy post work out meal. Yeah, I now...its counter productive."
1,"Marbella was one of those restaurants for me that you wanted to try, but at the same time you weren't so sure on pulling the trigger by going. Suddenly a LivingSocial appeared and it seemed that I had little to lose to try it out!\n\nWalked in and saw that it was busy! Couples everywhere, if you're one of those couples that like to make fun of the lovey dovey stuff that others do, then this is your place to be a creeper. The environment is definitely not somewhere I would eat with my dad, especially if they have instrumentals of love making songs playing. Waiting a few minutes at the hostess stand was not a big deal, it either meant they were busy touching tables... or inattentive. \n\nDuring my experience I had to wait less than 10 minutes on a Friday night for a table, not bad! The food was \""okay\"", definitely did not experience any stand outs and the same applies to the Sangria. The poor service was the predominate flavor of the night. Had asked if we could upgrade the fries on the Ahi Tuna (way over seasoned and overcooked) to the Marbella fries, which we received an okay for, but alas did not happen. The ceviche did not blow any minds, edible, and a decent portion size. I'm glad that I had a LivingSocial, because if I had paid full price for what they serve as paella I would be devastated. A few other dishes were ordered, but they slip my mind.\n\nI did not see my server too often, only when she brought the menus, when she saw I didn't get the fries, promotion, and bill time. Sometime during dinner the we were informed of a Facebook promotion they had, which we had an option of getting a small plate, sangria or a desert. The bill however  showed a Facebook promotion line, but had a $0 value, thus being charged for the dessert. The server didn't believe me when I had told them they charged me, but after a few minutes, it was corrected.\n\nThe disconnect from the staff and  non soul reaching food tells me I'll probably skip my next opportunities to come back."
0,"Marquee has a strong reputation for being an awesome club and perhaps that reputation is part of the reason why I was disappointed when I went there for many reasons.\n\nFirst of all, the line up process to get in was ridiculous. We were moved twice into different lines that seemed to have no logic involved in how they were organizing people. There was the supposed guess-list line, which we were in, but the two other lines were moving first. So what's the point of being in the guest list line then? \n\nSecondly, $45 dollars to get in for the guys and that was the discounted guest-list price to get in. Ok its vegas, I get it ... guys have to pay, but for that price I expect service and not all the vices that I will dictate in this review.\n\nThirdly, it was so crowded. In fact, it was so crowded that I couldn't dance anywhere. I could barely navigate through the crowd. I felt like if a fire started inside and pandemonium ensued at least 25% of the people would of died or have been injured. And oddly enough I was so uncomfortable that this thought became cynically funny as I stayed longer and longer at Marquee.\n\nFourthly, and this is for the ladies out there. The club is huge at least three levels. The party that I was with had a number of ladies who's high heels were killing their feet the entire time we were there only to have a bouncer bark at them when they took off their shoes and went barefoot climbing all the stairs. For f@&k sakes, what do you want them to do? It isn't heel friendly, give them a break.\n\nFifthly, no lie, an employee there intentionally pushed aside one lady in our party stating something like \""I work here, get out of the way,\"" as a justification to push her to the floor leaving her potentially to fall down on a floor where there was barely room to walk, let alone dance. Are you crazy? Do you not have a soul? WTF is wrong with you? Oh, I forgot its vegas!\n\nSixthly, to get out of the club once you get in you have go down at least five long flights of stairs. Which isn't a problem that is until you want to get back into the club and you have to walk back up all those stairs. It's terrible for the women and quickly frankly I was sucking wind going back up as well. They need to come up with a better system for re-entry. Maybe there is no other way, but it was kind of crazy.\n\nNot everything is pure evil. The DJs and music were awesome, but if you can't dance what's the point. And the mermaids in the pool on the top floor were happy to take pictures with the patrons and kept doing it even though no one was tipping them. They deserve tips at least they are making sure everyone was enjoying themselves. The club itself is pretty amazing in terms of design and look, but ultimately if so many small things keep you from having fun what's the point."
2,"Food is pretty good.  Prices are pretty high in my opinion.  Staff is really friendly and food comes out quick.  If it wasn't overpriced, I'd be more inclined to give 4 stars."
4,"Look down Prince Arthur street and you'll wonder when did France have time to invade Greece, the hybrid to move to Quebec and America to deprive it of character. Not one Greek name in sight.  \n\nScratch the surface and a different picture emerges. See the fullness of Caverne Greque and contrast it with the emptiness of Cabane Greque just opposite. Says it all.\n\nCaverne managed to keep the Greek flavor, though the character is watered down. Pity, though the other extreme of Greek restaurant with plenty of Hellenic paraphernalia and blaring bouzouki and nisiotiko isn't everyone's idea of a good night.\n\nBYOB, no corkage and a delicious selection for table d'hote and excellently priced a la carte menu. I've had their moussaka, souvlaki and lamb chop table d'hote and can attest to their deliciousness. The Caverne steak really surprised me with its portion: it was very generous and cooked to perfection.\n\nThursdays to Saturdays I really recommend reserving for dinner. Once in a group of 8 they found us a table by pure sheer miracle. \n\nThis is an excellent spot to keep in your books. It is conveniently located, excellently priced and is blessed with very efficient staff."
0,"The ambience was extremely akward, it was so damn quiet, all you hear is the annoying veitnamese pop music. When I leave a resturant I expect to be full and I wasnt even close to that. The menu pictures are extemely decieving. We ordered #5 and it was filled with red onions and vegetables and minimal pieces of meat, basically a mouthful of nothing but the picture clearly depicted a salad filled with beef. All the meat tasted like it was frozen. A lot of reviewers are saying  that the bun bo hue was extremely good, I could not disagree more. It was not even spicy and the broth tasted exactly like the pho broth-pathetic! Portion sizes do not reflect prices either, other vietnamese portions are twice as much for the same price. Our final bill totaled almost 100 bucks and we were all still starving. Also be ready to pay 15% gratuity, so basically an extra 10 bucks. I definitely wont be coming back. The lone star is for the attentive waiters who do a great job."
4,"Last week I had to go back.  And again, and again, and again, and again, and....  I need to post a huge thanks to Ahron Bragg.  I have worked with many VIP Hosts, Managers, Senior Staff, etc. while visiting Las Vegas and Ahron sets himself far above the rest.  I had clients (group of 8) coming out to Las Vegas and Ahron got us a great table for dinner at N9NE Steakhouse and we ended the night at Ghostbar.  \n\nThe staff there (Danica & Danny) are always the BEST in the world but Ahron really made the night, showing my clients an amazing evening!\n\nGhostbar will always be a second home for me when I come to Las Vegas.  Don't worry Ahron, I will be there to pick up my mail soon.  Keep it bundled on your desk, I promise I will be back before the pile gets too big.\n\nThanks again for everything.  \""AB\"" is the MAN!"
0,"Being a rum bar, you would think they know how to make a mojito. Unfortunately, this was the worst one I have ever had. Absolutely terrible, when I sen it back, they made me another one and it was just as bad. Should have just went to the pinkberry across the terminal..."
2,"It was a little hard to find because there wasn't a sign on the front of the building. I ended up driving past it and saw the sign on the back side of the building.\n\nI bought the BBC Omelet (Bacon, Broccoli, & Cheese) which came served with potato slices and two pieces of toast. The small should be sufficient for someone looking for breakfast and the large would probably be best for a filling meal.\n\nThe omelet looked cheap but was very satisfying in flavor. No complaints.\nThe potato slices were a little overcooked but didn't give off a burnt flavor so not too bad imo.\nOne slice of toast was good and the other was a little burnt.\n\nThe restaurant looked like it could hold about 70 people. There were only about 10 people in when I went. It also had a free book exchange (or at least that's what I'm assuming it was), so you can bring in a book that you finished reading and pick up a different one. They're only open from 7am to 3pm.\n\nOverall, I'd say you get what you pay for. If you're looking for an exquisite breakfast, this is not the place to go to, however, if you're looking for something quick and cheap, then you'd regret not trying out this place."
0,"My stay was terrible. I checked into my room and it was a sauna. I requested a different room because the air didn't work, but none were available (they had already upgraded my room because it was overbooked and were too cheap to provide a further upgrade). Luckily I had planned to go out and was not staying in the room at that time as it was uninhabitable. I requested a room change but was refused. She had maintenance fix the air conditioner and it rattled all weekend. \n\nGuests should be informed that the \""soaking\"" tub, is just that and should be advised that the jets do not work and will in fact spray water everywhere. When I informed the front desk at check out her response was to the tone of \""duh its a soaking tub they're not supposed to work\"". The tub stopper didn't work either so best I could do was leave the water running and soak my feet; no I didn't call maintenance. There's nothing worse than having to rearrange your stay to accommodate time for maintenance to fix things that should be working at check-in.\n\nThe price is a bit high for the off-strip location. Might be ok if you get a well-maintained room."
2,"If you have the option for the same price you can probably stay at the Tropicana (3.5* through Priceline)  Otherwise the Excalibur is a pretty standard 3* Hotel.  \n\nFor anyone that uses Priceline be VERY CAREFUL bidding in this area as Hooters is also in the same class and you definitely would be better off at the Excalibur or anywhere else besides Hooters but guess which hotel Priceline will fill first???\n\nAnd even if you can get a good price be prepared for a $12 per day resort fee.........which for this property is WAY overpriced.\n\nThe buffet is also overpriced and is slightly better than the offerings at a Country Buffet/Golden Corral. \n\nOverall, the Excalibur is in a good location and the rooms are relatively well priced."
3,"It was my first time here.  Was recommended by my coworker.  However, I was a little unsure as I've read some bad reviews about this place.\n\nThe first visit was great.  The receptionists were helpful and gave me guidance on how to get my dog licensed.  Everyone seemed happy and talkative.  \n\nDr. Bezak was very nice.  He had a smile on him the entire time I was there.  He was very quick to give me information about anything and everything relating to the dog.  Overall, I had a good first visit and definitely going back.\n\nThe only thing that made it didn't earn a five-star is that my appointment is at 12:15pm.  The entire office have their lunch at 1pm.  So I can tell there was alot of hustle to get me out of their asap.  I don't mind that it was a quick visit, but I would have liked to had time to ask more questions.  If you want adequate time with the doc, consider making your appointment after their lunch."
3,"Lobby 5. Rooms 4.\n\nNo doubt the location, fountain, lobby & chocolate shop are 5 star. I am comparing the rooms to the Palazzo, so they come up a 4. I was expecting more in a standard room (size & amenities) from a 5 star hotel. \n\nSure, I would stay here again (especially at the $99 rate my wife got), but I'd prefer to stay at the Palazzo."
1,"Went here as a youngin and pre-vegas snob. At the time me and my 21 year old gal pal thought Oh cool, STudio 54! Granted, it was when it first opened so it did still have some cache. We went on a fight night so the MGM grand was rockin. At the time we were blinded by too much alcohol, free entry and more free booze so we danced it up like crazy. The DJ's can be ok, the layout isn't the best and the crowd is not the hot crowd. Doubt i'll ever come back as I feel they've been around long enough for vegas standards to be an old has been club and will receive a face lift and a new name soon in attempts to be a hot spot again. When it does, I'll come back to check it out."
4,LOVE this place.  Prices are cheap-- and quality is high.  They load each sandwich with tons of meat and I love their special herb mix.  The staff is really nice and always good about remembering the names of their regulars :)   I find myself eating here several times a week!
1,"The reviews were so high I was expecting a delicious breakfast.  I was disappointed.  What they call \""spuds\"" are mushy oily thick potato chips.  I had the eggs benedict and I swear they made the hollandaise sauce with corn starch. There is plenty to eat, only what there is isn't good. IHOP may get only an average of 3 stars, but at least they know how to make hash browns. Their bacon is nothing to brag about either. Pancake House beats them by a mile. I won't be back."
4,"I just had some maintenance to my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee and they were very helpful and the service was excellent.  I cannot comment on whether it was a competitive price because I did not shop around. However with the convenience of taking my vehicle there, and they providing me transportation back home and to the shop was great.  The customer service was excellent. I'll always pay a few dollars extra for excellent customer service!"
1,"The ponytail guy who runs this place seems totally cool and you get the feeling that this place is totally white friendly. When you order though, you realize it is past white friendly and any self respecting Vietnamese person would be ashamed by this place. \n\nMy nem nuong quon was brought by some cold sore yielding individual who overcharged me by about 50 cents for my rolls, and the \""nice\"" guy who seemed like he owned the restaurant acted like a dick when I ordered."
3,Love this place! Here almost every Monday.  My kids love the food. Love the ultimate burgee and ribs are great.
0,"It's just all around bad.  We've stayed here a few times but it is just progressively getting worse and worse.  The air doesn't work, it's beyond dirty and trying to take a shower is a joke. I will NEVER stay here again."
3,"Kofusion is a fun restaurant.  The service has always been above average, and the $1 sushi is very tasty. I wish the regular dinner menu was a bit more expansive. Also, I wish that they offered the sample sushi platter (that is offered during dollar sushi nights) on their regular menu throughout the week."
1,"This theatre definitely needs a re-haul!  The theatre is older and doesn't have stadium seating or some of the better amenities that the newer theatres are offering such as an expanded menu.  While I prefer going to the theatre located closer to the South Hills Village mall, I will venture out here if the movie I want to see isn't playing there (which is rare).  \n\nThis theatre isn't as crowded, but me thinks it's b/c it's just not as nice.  I went for a movie here this weekend and there was no visual for the first 5 minutes.  We told the staff and they had to rewind the movie - which is no biggie - but the other patrons kept saying that this happens quite often at this theatre.  \n\nI think a little renovation would greatly help this establishment - if you can avoid this theatre and go with one with all the bells and whistles!"
0,"Let's see where do we begin. We were in Phx for a wedding there were about. 20 of us w/ several rooms. We arrived checked in @ 12:30 am after arriving from The airport. We went to our casita I'm a lovely little quiet alcove(this is the 1 star) our electronic key didn't work. After several try's we call for maintenance . He arrived and was also unable to open the door. He went got another key which also didn't work . He let us in then w/ his key & went to get another! @ 1am came back still didn't work . Then we discovered the toilet didn't flush ! Let th know I the morning & they said they had to snake it 3 times! All friends at the other end also had plumbing problems - toilet, no hot water. One arrived in his room w/ 2 TVs in boxes that they had to connect! Others phones weren't connected@ all!  But the crux was- get this ... RATS IN THE RAFTERS OF THE BRIDAL SUITE! the bride and groom had to leave early!!!!!   DONT STAY HERE! It's a has been! Most people golfing were on their 80s!"
2,We liked Crush Lounge better than Christopher's. I guess that means we liked the smaller plates and appetizers better than the entrees. And it's a little pricey if you just kind of like the food. Probably not going to return.
2,"I have been on a mini-bbq quest lately for some reason. I like many others had high hopes for this place and well I have to vote the jury is still out...some good, some bad and overall I left somewhat unsatisfied but hopeful..The fried pickles were uninteresting and tasted average. I had the pulled pork sandwich with mac n' cheese.  The pulled pork had good flavor but not served hot and the mac n' cheese was runny and very average. The potato salad was good. I will go back and try some other things here until I hit the right combo of meat and sides.  My friend had the brisket which was minced for some reason...He did not care for it.  The server was excellent and was very helpful..I hope they keep working on the food a bit because the place has a lot of promise.."
1,"As I told my husband, \""I don't mind hipsters, but I don't want them serving me my food.\"" He really likes OTB (as you can see from his review and 22 check-ins), and I finally tried the restaurant with him this Friday night. I was definitely underwhelmed.\n\nWe started with drinks, and I ordered the Spiced Cider. It was a spiked apple cider that tasted a lot more apple cider than spiked. The only reason that I knew it contained alcohol was because I became very tired half way through the meal. I also had to order the pierogies as they are one of my favorite comfort foods. These were literally the worst pierogies that I have ever had.... I mean, c'mon, if you want to serve frozen pierogies heated in the microwave in Florida, that's fine because no one will know what you're serving anyway. However, this is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you should not microwave your frozen pierogies.\n\nI must admit that my burger was pretty tasty. I ordered The Fixie, which is a burger covered with blackberry preserves and the incredible Wholey's peanut butter. However, the fact that the top bun was too thick and the bottom bun was non-existent just frustrated me. It was extremely difficult to eat, and I even ate a portion of it with a fork.\n\nOur waitress was just as frustrating as those microwaved pierogies. She was relatively attentive in the beginning. However, we finished our meals, and a busboy came and picked up our plates. We literally sat for a good 20 minutes as she just served the back portion of the restaurant, ignoring her three tables in the front. I almost lost it when I saw her hanging out with her coworkers and friends and eating behind the bar. \n\nFinally, the other patrons were annoying. Two or three loud guys were randomly chatting about drunken nonsense, such as getting \""lit up because it's light up night.\"" I mean... it's 5:30pm on a Friday night... are you seriously that drunk already?\n\nOverall, I was unimpressed and do not have a desire to return. Even though the burger was very tasty, the rest of the food and experience was poor."
0,Came here before a show at Nile Theatre as it was located right next door. We ordered some pizza and asked what they had for a beer selection. Our server was not able to articulate anything he directed us to look get up and look at the beers lined up in the bar. The pizza was a bit greasy but overall not bad yet not memorable. Overall the service is awful as we came back after the show for additional beers and the horrible service continued as they seemed displeased to serve us as it was close to closing the kitchen but their bar was still open - we were only getting beers. Would not ever go back.
4,Stayed with a cheese plate.  The malbec is nice.  The Alhambra beer was a hit.  Lamp chops were tasty.  Oxtail was wonderful.  Apple crisp excellent.  Nice evening.
0,"Terrible service. Manager (Omar) was unwilling to listen at all. Our food came out cold twice but the server never came back so we finally just ate the cold food. I'm local and I can tell you there are far better Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. The prices were about double what I've seen and for that I would expect someone to care. We probably saw our server three times and we had to be the annoying people who asked other servers for drinks, forks, etc. I would suggest avoiding this place."
1,i was in a bind and had to find a place close to work to get my nails done before i went to a concert.  luckily when i walked in i was taken care of right away.  the lady who started my nails was really nice and shot the breeze with me for a while.  then i had to wait 10 minutes for someone else to finish the nails.  the guy that came over to finish them had no sense of humor at all.  i would try talking to him or make jokes and he just sat there and didn't smile or anything.  the price was ok.  it cost $32 to get a full set with white tips.  i would recommend this place to anyone but make sure that you don't get the guy!
2,"Great food!  Don't let other reviews sway you with the words \""authentic\"".  It is Americanized Asian food.  I hate it when people try to call things like sweet and sour chicken \""authentic\"".  That being said it is amazingly good at non authentic Asian! \n\nPros - Great taste, portions are just right.\n\nCons - They don't take reservations and the wait can be lengthy at times.  Also, I've been there 5 times now over 3 years and the service is ALWAYS slow.  It's tough to get a refill on anything.  \n\nNote- i'm knocking them down a star due to my recent visit.  They had a magician entertaining a table of girls.  Every time the guy did a trick the girls would literally scream and laugh at the top of their lungs.  It was very distracting.  I know it's vegas and I know it's a Casino but it was excessive and clearly many people thought it distracting as well."
0,"I was going to write a review  a few weeks ago about this place but  after seeing the 2 other reviews i thought it was unnecessary...i then saw the last review ( not sure why i did not see the last review before ) giving a 5 star rating and i almost lost my dinner....are you kidding me ??  i am still laughing about the appetizers - i guess i didn't hit the jackpot like one of the other reviewers -  SO and I got 7 onion rings - costing $6.95 ...keep in mnd this is not in a resort casino and it's not a michelin rating  foo-foo place...and the rings weren't wortha shit !  the crab cakes...are you sure they used crabe...alot of \""filling \"" in these lil buggers and for ...hmmm...i forget the price ...over $10 for sure...a fish place with limited fish offerings...SO who was hankering for some fish wound up ordering a vegetarian plate that had succotash, mushrooms and ...i forget the 3rd item...she ate one mushroom one bite of the succotash and pushed the plate away...and i ate a burger - dry can be - the bacon on top was tasty....i usually give most restaurants 2 tries before i give it a thumbs up or down...nope i ain't wasting the $$$  on thsi shithole again .....my prediction...this place won't last past 2008"
2,"I can always find something I want in this store.  They have great home decor options as well as dishes, glasses, and linens.  Similar prices to Pier One or Bed Bath and Beyone but I think higher quality and more classic styling.  They also have some furniture and lighting options that I think are a little overpriced but still nice.  They have excellent after Christmas sales so check them out on the 26th!"
4,"Went to Midas today to get an oil change that was long overdue for my 2011 Mazda. I'm new to the area so I don't have my own personal mechanic yet, but I found a Groupon deal online for an oil change at Midas. Andrew took my call and made an appointment, he was very sweet over the phone. As I went to my appointment today, I as pleasantly surprised to see that Andrew was working again, he was outrageously polite and really made me feel welcome. \n\nThe Oil change itself was very quick and I was out of there a lot sooner than I expected. I had read some terrible reviews for Midas before, there were quite a few reasons I avoided the Midas in Tempe (due to absolutely awful reviews). But I would have to say, that I was very satisfied with this visit. \n\nI would definitely return to this location."
3,"On a recent trip to Vegas to visit a friend we decided to visit the M, It was free for all ladies 21+ local and non local. They provided towels and plenty of lounge chairs. \nThe pool bar offered plenty of frozen drink choices for about $8-$12. It was early so I had a couple beers for $6 each. They had at least 10-15 waitresses but it was still hard to get someone to take your order so I ended up going to the bar. The do offer a limited menu of burgers, pizza, salads, wings, and a few other items. Typical bar food, but I think they cook it on the other side of the hotel, because my burger was a little cold and my fries were past their prime, I'd recommend eating before you go, but it's nice to have the option if your hungry. \nWe went on a Saturday afternoon, there were a lot of people but we were easily about to find a couple lounge chairs together. The crowd was primarily young families and middle aged couples and groups. Most of the guests were not in great shape, this is not the pool where the young and beautiful go, or the hot spot for singles, at least not on a Saturday afternoon. I think the waitresses were the only ones without stretch marks, belly bulge, saddle bags, saggy boobs, or some odd body hair. It was pretty relaxed. \nOverall I think it's a great option for local folks to hang out at a nice pool and have some drinks."
0,"I have been a Gold Member for 3 years and I've been to a lot of Starbucks locations inside and outside of the country. I have experienced different customer service at all locations and this location is just the worst. This specific location seriously has the worst waiting time ever (drive thru)!!!! I have been to the busiest Starbucks in the world and they do not take this long. Every time I go here they always seem to mess up my drink in some way or another but I don't have time to go back and wait in that 15 minute line. \n\nIf I could I wouldn't give this location any stars. Today I decided to walk in and not do drive thru, since I always have to wait more than 15 minutes. The lady who helped me was very nice and she was quick to ring me up but all of their employees work so slow and take forever to think about what they need to do."
3,"Last night my boyfriend and I went on a double date with some friends at Trader Vic's. I have been dying to try this place ever since it opened at the classy Hotel Valley Ho. I called ahead and made us reservations as I have heard it is a hot spot at night. Once I got there I saw that reservations really aren't necessary during the week. Although Trader Vic's is a very nice restaurant there is an undeniable fun and relaxing vibe to go with the Polynesian theme. Perfect for women who love to wear diamonds with their jeans! The bar is especially interesting with walk out patio that features comfortable seating as well as a zen area where you can sit in the sand. Speaking of the bar the founder of Trader Vic's created the Mai Tai so my boyfriend gave one a whirl and I had a refreshing no Tai Mai Tai: the under twenty one girls best friend. Between us we tried the mahi-mahi, bacon wrapped scallops,and fried rice with shrimp, pork, and chicken. Everything was delicious. An added bonus is the on display chef who you can watch prepare your food. The coffee flavored creme brulee was also an interesting treat. I really enjoyed the ambiance of Trader Vic's and I would definitely keep it in mind for special occasions!"
0,Fox sucks.  Booked our vacation through travelocity so didn't pay too much attention to the car rental company. Our hearts sank when we arrived in the car rental terminal and saw 20 people in line with one worker running the check-in. The line took an hour with no apology or perk to compensate us for our wasted time. Will never use Fox rental car again.
0,"This hotel made my experience in Vegas terrible! A salesperson named HEIDI cancelled my reservation without telling my party and I. The worst part is that after a 6 hour flight we couldn't check in until 4 hours later. The worst customer service ever! Management is rude and tried to say someone named Heidi didn't exist yet Jet Blue was on the phone with her. ALSO, after the 4 hour wait the manager gave us a complimentary dinner but when we went to order we were informed that the manager had no MONEY on her account.\n\nOverall, you get for what you pay for here. Cheap rooms for cheap service. Pay an extra 20 bucks for a better hotel."
1,"Great vibe and atmosphere. I wish they would put as much effort into their food as they did the concept. I expect a little more out of their food, especially their breakfast. It was a bland assortment of items that are done at home or even as well, and cheaper at Denny's.  Too many other good choices in this area to waste on a so-so, over priced spot."
2,"Decent place to see a show.  The acoustics seemed to be ok, the seats - well, after taking a look at them you might prefer standing instead.\n\nThe venue got to be pretty warm - on a spring night, it must have gotten up to about 85-90 inside.  The show we went to wasn't sold out, but it seemed overly crowded down by the stage. \n\nOverall I've seen a few shows here over the years, and I try to save this venue for artists I \""really\"" want to see.  If you're coming in from another city, just be prepared to deal with the chotch factor (i.e. dirty hippies and drunken frat boys) and you'll make out a-ok.\n\nAlso - side tip - there is a parking ramp a few blocks over, and it's only $5.00 to park for a few hours (after business hours).  It was a good deal, not to have to park out on the street."
1,Honestly I am at a bit of a loss as to why this place is rated so highly. I have been there twice and both times have been supremely disappointed. The place is totally dirty (I dare you to look at the floor behind the counter...) and the food is far from fresh  or tasty. I had a tamale the first time and it was dry and oily. The second time I had tacos and the meet was over done and chewy (not is a good way). I know some before have claimed that this place is authentic but I must disagree. Spare your self and look toward Yelp highly rated Mexican grills in Phoenix if you want a fiesta for your taste buds and your wallet.
0,"My stylist  was Raphael.  The haircut was mediocre, at best.  The color coverage was incomplete.  I had quite a bit of gray hair left all around my hairline, especially at the temples and in the middle of my forehead.  The young woman that I spoke with the following day,  mentioned that he KNEW he had missed all of that gray hair.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL FOR SUCH A GROSSLY OVER-PRICED SALON!   Due to his limited availability and my 57 hour work week, scheduling an appointment to correct this was difficult, (over a week out).  Unfortunately, I had to reschedule this appointment in order to work late.  Again, scheduling conflicts became a hinderence to a timely resolution.  However, when I asked if the timing would be an issue, I was ASSURED that there would be NO PROBLEM.  Consequently, I was surprised when the salon called me ONE HOUR before I was to come in for the color correction.  The call was to inform me that I needed to pay 25%, since too much time had passed.  Not even the owner cared whether I was satisfied or would be a returning client.\n\nPOOR CUSTOMER SERVICE--SLOPPY COLOR--BIG $$$ FOR  NOTHING--BUYER BEWARE"
0,"Worst service I've ever had. \nWent there tonight with my two little girls, husband, and parents. We ordered chicken tenders, hot roast beef sandwich, and two fish and chips. \n35 mins later we got our food. \nWe had to ask the servers for more ranch, more water, more lemonade, more napkins... Then our to go box we had to ask for twice. \nThe waitresses were laughing and staring at us when we would ask for something else. Really uncomfortable. They obviously didn't want to do anything other than chat behind the bar. \nAwful service. Food was good, but those two waitresses and the horrible, slow service will mean we won't go back again. \nToo many restaurants to have to settle for this junk. \nNo thanks!"
4,"Nine 05 is awesome.  I've been twice now.  Both times I ordered the same dishes, which says I am not a risk taker, but also that I enjoyed the food so much that it was on my mind until the second visit.  \n\nMy appetizer was pork belly crepes which were sooo tasty.  I am not a fan of dessert crepes, but with the pork, it's a whole different story.  For dinner I had the mussels in a very flavorful red sauce.  I think what I like most about the food is that it's so wonderfully flavored.  And for Phoenix I think this Pan-Asian menu is truly unique.\n\nThe service and hospitality was awesome on both visits.  \n\nSeriously, Go there!"
4,"Kohls is an amazing store to get lost in, if you have time. You can find so much variety for your wardrobe at great prices. The people who work here are friendly and helpful. There clearance is expensive but I feel that maybe more of a marketing scheme to make you feel good about the price. Either way I love this place"
3,"Don is from Chicago. His Partners are Lettuce Entertain You. Chicago boys as well.\n\nThis place makes the food desert of Phoenix bearable to live in. I don't have to order food and get it fedex. \n\nYou can read the other reviews as most are spot on. Here are a few tips.\n\nIf you like ribs that fall off the bone or are really meaty go to Hooters or Famous Daves. These are Ribs like you get at Carsons or Bones in Chicago. In my eyes the best ribs you can get. If you don't like them it is because you don't like Chicago Style. It's you not the ribs.\n\nEverything is now ala carte. The liver. I hate it, my wife loves it. It's not free anymore but it's enough for 3 people. \n\nThe meat comes from Stockyards in Chicago. If you were to order them yourself online you will pay more for just the steak than a whole meal here. They are Prime Steaks. \n\nThe Skirt Steak is one of my favorites. Again that is if you like skirt steak.\n\nThe ribs, I love the ribs, Dons way with sauce on the side. \n\nThe wedge salad. Best blue cheese dressing in the world.  \n\nThe potatoes. Get the Au Gratin. If you like fires get the skinny fries. Instead of steak fries they are fresh cut yet a nice thickness, not skinny like in and out but thinner than Five Guys. I love Five Guys fries by the way. The burgers not so much. The burgers here at D&C are very good though. \n\nThe hot fudge sundae is awesome. Really good ice cream homemade hot fudge is to die for and whipped cream is homemade.  Only problem is you don't get enough fudge or cream and they don't give you nuts anymore because of all the folks with allergies.\n\nIf you get a steak and it's not the skirt get the filet. Get it medium rare with char crust. If you get it any other way it will either be dry cause it is over cooked or flavorless because they don't use butter or bacon on them to help a fairly tasteless cut of expensive meat. If you get filet at D&C it's because you like filet and love the side dishes and dessert. \n\nThe pork chops are not the same as Chicago. They are thin and tough. \n\nIt's expensive so share. One dinner is enough for two people to split. My wife and I order the ribs with Au Gratin and a wedge. The only problem is no leftovers. We love the leftovers. There is room for a small hot fudge sundae though.\n\nGo either early or late and sit in the bar area. If their is a sports team or celebrity you will be treated like chopped liver. Don didn't get all those autographs on the wall for nothing. The athletes get served first."
4,"Breathtaking view of the Vegas strip! A must see. Dim, intimate lounge setting inside."
3,"Even when it is 17 degrees outside, I'll make it out to Dave & Andy's if I want some ice cream. Solid. No I am not talking about the treat but the taste. I tend to always go for the cookies and cream or birthday cake in a waffle cone. I know kind of boring in that I always tend to get the same thing but the ice cream is consistent."
4,"I live almost around the corner from the Kebab Mahal and I loveeeeeeee it.\n\nThere really isn't that much more to say that's not been said before. I'm very, very picky about my doner kebab (that's how we write it in Dutch, shut it) and I love what they do here. They just can't do a thing wrong, if you ask me. \n\nTheir meat is absolutely delicious, their wraps are gorgeous and the dressings are good and proper the way they SHOULD be. It's the one place that makes me feel at home in Edinburgh. Pop in, especially after a late night out, this place will make you very happy indeed."
1,Okay for Fridays after work and Saturday nights are pretty live (drinking).  But catch them under the tent in the sand on an average day and service is a bit slow portions are small and I guess your paying for those skimpy waitress outfits.  I was not impressed after our last family visit there as I was still hungry after I left.  3 fish taco meal was just that 3 dressed fish tacos my kid paid extra for 3 plain fish tacos (add cheese).  Gonna put them on the back burner till I try them again.
0,"My guests and I were seated and we asked for bread, as one couple had just gotten off a plane and they  were starved.  We got it 20 minutes later after asking 3 more times and threatening to leave.\n\nThe Calamari appetizer was the worst ever.  50% of the plate (not exagearting) was old breading, and the calamari was tough and overcooked.\n\nI ordered the Shrimp Risotto, which used to come with shrimp and scallops.   No more scallops.  But of course they raised the price on the dish anyway.   Welcome to new American dining.   Cut the food.  Raise the prices.\n\nBrio presents a nice atmosphere because it was physically well designed.  Problem is, they forgot to hire anyone who can cook or provide nice table service."
0,"Food is always great, however ive been here at least 6 times and each time I was never greated, the waiter ignored me, I saw my food sit under heat lamp while waiter fluttered about not doing his job, no refils, and overall standoffish attitude of the staff will make not recommend this location."
2,"Too many gatherings and birthday parties have been held here by me and my friends. We just love hanging out at this place so much. One of the biggest factors may be due to the location. Located on State Street, this place has shabu-shabu. As a regular myself, I can say that they have quite selection of meats and veggies, but the soup is not consistently good. \nThe service is the same thing: inconsistent. We just hope that we would have a nice waitress so we could have a nice moment. Other time, the waiter/tress could be so rude and forgot to fill in our glass. However, there are some nice waitresses that can do their work well. \nThe lady owner seemed to be overly friendly to a specific race. But one time, my girlfriends and I witnessed a scene when we were having our shabu-shabu. The lady owner was yelling to a bunch of students in her native language. It was quite intense and lasted for almost 15 minutes. One of my girlfriend who speaks the language translated to us. And it was due to some misunderstanding. Too bad, it should not have caused some bad and intense scene that could ruin the atmosphere. \nSince then, I haven't been back. But I know, I will as some of my friends are really crazy about this place and this is a strategic meeting point!"
0,"Gross.  Chaos.  Unhelpful.  Trashy.  Rude staff at every turn.  Hundreds of dollars in billing errors after checkout.  Maybe this place was nice the first week it opened.  But now it feels like staying at a motel in New Jersey during spring break.  Stay anywhere else, literally anywhere else."
4,"One of my favorite restaurants on the planet.  Their frites are life altering (one time they were underdone). It is excellent, charmng, warm and a perfect place to take out of town guests.  (or just a great date place) It is small and it can be a long wait.  I took my stepson from Toronto here, he had the curry mussles and practically drooled on the table. We planned ahead and skipped lunch and usually went for an early dinner.  We recently moved from Pittsburgh, we miss this place!"
4,"I don't usually take taxis very often, but I recently need to take an early morning flight, so I looked up a couple reviews online and decided to give R&H Cab a try.\n\nLet's just keep it simple and say that I will always choose R&H Cab anytime in the future when I need a taxi... in fact, I created a yelp account just to write this review..."
1,"We had brunch there today, and must say we were disappointed.  Service was fairly good, staff was kind and courteous, but we wondered if they were short on kitchen staff.  The food overall was bland.  We had the chili which was the best of what we ordered, the corn bread that came with it however, well, anyone could make something better tasting from a box mix.  The portabella mushroom sandwich was okay,  most of the flavor came from the butter, not sure what the cheese really was...., and the sweet potatoe chips again, we're okay.   Then came dessert. I am a sweet tooth fanatic, and I have very rarely not eaten a dessert, especially if it is chocolate based. The chocolate bread pudding looked chocolate, but had no chocolate, no sweetness, literally, no taste to it .  I kid you not. Not sure how that happens, but they seemed to master it here.  I see this place has really good reviews for dinner, so maybe it is just their Sunday brunch, but will probably not attempt to go back given the many other wonderful resturants in the area."
3,"One word... CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA!\n\nOk...it's one word if you say it like I do. I like to say it fast so I can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating part.\n\nThis place is awesome. I ordered samosas, garlic naan, mixed grill (tandoori oven cooked variety of meats) and chickentikkamasala *giggle*. The mixed grill was good, but the naan and the masala was the highlight. I had to slap the hubby's hands to keep him from eating the whole thing...ok...by 'slap' I mean I may or may not have skewered his fingers with the fork, pinned them to the table and gleefully devoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulance...we're so playful. \n\nDISCLAIMER: *No hubbies were actually harmed or manhandled before, during, or after the consumption of the delicious items procured from I.D.P. The improvised narrative describing the dinner-eating portion is fictional...the tastiness of the items we ordered is factual."
2,Visited this place months ago.  Loved the stuffed shells.  Patio all lit up at night was a romantic touch.
2,"I recently ate some BBQ ribs and coleslaw, only to find out it came from Honey Bear's. I'm not sure if they changed recipes or cooks, but it certainly tasted better than it did in the past. There was more meat on the bone and the sauce wasn't overwhelming."
0,"Once again another update to my service and experience at Chapman Volkswagen.  I have know come to expect the worst from this dealership but want to show my loyalty to a company so i have continued to have my car serviced there.  Well after this last experience that the time of doing anything at Chapman has come to an end.  Once again my check tire light come on so before driving all the way to this dealership i had my tire checked to ensure it was just the air in the tires.  Come to find out i had a screw in my tire at the point that it couldnt be repaired.  Already knowing this i took my car to the dealership to have to tire replaced.  With my past experience of the service department not wanting to help anyone i called ahead to make sure that i was going to be able to get the car in to get a new tire today.  The gentleman who answered the phone had the worst attitude have heard of all time.  He explained that wouldnt be a problem and i drove my car over.  When i pull up in the service department there was one guy just standing there talking so i waited.  All of sudden this younger gentleman wearing a black pants and black hoodie needles to say i had no clue he even worked there walked up and said have you been helped.  I explained to him that i need to have my tires check that i believe that i have a screw in my back right tire.  (this next part is going to be word for word of what happen next).  He said \""you have a giant screw in your tire\"", I said \""OK i will need to get that replaced\"", he said \""it is going to have to be replaced\"", my next response was \""can we get this done today\"", he stood and looked at me and goes \""that shouldnt be a problem\"" and he continued to look at me.  Needless to say talking to a brick wall would have been more productive.  He finally decided to say well i am going to need information from you.  My next response was do you have the tire in stock? As this is the second tire i have purchased form Chapman i figured it wasnt going to be in stock like the first one.  He said it shouldnt be a problem we keep them in stock.  I went the waiting dull and cold waiting room once again.  He returned to tell me that it would take about two hours and this point is when i found out Chapman has already done away with their loaner program.  Nice enough he they offered to comp my enterprise for the \""day\"".  I asked how long it would take and his response was 2 hours.  I took the enterprise rental and went on with my day, he explained that he would call in two hours to let me know the car was done.  Three hours went by and still had no return phone call.  I called in and spoke with the \""customer service manager\"" as I had spoken with her twice before and she was very interested in making sure my problems were fixed from the past experience.  She informed me that she would find out what was going on and would call me back.  Well she never called back but i got a call from the service advisor.  He explained that they didnt have the tire in stock and would have to order it and would have to keep my car over night.  Fast forward to the next day, i received a phone call from the service adivsor at 2pm letting me know the tire came in and they hadnt started replacing the tire yet.  He then called again letting me know i can pick my car up and that the service department closes at 6pm.  When arriving at Chapman to return the enterprise car and pick up my car more headache starts.  I got there before 6pm and the service advisor was not there.  There was only one guy who most interested in his personal conversation that seeing if i needed help.  So i walked back to the sales office and asked if someone could come to service so i can pick up my car.  The gentleman i asked goes \""there is no one there\"".  Once again if i asked to have someone sent to service i am going to assume that there is no one there.  As i am going to walk out he very rudely said \""well i dont work in service\"".  Needless to say he never sent anyone over there, so i walked back to service and stood there an waited.  When no one came i walked up to someone and said do you work here? And said yes and i informed him i needed to pick up my car.  His response \""I didnt know you were waiting everyone just walks up to me\"".  I got my finally got my car back and asked him to speak with enterprise to let them know Chapman will be paying for my rental car so the funds can be released from my credit card.  I went back to the front area to ask to speak with the customer service manger or the general manager and the response that i was given was \""it is after 5 o'clock\"".  \nThe point that needs to be addressed is the quality of service that is being provided by this car dealership.  There is no way me, my family, or anyone that i come in contact will ever purchase a car from the dealership."
1,"Cute decor, ok atmosphere, good location.  Sadly I have to agree with many of the other negative review points for L'avenue.  Crowded, loud, wait staff with enough snotty attitude for all of Montreal and the food was just eh.  \nSeriously, I've had my fair share of eggs Benedict in my life & theirs was nothing special & def not worth the hype & other crap you have to put up with there.  It took our waiter 45 minutes just to take our coffee order, mean while he was hanging out at the counter chatting.  Insulting.  And he refused to speak in English & said there was no English menu.  Or so we were told.  We did try to speak in French, but I find it ridiculous when EVERY other place in Montreal is more than happy to speak in English & French."
3,"Most fast food places have introduced a pricier, fancier burger to their menu. McDonalds has the Angus Burger. Carl's Jr. has the Six Dollar Burger. They cost between $4 and $5 and include some fancy ingredients and maybe a bigger patty to help satisfy the more discriminating fast food connoisseur. But if you spend just $1 more at Five Guys, you'll get so much more burger. Much much more. The basic burger starts at $5.19, but you'll get two meat patties, along with your choice of condiments. You can also get grilled onions and mushrooms at no charge (hey, mushrooms aren't cheap). Definitely a huge step up from fast food, for just $1 more. You can probably find that underneath your seat cushions. If you wanted to keep your bill below $6, you probably won't be able to get their fries, but you can have a side of peanuts for free. Probably better for you, too. Taste-wise, the burger is most similar to Fuddrucker's, except $2-$4 cheaper."
4,"I am visiting from out of state and went here based only on Siri listing it when I asked for a BBQ restaurant. Btw, plenty of parking. When I entered, a pleasant gentleman was wiping tables and he greeted me with a smile and a pleasantness that clearly was natural. He helped me get a take-out menu and suggested several choices. A young man working there was also quite pleasant and I never saw anyone on their cell phone like I have so many times in other restaurants. My food came quickly, was hot, the order was correct, and most importantly, tasted delicious. I am glad I stopped there."
4,amazing gym
1,"This hotel was ok, the Host -Quntin was great., the room took a while to heat up. and the food was good and alot ( dinner). the cheapest thing on the menu was $12.00. The room was wonderful other then the heat part. When it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad. bacon was cooked to hard, the eggs were hard, the fruit was the only thing they could not mess up. that cost me $15.00 (not happy) I went here because my flight got bumped and the next flight was not until the next day. ( not happy). When i went to the bar for dinner they had hockey on and i ask could they change the channel to CNN OR SOMETHING else the guy said no !! all 6 of the tv had to stay on that channel it was a wiring problem."
2,"OMG for YEARS I was soo scared to go on these rides and finally went on 2 of the 3 on my last trip: Insanity and X-Scream.  First of all, we were there in August, so waiting in line in the hot sun was not part of the fun.  Secondly, I didn't know that they would take a picture of us during the ride!\n\nFirst was Insanity (the one that extends over the Stratosphere and spins) and that was a little freaky, but not as scary as I thought it was.  I didn't raise my hands very high, maybe only 5 inches off the handle bar, but it was a big step for me!  \n\nX-Scream (The one that propels you downward & upward over the Stratosphere) was less intense than I thought it was going to be - we were 3rd from the front, so it might have been worse if we were first!  I think I raised my hands higher (just a little) than on Insanity & I totally spocked the camera during the ride, so on our way down I looked straight at the camera with the biggest freakin' smile I could give!  \n\nIt's a great experience, and at least I can finally say that I rode 2 of the rides!  Once is enough, but if someone else pays again - I'd do it!  And in much cooler weather too!"
3,"I actually enjoyed this Pool Party Ditch Fridays! No cover charge, music was good, ambiance was good! Food & Drink are always expensive I mean its Vegas!! But when you get in free, why complain!!"
2,"FIX is a restaurant located right off of the casino at the Bellagio Hotel. Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. Interestingly, FIX can host children under the age of six before 8pm. I found this to be very rewarding and a great option in a sea of restaurants that don't accept children at all. Although the music is a tad loud, it wasn't totally distracting. Concerning food quality, it was A-OK but for steaks I would recommend the dry aging not the wet aging process. A fairly decent wine list, but not a lot in the \""value\"" range.\n\nGood luck!"
3,Overall it has a good selection of traditional American food with some hints of other great styles.  The best part is they are open late.  The only place in town if you want to sit down after 9pm and get good food!  Lots of TVs - great for sports enthusiasts.
2,"My wife and I got a voucher for free gold level tickets and $120 worth of food. What could go wrong? Well, first of all try finding the place. Buried in the heart of Scottsdale Quarter you'd better leave early or do research on finding it in there. (Hint: Look for Tanzy signs. There is no iPic signage on the exterior of the building. It's on a second floor hidden between Tanzy and Salt- the associated restaurant and bar.) The decor was very upscale and arty. \nThe service was slowwww. It took forever to get a glass of water or our drinks. The lights went out before we could finish reading the menu. Our server, while very friendly, seemed overwhelmed trying to explain how everything worked to too many patrons while filling orders.\nThe reclining seats were comfortable but my feet end up next to the head of the poor person ahead of me. The digital movie quality and sound was outstanding. Eating in the dark was challenging. The complimentary popcorn was nice.\nOur food was good. Reasonably priced for upper class Scottsdale ($9-$15). If you like a lot of ice in your mixed drinks you'll love these. Stick to non-ice based drinks. My draft Killians was $6 but  my wife's margarita was $17.\nOverall, I would do this once in a great while for a special occasion. I would recommend trying it for the novelty. It is quite a unique experience."
1,"Too small....too hot...sweaty service people....it may have some good dishes, we just didn't get one in our entire party.  If you must try this place, go after the sun goes down....their cooling system is a huge floor fan that is so noisy you can not hear the music background...and again, if you must go and see for yourself, I suggest dining in the bar area at the tall bistro tables (just two tables in there) you will not feel so crammed in as we did in the very small dining room.  Also, bring your own wine and bring the FREE corking coupon from their web site.  Wish I had read a menu as helpful as mine to you."
2,"I had very high hopes for Notorious...\nMy friend and I went for the first time and decided to share the Capone burger, and at the recommendation of our server, the Notorious Fries.\n\nEveryone working here seemed almost sad. No energy at all, but still friendly...\n\nThe burger came out on two plates, which I love when you split something! It was piled high with egg (yolk still runny, yes!), avocado, onion strings, cheese..it was huge! So glad we decided to share. The burgers also come with a side of slaw, it has almost an Asian type flavor, not my favorite, but OK.\nThe burger was great! The flavors were good and the bun held up to all of the generous toppings.\n\nThe side dishes is where Notorious goes wrong. The Notorious Fries were really bad. I love chickpeas so this seemed right up my alley, but they tasted like a mix of tofu and Styrofoam. Absolutely no flavor at all. The dipping sauce that comes with them is the only saving grace. We ended up sending them back and asking for onion rings instead.\n\nThe Onion Rigs are HUGE! They arrive pipping hot and each has a thick, still crunchy onion inside, but the batter was again very bland. It's almost as if they just forgot to use seasoning on any of the side dishes on our visit.\n\nAll-in-all, great burgers, but don't waste you $$ on the sides...get a cocktail instead. :)"
0,Closed for year's so should be dropped
3,"This is one of those places you want to keep secret so they won't get overwelmed and go downhill.   Or raise prices.   Get the dumplings, ever if you don't like dumplings.  You will like these.  Its good .   Soup or stir fry.   Its yummy yummy.   Its not fancy.   The wait people are polite and keep the drinks filled."
4,"Super-friendly staff. Actually that's the main reason I go here. They can be more expensive than the big-box stores, but it feels more local and personal and I can almost always find exactly what I need without having to walk for miles at Home Depot. Did I mention how helpful they are?"
1,"Stick with Ruth's Chris or Flemmings.  Most of the food was bland. We started with the onion rings and those were far less than expected. The rings are breaded and the breading is bland, but the onions are very sweet. We also had the mozzarella salad and that was quite tasty.  I ordered many sides and all the vegetables were bland. My partner ordered salmon and he said it was OK, but only OK for the price. The service was good but since we were the only diners, I would expect excellent service.  My advice if you go: try the mozzarella salad. It was the best of all the things we tasted.  But for the prices I would definitely go someplace else. I think there was a very good reason we were the only diners."
1,"This place has an AWESOME fashion exhibit on haute couture. I think that most of the exhibits were great but the security was really creepy and borderline stalking. A security person appeared from nowhere when we parked and tailed us on our walk into the museum. Then once we paid the OVERPRICED $10 admission there was basically someone with an earpiece and a jacket following my friend and me around. I don't know if this place doesn't get a lot of visitors or what, but the Louvre was less guarded than this place. Overall, a totally creepy experience."
0,"Small Business BEWARE!  Do not ever conduct business with this organization.  After putting you through a mile of paperwork, you will never get paid.  This is the most unprofessional organization I have ever had to deal with.  They will not return emails, phone call, letters or even have the courtesy to answer the phone.  They will take your product however....and never pay for it."
1,"Sin of sins, cold coffee. How does one get past a coffee drink that should at least arrive warm? I understand the delicate balance between water temperature and as to when the aromatic oils in coffee are released, but both drinks arrived too cold. Pastries were very, very good. Place is very cute, artificially cute, girls love stuff like this. Perfect place to come and pose, it's Boca Park. Seating is uncomfortable and cramped. Service was friendly and attentive. Might be back to give the coffee another chance."
0,"My girlfriends and I were very excited to try DNA for an upscale bachelorette weekend.  After waiting 30 minutes (with no bread on our tables), they finally took our cocktail orders.  30 minutes later came the cocktails and some breadsticks.  The cocktails were delicious, but small pours .. and we not even given the opportunity more until 30 minutes later, when the waitress finally came out to take our dinner menu.  I ordered exactly what she recommended as their best - the tagliatelle and the hake.  The tagliatelle was very good, but anything would be that good drowned in a stick of butter - I'd give it a 4 out of 5 though on taste.  Then, the hake.  I can 100% tell you that this was the worst fish I have ever ever ever had.  It was completely tasteless and they paired it with really subtle vegetables like fennel.  Sooo unbelievably unimpressed.  Dessert was delicious - 5 out of 5.   After all was said and done, our two course meal + dessert took 3.5 hours!!  This restaurant serious needs to buff up its service and fix that hake."
2,"I enjoyed the atmosphere being laid back.  I will have to try it again because I did not care for my chicken.  I was expecting a rub, and it was a sauce.  But, I tried my sisters shrimp and they were good, I will have to ask for light seasoning, they were heavily seasoned."
0,"No service unless asked for, and even then we weren't really 'served', just sort of ignored. Never going there again."
4,What a lovely little gem. Perfect for a quick to go meal on the way to the Grand Canyon. Food delicious and service perfect. Even filled our camelbacks!
1,"For a place with \""Burger\"" in the name, I set my expectations rather high for the burgers.   Boy was I disappointed, I had the \""all good burger\"" what a misnomer.  The two stars are for the wait staff alone - otherwise this joint gets zero stars in my book."
1,"I almost gave this place 1 star, but hey the owners were very nice and cute so I can't do that reason as ratings need to be holistic. My friend was really craving Caribbean food so I did research on yelp and decided on this place because of the high rating. I was SOOO very disappointed. First of all, LACK OF selections, maybe this is an American thing to want to have a couple more options, but to be fair, you can see the menu that is listed under the photos section here, you get like 3 choices. I got the vegetarian platter as well, maybe that's why it's not very good. But I always prefer vegetarian and I've had MUCH MUCH better food elsewhere. I got some kidney beans mixed in with my rice...I feel like I could have cooked myself this with a can of beans dumped into my rice? On top of the kidney beans the veggie platter also comes with string beans...ok they are the best on the my plate. And then it was another selection of veggie that I am not quite sure what it is but this place kinda just reminds me of badly cooked southern food to be honest. But hey, I am going to go back and maybe give it another try on the meat product. As far as veggies goes, not tasty is for sure."
3,"Fox Restaurant Concepts has a dozen restaurants in the valley, and it's no wonder.   They are hard at work, creating inventive ways to serve standard America and Italian fare, and the result is always a culinary adventure.\n\nI dined alone at the bar one night, and had a chance to observe the team work and camraderie that exists between the staff here.  It was a busy time of night, the bartender was juggling the entire bar area by himself, as well as waiting on patrons seated at the cocktail tables.  I noticed the various servers in the dining area helping one another out by helping to serve meals, as well as the manager stepping in to assist the guests and servers.\n\nI had a fantastic margarita, made with pomegranate juice and OJ, a house specialty.  After perusing the menu of classical comfort foods such as the mac and cheese appetzier with andouille sausage, I opted for the brie.  Served at just the right temperature, oozing with cheesy goodness, it came complete with a cherry compote and a heaping of roasted garlic.  Spreading the goods on buttery crostinis, I polished the sizeable appetizer off within minutes. \n\nAlthough my belly was contented with its meal, I was now eager to explore one of their entrees.\n\nEntrees that the bartender suggested, for someone who likes it all and is always indecisive:\n\nRainbow trout with fingerling potatoes, baby artichockes, and charred tomatoes\nCrispy Half Chicken with mascarpone cream corn, and natural jus\nGrilled ribeye with arugula, avocado, tomato, bleu cheese, and an herb vinaigrette\nBBQ Pork tenderloin (his personal fave) with mac and cheese and roasted broccoli\n\nI opted for the rainbow trout, a fish that I love and miss from my days in the northwest.  The entree was delivered so quickly, within 5 minutes, that I had to wonder if it had been waiting for me all along.  The filet was so large that I never got half way through my meal.  It was perfectly seasoned, doused in a wine and garlic sauce, topped wtih spinach, artichokes, and charred tomatoes.  For those that are unfamiliar with this fish, it has softer meat and a \""dirtier\"" taste.  If you are used to the likes of sea bass and halibut, this $19 entree would not be to your liking.\n\nTowards the end of my meal, I spoke briefly with Danielle, the manager.  I had spotted this woman throughout the night, assisting the servers, bartender, and host - along with speaking to guests and showing them to their tables.  I was so impressed with her devoted participation in the restaurant.  And, well, I had to tell her what a great job everyone did that night, especially the kitchen in preparing my magical dishes.  She talked me into their \""Boca Negra\"" cake, the traditional hot molten lava cake, coated in a dreamy caramel sauce and topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  A wonderful end to a delicious night"
4,"Haute Chix Boutique is an amazing place to go & find unique pieces that will flatter most figures and body types. \n\nI happen to live very close to the location in Southern Highlands but I always end up at this location because of work. Of all the times I have went, the staff has always greeted me upon entering and are more than helpful in helping me find something. \n\nSince this IS a boutique, if you like something, don't even think about it, just buy it. They will more than likely run out of your size quickly because these pieces are hand selected and only a few of every size is ordered. I like that. \n\nThe only troublesome thing is that the dressing rooms here are more \""open\"" than the other location and the fabric to cover you isn't thick enough to make me feel shielded from the public eye. - UPDATE: Thank you Selena for your comment on my review and I have to agree that I now feel safe and sound in there :)\n\nCome check them out :)"
0,"So today I went here and eat  the food was ok. :\\ Not exactly cause there was rude service. There was this supervised I was really disappointed cause she try to kick us out. She even made us eat or we will pay I know that the rule and it's ok when she tried reminding us she said it in a rude way. The last time I ate there I stopped eating there for like 5-7 month,  the last time there she did the same thing. This time she did the same thing again but now worst she as if we were the half and half family **** she. She not allow to say that."
2,"This visit was my first to 5 Guys and it was pretty okay. I have heard the In n Out/5 Guys comparisons and I am on team InO but I always welcome a competing burger. Ordering was pretty simple. I had a little bacon cheeseburger with some basic toppings and cajun style fries. It took a little while for our food to come out, which was a sign of them making it fresh as you can see into the kitchen. The fries were okay (I did enjoy the cajun option), the burger was okay - neither blew me away, especially for the price, but I wouldn't object to coming back."
0,"When you want to spend $4.99 on a Lunch Buffet All-You-Can-Eat Pizza, Salad, Breadsticks and Dessert | Served Mon.-Fri. 11am to 2pm.. I guess this is the deal for you."
3,Pretty good food... pretty authentic its expensive but its vegas so win some money and pay... haha.... I'm really chinese so I can tell you that the food is good but its lacking in MSG. Its not as msg filled as most asian places so it tastes good but not like china-town. Most people should like this...
1,"For some reason I didn't read the reviews before I came here. But they're right, 2 stars is even a little generous. \nI had the $19 duck appetizer. Now I love crispy duck and could eat it all day, but the skin was soggy and slimy and there were bones everywhere. Then I had the Singapore seafood noodles. I got 2 shrimp, 2 scallops and 1 piece of white fish. Expected more for $26. \n\nWith so many other options in Vegas, it's safe to say I won't be coming back."
0,"The food at this restaurant was okay and the service was great but their parking lot surveillance needs to be improved.  When we returned to our car in the parking lot about an hour after we entered the restaurant (in day light), we found that a car window was broken and our luggage was stolen.  The sheriff indicated that this was a common occurrence at this site. He was there enough to know that our parking spot was not covered by security equipment.  The manager just shook his head as if to say \""yes\"" when he saw that we had out of state license plates on our rental car."
1,"I am not sure why everyone feels that this is a great place for dinning.  Personally, I feel that I can spent my money in a much better place.  After dinning in this place it just confirms my opinion that buffet does not offer quality food. The buffet does offer a very wide variety of food choices and if that's all you look for in food than this is the place for you.  If you seek quality...you will not find it here.  I know thAt one can have spend $50 at a much better place."
2,Inventive for sure but overrated by far.
2,"Cracker Barrel offers country comfort and down-home comfort food. We got really good service and the food was exactly as ordered and very delicious. This is only the second time my brother had been to a Cracker Barrel and he really enjoyed his burger. One thing I like is that Cracker Barrel, in the recent past, has added healthier options to their menu. I ordered an Apple BBQ chicken breast. Perfection. I also like that they let you pick and choose what sides you want with your meal. You can make it healthy or you can make it not-so-healthy. Their hash brown casserole is to die for, but it's something I stay away from. \nBig demerits: They were out of sweet potatoes and out of mixed vegetables. Both of my dining partners had wanted those options, so they were a bit disappointed.\nOne plus about our stop here, we were there for a meeting, so stayed past dinner for a spell. The server continued to offer us coffee and water while we visited. Very, very nice."
4,"Visiting Vegas from Bay Area. Giants playoffs! Where we gonna watch them? Walked into El Segundo Sol and they treated us so good. I had to leave for 20 minutes (the rest of the party stayed) and they insisted they would make  my Chile Rellano over when I returned! Great customer service and the food- tacos,huitlacoche quesadillas (wow), salsas, incredible tamale, even the mexican pizza was great.\nso, the next day, we return to watch the Giants Playoffs. Well, 6 Hours, 18 innings later- the staff, the manager, the food--all still fresh, friendly, awesome! and Jalapeno cilantro margarita!\nWhenever we return to Vegas, we will be eating there!\nThank you , El Segundo for making these Giants Fans Happy!!"
1,"First, it's way too crowded and expensive. Second, the women are too \""surgically enhanced\"" for my tastes, and they just don't do a lot for the massive amounts of cash you end up giving them. \n\nAdmittedly, the only time I went here I was drunk at my own bachelor party, and I didn't have to pay for anything, but still ... the softcore porn on Skinemax back in the hotel room is a better deal."
3,"Only got take out from here. I will have to try dining in. The food was delicious and ready fast. We ordered lemon chicken, beef fried rice, and egg rolls. All of it was delicious and reasonably priced. Portions were big too so leftovers for lunch!"
4,"The food is delicious (comfort food,) the owners and their son are tremendously kind, and the restaurant is clean and comfortable.  \n\nGo to Beaver Choice to relax; this isn't Olive Garden folks, they're not looking to get you in and out in under an hour.  So if you're looking for fast food, go to Wendy's."
2,"I grabbed breakfast here with my mom before we hit the road back to LA. I had the eggs benedict, which I probably haven't eaten in 10 years. The eggs were so perfectly poached that it pained me to break them, but the hollandaise was kind of bland. I can't remember what hollandaise tastes like, but I can't imagine that butter + egg yolks would equal bland. My mom had corned beef hash which looked (and tasted) very similar to the canned kind. \n\nThe breakfast here was just okay. I don't know why there is always a big line because it's not even cheap. Next time I will just grab a starbucks and hit the blackjack tables."
0,Came in for dim sum. Food looked like it was left out over night. Some food were room temperature. We were starving so ate it anyways.  We had diarrhea that night and following morning. Never again!
4,"This was the best find ever for a few reasons! My background is in luxury hotels and spas, so I've been to and had my share of spa treatments and facilities. At the end of the day there is ONE reason why people go back to the same aesthetician or massage therapist over and over, its SERVICE! Dale is, yes, a male and for those of you with the fear of \""I'm too afraid to have a male wax down there\"", you'd be making a huge mistake. Not all aestheticians are created equal unfortunately. In the past with other providers there have been challenges with pain and scarring when getting waxed. When I leave the studio, I have the best education on after care, products to use, and pain free. Dale's studio offers a wide variety of services, he just so happens to be my go-to-guy for Brazilians. Extremely polished, professional, educated and has a great sense of humor.\n\nDale is someone who is passionate and successful in anything he does.  Recently retired as a pilot, he makes sure his clients have the best of the best, at an affordable price.  You're in great hands with Dale and comes highly recommended!"
2,"The thing I like best about The Gym is the name. If you need an excuse to go have a drink or what ever and your S.O. asks where you are going, now you can say, \""The Gym.\"" That being said, they do have a full bar and a cool drink menu, which I frequent by trying new drinks when ever I eat there. The food is decent bar food, wings and all the trimmings. I have heard its the best place in QC to get your groove on, but I have yet to catch that. If you live out in BFEQC, you should check it out for sure!"
3,"Hidden but not enough because the line was long! Luckily the line went fast and the staff was nice and pleasant. I had a slice of sausage and ricotta. Mmmmmm. Thin crust, fresh toppings. So good!!! I forgot to order a cannoli so I will definately be back!"
0,"Its amazing how people are led to believe that this place serves delicious Mexican food. I would like to know WHAT they are ordering. Been there once and never went back again thanks to their awful long lingering wait staff that took forever to bring us drinks and food along with the low quality of the food. The chicken enchiladas I ordered were disgusting to say the least, chicken was black and gross, and they were covered in a mountain of what seemmed to be green ooze that was trying to be salsa verde with nacho cheese. Never been back."
4,"When I lived in Henderson for a year, this was the only place I went to get my eyebrows threaded. I went every 2 weeks and Ana was always there to do a great job. She works fast and that's how I like it. Most other threading places would work slow and I learned that threading slowly irritated my skin and I ended up bleeding and swollen but when Ana did it, she threaded so fast that I couldn't even feel the pain from the constant pulling. She even took the time to shape my eyebrows and make sure that it was clean. Since I've moved to the OC I've been looking for other threading shops that could do it as well as Ana but had no luck whatsoever. Hopefully they will open one up here in the OC."
1,"I wanted 10 once wheat grass , they charge d me 5 times 2 onces price instead of 8 extra one once. Bad"
1,"The lunch experience was extremely lacking for their overpriced and mediocre food along with poor service.  The first thing I heard when I went to the desk to ask to be seated was \""You will have to take off your hat to walk through the restaurant\"".  This created an expectation in me that I would be getting comparable food to the snootiness right off the bat.  The hamburgers we purchased for over $20 could be had at a million better places all over Las Vegas for half the cost.  They gave us some hard French bread rolls that almost broke my teeth before the meal.  The service was poor as well.  Avoid this tourist trap and listen to a local scorned."
2,It's a nice small zoo. The kids enjoyed feeding the manta rays. 99% of the concession stands were closed and it was really hot out
1,"I don't know why this receives such high marks.  The fro-yo was icy, kinda clumpy.  Not a nice smooth consistency and a reminded me more of the frozen ice that spews from a soft serve machine at a Chinese buffet.\n\nI wasn't feeling any of the flavors, so just settled for \""country vanilla\"" and \""chocolate malt\"".  Besides, there were a couple workers there mass filling some cups for a some catered order and totally ignored us while blocking out several machines.  After throwing down $11 for a couple meager cups, I sat down, took a scoop and was instantly sad, partially disgusted.  Terribly overwhelming artificial flavor.  Well at least my usual cereal toppings were consistent.  Cute decor though.  Hunt out a local Yogurtland instead.  Fro-yo girl would be displeased."
3,"Travelling on business, stopped in for an early dinner at the bar. Very attentive staff.  $5 house wines for happy hour...awesome!  I had the double cheeseburger which was amazing!  If you go here, you have to try it.  Can't wait to come back!"
2,"Definitely not what I was expecting for a first visit, but its definitely a decent South End bar.  Plenty to do, plenty of places to chill, and TONS of booze/beer behind the bar. I really dig the giant tables with old church pews near where they put the bands. \n\nReally dig that they have darts and some other video games, too. \n\nThe only part that freaks me out, like many other spots in town, is the parking situation. Just a little scary and not sure \""where\"" to leave the car. Ya know?\n\nIt's a great spot and the beer is cold. I'll definitely come back."
0,Sat there for 20 minutes and a server never came. I went to the host twice to get us a server but nothing happened. I will never go back.
0,"This Safeway is so so so slow!!\n\nThey only ever have 1-2 checkers no matter when I go in. On top of that their credit card machine has frozen up for extended periods of time and they still won't open a new check stand.\n\nThey do have 50% off specials on things that are going bad and that is the only reason why I shop there.\n\nBut several times the cashiers have forgotten to take this discount off, when I bring this too their attention they make you get back in the ridiculously long line instead of handling it right then and there. So then my 20 minute quick run into the store is now 45 minutes. It's annoying."
4,"The staff is super friendly every time I'm in this store. I think I've been there almost every month since there's always something there that I'd love to have and it's right down the street.  Whether it's random cooks tools like a 4\"" wide vegetable peeler (highly recommended), a Microplane grater or splurging on a new Shun knife, Williams-Sonoma always seems to have what I want with people there who know what they're talking about."
1,"My first thoughts on LVAC is \""THIS PLACE IS HUGE!\"" However, size isn't everything! I came in here with a small group of friends to try it out and did their 1 day free pass. Our tour started out nice and welcoming, but then turned sour quickly. The guy at the front desk gave us a nice in depth tour explaining nearly everything you would need to know about the gym; however, once we finished the tour, I felt like I was being attacked like a little 4 year old in a pedophile's van. We were brought into a small office where the employee was pressuring us into buying a pass before we had even stretched or worked out! When we had decided to leave, the employee also made a big deal about us not deciding to buy a membership. Clearly, all they care about is making money.\n\nAnyways, more about the gym... They have a room where people lift weights and simply put, that room smells like a donkeys butthole. I normally enjoy free weights, but I think I was smacked by a wall of testosterone when I walked in, so I just turned and went upstairs instead. Most the gym equipment is spaced VERY tightly so if you're claustrophobic or don't enjoy crowded areas, this is not the place for you. I'd have to say the only perk to this place is that the gym equipment is nice and very well constructed (from a civil engineer's standpoint). \n\nSimply put, if you're on the fence about coming here or don't enjoy the smell of butthole, I would say avoid it, but if you have a good amount of friends who already come here and you can stand the stench then join at your own risk."
2,Very average steak place.  My filet was tough.  Maybe the chef had a late night and got up early so he didn't pay attention while cooking my steak at 9:30pm.\n\nI won't be coming back.  There are better places to eat in Vegas for this price.
0,"The first time I went we had a big group and plenty of conversation so we didn't really mind the slow service.  The flat breads were all great as were the tacos.  The pulled pork sliders were a little weak, but the food was very good overall.  The second time the horrible service reared its ugly head.  My girlfriend and I sat down and just under 20 minutes went by and no waiter came to see us.  The one guy I saw was absurdly overworked.  The poor kid seemed to have 10 tables and was bussing his own tables as well.  When we left the manager seemed genuinely apologetic and tried to offer us an appetizer.  I just can't give my business to a place like this when there are plenty of restaurants in the city that are hustling to earn our business.  I like the food, but the atrociously slow service is too much to bear."
4,"I was a bit skeptical that P and B would be able to wash, deep condition, and blow dry my hair in an hour (it takes me two hours to blow dry my thick, long, curly hair!) Shannon did my hair: she was all business. Not much small talk, but thays ok because I enjoy having the quiet time and often find small talk forced. I have to admit I doubted her, but section by section, she gave me a gorgeous blow out, with some curl at the ends (as I dont like it pin straight). Not only that, she finished with it all in an hour. I cant say enough how many stylists leave my hair frizzy and still wet, so suffice it to say that I was blown away, and will recommend Shannon to all my thick/curly-haired friends!"
1,"OK I love sandwiches. I was the kid who had the same Turkey Sandwich everyday for lunch growing up by choice because I love sandwiches. Now with that being said I live near Old Town which is lacking a good sandwich spot in my opinion. So when my girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place thanks to Yelp! we were excited. \n\nFirst of the place looks really cool. It looks like sharp and somewhere you would want to eat. It was a Sunday afternoon and we walked in around 2pm, the place was relatively empty. After we looked through the cold case and the menu we walked up to the counter and waited.....and waited....and waited. There were 5 employees standing right in front of us really enjoying themselves until one finally realized we had been waiting to order. We ordered panini style turkey sandwiches paid and sat at the counter top bar. \n\nThe food also took a while to come out. As we sat there we just watched the employees play on their phones, make fun of each other, hangout in the back and overall very unprofessional. When our $9 sandwiches finally arrived they were only OK. Nothing we couldn't have made at home with a $10 panini press from target some deli meat and bread. \n\nIt gets two stars because of the restaurant decor and OK food. The staff kills this place they are loud, unkept and unprofessional. I'll spend a few more dollars and go to many of the other great restaurants in Kierland."
0,Don't come this restaurant.Supper bad service!!!! Food is also not good!!!! Will not be here again! !! The waiter let us out when we were sitting in the table and waiting for our friends. We have ordered food and eating. But they still let us out in order to place order customers to sit in. I have not been a restaurant like this bad bad service. Not recommend to come this place if you have a more than 5 people.
4,"Captain Bill's, a seafood restaurant set just outside of \""downtown\"" Madison, WI was an excellent discovery.  The inside reminds you of an old ship with wood paneled walls, fishing nets, buoys and other nautical paraphernalia.  One room features a large central fireplace that creates cozy setting on freezing Wisconsin nights, and there is also a seasonal outdoor patio that provides pretty views of Lake Mendota.\r\n\r\nThe food is excellent, and reasonably priced for the amount and quality that you're given.  I've tried several of their entrees (king crab legs, the steak, shrimp sampler etc) and have never been disappointed.  For those not interested in seafood they also offer a variety of chicken and pasta dishes.\r\n\r\nIf you go you MUST get the clam chowder, crab cakes and coconut shrimp.  They're award-winning and featured on the Food Network for a reason!\r\n\r\nGo to Captain Bill's.  It's excellent."
0,staff is friendly enough..drs are quick and dont really listen or ask any questions... ive changed drs since my last visit and am very happy. i had an appt that i had rescheduled here and they keep sending and will not stop sending a letter asking me to pay for a missed visit when i called to cancel a week before. found a way better dr...little better to drive but at least i feel like im getting the customer service i deserve...
4,The wait staff is ever so endearing.  I was dining here alone and my waiter went out of his way to carry on a  conversation with me.  I am conversationally akward but I appreciated the gesture none the less.
1,"First off, the range itself is great.  It's a good, safe facility to shoot off some rounds and have fun.  My problem is with the staff.  They're not friendly or engaging and if you talk to them they act as if you're bothering them.  The general feeling there seems to be that they're doing us a huge favor by allowing us to enter the store and shoot!  I have news for you guys, I'm surrounded by millions of square miles of empty desert!  I don't need to go there to shoot my guns off...this is Arizona, after all.  It may be a gun store, but it seems to me that they are still in the sales business...and sucking at it.  The first time I went there was to look for a small pistol for concealed carry and after asking about several different brands/models(none of which they had in stock) the employee just walked away like he was tired of talking about guns!  The second time I was there was to shoot at the range and when I approached the desk nobody was there, however two employees were chatting it up 10 feet away and completely aware I was just standing there.  It's cool, I figured out what to do and what to fill out on my own.  It wasn't until a line started to accumulate behind me that one of the guys came over.  No \""Hi, how are ya?\"" no \""Welcome to Shooter's World.\""  not even \""Are you here to shoot at the range?\""  Just \""Um, if you need targets they're over there.\""  I have a sales staff as well and none of this would fly in my company to say the very least.  Just so you guys know, you sell gun rentals, range time, and products you don't manufacture yourselves...THE ONLY REAL PRODUCT YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE IS CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Nice place.  Staff needs serious work. F-"
1,Great margaritas but food was just ok
2,"ehh, not good and not bad. This place is ok and if you're craving chinese and don't wanna travel to far, this place is fine. The price is not very expensive and food comes out quick. The atmosphere is cool as well. The food quality was not bad but not something to go around raving about. Overall, i would choose a different place to eat, but this isn't a bad choice"
2,"The food was good, and our server and her trainee were very nice and helpful.  But the food was just good (which deserved 4 stars) but the manager seemed more interested in talking to the hostess than smiling at customers or asking them how they're doing as he walked by.  It's a chain, what should I expect?"
4,"I'll admit that I don't entirely remember the whole night at XS, but if, no WHEN, I go back to Vegas, I will definitely be hitting XS up again. It's probably my favorite club that I've been to in Las Vegas.\n\nMy girl friend and I paid a little extra and skipped a rather long line since it was on the night of a MGM fight, and the place was packed. As I walked in, I remember that the decorum was amazing. I'd love to go back and photograph it since there was (thankfully) no photographic evidence of our sisterly debauchery that particular night.\n\nWhile the drinks are pricey, the decor, the vibe, and the crowd make up for it all - even the cover fee. Most people are in their early 20's to 30's and it's a rather classy place. The outdoor area by the pool was chilly in mid-December, but toss back a large shot (or 6) of Grey Goose and you're all set! \n\nXS embodies all that Vegas should be. And more."
2,"Came here with a party of eight on a Sunday night.  Tried many different things - with generally ho - hum results. \n\n Seared tuna was cooked through and had to be taken back.  Cute restaurant guy called it \""a tragedy\"", which was cute.  He comped the recooked plate, which was nice.  Carpaccio pizza was good but the taste of the tiny pieces of beef was lost in the arrugula and blue cheese and crust.  Steamed veggies were pathetically dry, plain and boring. Meatloaf was yummy and satisfying.  Chicken was fine - not that special.  It was chicken.\n\nCalamari had a major scary fishy taste and was basically inedible.\n\nsushi was good.  \n\nService pretty much sucked.  \n\nBread basket was steller.  One could be very happy with just a bowl of soup and a basket of bread.  Oh - and the meatloaf.   \n\n\nStaff comped a  dessert of a GIANT cloud of peppermint cotton candy for the table.  It was kind of mystifying, but fun in its own way."
1,"Why is it that no two Menards stores are arranged or laid out in the same manner? I mean, seriously - I don't get it. \n\nPerhaps it has something to do with the relative age of each store? If that's the case, this particular location must have been \""Plan C\"" for \""chaotic.\""\n\nI know my way around the west side Menards like the back of my hand. It never takes me more than a few minutes to run in, grab what I need and get back home.\n\nThis store; holy cats. It's like someone made a list of all of the departments, threw them into a big top hat, shook the hat vigorously, and then dumped it onto a floor plan.\n\nExamples: you've just purchased a new faucet and would like to replace the faucet lines and fittings. One would reason to think these components would be located within a few aisles of one another... HA! Gotchya! They're nowhere near one another!\n\nNeed a mirror to go with that new faucet? You'll be making a trip to the PAINT department for that, which seems entirely logical to me (insert eye roll).\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea.\n\nAt least the checkout folks are friendly. The same can't really be said for the few department staff I've dealt with; on a recent visit, two department guys were standing in the middle of an aisle talking about how \""f-ing dumb\"" a previous customer was. Nice.\n\nIn general, I'm a fan of Menards - especially the west side store. This one? Not so much."
1,"I'd like to say that the food was delicious except that our party of ten came to happy hour based on their website featuring a happy hour food menu. But when we got there after ordering drinks we were told that there was no happy hour menu, and that they were very sorry but the website is outdated.  The manager mentioned that they would be updating the website, after 2 years, to correct that they had happy hour specials... Meanwhile, our entire (now very hungry) party had to  to finish our drinks and find  a different restaurant .   Really,  the proper,  or classy move by the manager would have been to offer us the advertised happy hour menu and prices to make up for the mistake. So anyway I cannot comment on the food, but the one beer that I had was quite nice. So, there's that."
3,"I've only ever been to Lunchbox on sunny Sunday afternoons, when my husband is all, \""Hey, Grinderman has a new album out - let's go to Lunchbox.\""  When we get there, husband buries himself in the used section and does his whole flip-through-every-single CD in search of untapped gems (he generally comes away with two or three), and I surf along the top, occasionally dipping beneath the surface to come up with old mid-nineties rock albums I never bought but always wished I had.  \n\nLunchbox is a small but truly great place to buy music, even if you don't get past the first shelf (which is stocked with lots of excellent new releases).\n\nAlso, it's next door to the Dairy Queen, which is a must on a sunny Sunday afternoon.\n\nLunchbox + DQ beat the Sunday afternoon blues every time."
3,"This place seems very laid back and offers diamond ice (I haven't seen many other places that offer it here). My cousin searched for the nearest coffee place when we were out running errands and found the Street. I would not recommend coming here for coffee (very limited menu), but there are plenty of options for boba, smoothies, and diamond ice."
1,"This is a local place I been wanting to try for a while now. Phoned in an order of jerk chicken and curry goat since that's what most people have given good reviews. The service was nice and friendly. When arriving, the place was quaint, clean and nicely themed for the cuisine. \n\nThe goat curry had really good flavor. However, it seemed like every other bite I chewed into a bone, and had to pick it out of my mouth. Not very pleasant. The jerk chicken was very dry and bland. The load of rice and side veggies were subpar fillers for a disappointing meal. I was really looking forward to finding a new local ethnic place. I am very surprised with the 4 and 5 star reviews."
1,Food was cold/average. Service was okay. The owner himself was nice. Would not go back.
1,"Food was exceptionally good - that's the reason for 2 stars instead of 1 star.\n\nHowever.  Big however here folks...\n\nJamie, the manager, who was our waiter, was off the charts ridiculous. He was dropping f-bombs and swearing like a sailor assuming we would be warm to that?!?!?  \n\nHe made us feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, I would go as far to say that given the dilation of his pupils - he was either on coke or crank. \n\nThe last straw was when he insulted my wife and I as he was giving us our check. Wtf ?!?!\n\nWon't be back."
4,"This rating is based on a dinner visit.\n\nAtmosphere - 4.5:  Entry into the restaurant features a stroll down the staircase around the glass wine tower, which is something that sets Aureole apart from the crowd.  There are two seating choices, the main dining room and the Swan Court.  We chose the Swan Court which was more private, quiet, and romantic.  The room overlooks a pond that has curious swans swimming about that seemed interested in checking us out.  The only downside to the Swan Court is that there is no view of the Wine Angels flying about in the wine tower to retrieve your special bottle of Vino.\n \nMenu - 4:  You have two options for the menu: 1. A fixed \""Parallel\"" menu with two selections for each course.  The Parallel menu is a tasting menu where the selections aren't choices, but both course items are served together, in parallel.  This option can only be selected if the entire table is willing to go with this choice.  2. Select from a traditional style menu with a variety of appetizers, main courses, and sides.  We went with the fixed menu because we loved being able to sample a wide variety of dishes. Either option offered diverse selections.\n\nService - 5:  The is a Four Diamond restaurant so our expectations were fairly high, but Aureole did not disappoint.  Service was fantastic from the moment we entered right up until we left.  My wife has some food allergies and the staff did a phenomenal job accommodating her and modifying some of the dish preparations.\n  \nFood - 5:  Outstanding!  Everything was prepared to perfection.  The dishes were creative both from a culinary and visual perspective.\n\nWine List - 5:  In a word, WOW!  The wine list is on a tablet computer that you can search, sort,  and filter on various criteria (region, vintage, type etc.) to find what suits you.  It's a good thing too, because they have an unbelievable selection.  It's obvious why they have won the Wine Spectator Grand Award every year since 1999.  The sommelier knew the collection very well and and helped us pick out some amazing bottles.  I was blown away.\n \nOverall - 5"
4,Hmmm - for 5 stars - a place needs to a) have great drinks b) have great service...and for extra credit - c) also provide great ambience (yes - that is the correct spelling - sc*** you yelp spell checker). \n\n Parasol Up - Parasol Down delivers on a) b) and c). The drinks are OUTSTANDING. I tried the muddled cucumber (cucumber topped with ginger beer (non alcoholic) and the grapefruit strawberry collins. Both were amazing. \n\nThe view overlooks a giant indoor pool with a waterfall inside the WYNN. Could not ask for a better view. Will definitely go back.
1,"\""Sizzling rice soup is the only thing that sizzles\""\n\nWent here for lunch with my wife and mother-in-law because we were in the mood for Chinese food.  Although it was our first time, it may be our last time as well.  I ordered the Kung Pao chicken which as filled with thick sauce which did blend the chicken and vegetable together, but more like made everything taste the same.  My wife had the eggplant chicken which I think tasted the same as the Kung Pao chicken as well.  Should have called it Kung Pao eggplant chicken.  The dinning room is similar to that of a lodge converted to restaurant.  I did order the sizzling rice soup which was good, but there wasn't enough soup as the rice soaked it all up.  Price was a little high for portion sizes I thought.  Although the owner was very nice and cordial that is the reason I gave this 2 stars.  There is very little authenticity to the restaurant as the ROA is a dismal 10%, ratio of authenticity is #of ethnic patrons/#total patrons."
0,Awful. The staff here is a joke. Made a reservation a week in advance for a group of 10 people for a bachelor party. They gave away our table as we were waiting and were forced to wait another hour as other groups arrived and were seated promptly. Definitely ruined the one group dinner event we had planned and did a good job of making us feel as if our business did not matter.
0,"9 of us met for dinner. The food was good but nothing special. When we got our bills we each were charged a $10 \""service fee\"". Waiter was not clear in explaining the fee. Some of us tipped on top of it due to the confusion. When one of the party called later to get an explanation of the fee, she was given 3 different stories. Tom agreed to call back with explanation but he never called back. Poor service!  9 of us won't be back because of this."
3,"Yeah, this one's not in the best neighborhood, but I don't shop here at night. It doesn't matter that when I come here during the day, there are lots of weirdos shopping here- yup, some crazies. Inside it's more modern than other Vons; popular store, busy. There is a US Bank inside- the primary reason for my visits, but not recently. My mom banked with the same bank too, so double that- plus the hours were better than the normal banking hours. If there's a line, just look at the books nearby. Starbucks inside. The liquor is locked up in front. Seasonal items in front as well. Good bakery department. Excellent gift card section. Entertainment coupon participant- four of them, time specific. As with all Vons, typically higher prices for the groceries compared to Smith's. Go for the sales or if you're in the area. And definitely get the card if you don't already have it, since the prices are better using it."
0,"Wish I could say anything good about this place, but alas, it fell short. Was looking for small place charm, but ended with large disappointment."
2,"This place is awesome., The Gyoza are delicious and the Shoyu Ramen was as good as noodle soup gets."
3,"Lon's is a classic, old time Scottsdale with a great bar, and atmosphere. they really put effort into New Years Eve. Our group of 4 -20 something's and 2 parents had good food, good service and a good wine program. Always a stop whenever we come to Scottsdale."
1,"Driving in the area and hungry, I decided to give this place a try for lunch.  I looked at the menu on the wall and decided to order:\n\nCarne Asada Burrito, $5.59\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=MfPA1uFY07lEvACv-o5CfQ#MfPA1uFY07lEvACv-o5CfQ\n\nBeans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $2.98\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=d-ovX_PN6CDCe7CUqOjLkg#d-ovX_PN6CDCe7CUqOjLkg\n\nThe service here was brutally slow.  The lady working the cash register could not multitask....it was agonizing.\n\nWhile waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up on Salsa.  Since I like spicy Salsa, I went for what appeared to be the spiciest one...turned out to be watered down, mild Gringo Juice...*bleh*.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw#VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw\n\nThe food came out after a long wait.  Customers were confused because the cashier was calling out the wrong orders and people were returning saying it wasn't what they ordered.  By this time, there were 8 or 9 of us waiting...it was a hot mess in there.\n\nI went for the Carne Asada Burrito first.  I took one bite and didn't like it...it was way too salty.  The Burrito was all Meat & a little Guac/Salsa combo...no Rice or Beans...that's a common recipe in some of these Taco shops.  Since there wasn't any other ingredients to soften the salty flavor, it was just bad.\n\nNext, I went for the Beans/Rice/Cheese (BRC) Burrito.  I took one bite and that one was bland.  I don't know if my taste buds were shot from the salty Carne Asada Burrito, but it wasn't good either.\n\nThe Salsa wasn't *meh* too and couldn't save it for me.  Towards the end of my meal, I noticed a guy speaking in Spanish to the cashier lady...she goes to the back and comes out with a couple of cups of \""spicier\"" Salsa that was hidden in the back...dammit!  Secret menu I guess....\n\nThere are too many other good places in town, I won't be back here.\n\nReturn Factor - 0%"
4,"Luscious, buttery lobster that tasted like it had been pulled moments ago from the Atlantic.  Crispy salty brussels sprouts, cauliflower that was crunchy on the outside and melty on the inside, and watercress salad so fresh and crisp and light and zesty that I want to travel back to Vegas just to eat more.  Really an excellent dining experience, and worth every sheckel."
0,"Ummmmm....yuck.  Just \""yuck\"".\n\nI mean, seriously?  I give it one star because the waitress was nice and we got good service.\n\nWe were here last week.  Wife got her birthday \""grand slam\"".  OMG...I don't know what they did but it was disgusting.  The pancakes tasted heavy and fat and, well, just \""yucky\"".  They should have been \""light and fluffy\"", as most breakfast places will make them.  Eggs weren't a lot better.  I wouldn't be surprised if eating that shaved a year or two off her life.  It was free for her birthday, and I still think we got ripped off on that one!\n\nI had a burger and fries.  Well...they were better than McDonald's.  Can't say they were bad.  But definitely nothing special.  You could make a better one in your own kitchen in about 10 minutes for a fraction of the cost.  If you want a decent burger try Fuddruckers or Red Robin or someplace like that.  For the price, Denny's burger was definitely not worth it.\n\nI don't care if it's free on your birthday, it's not worth it.  Don't come here."
0,"I was a little disappointed, the place is very old and the service was not great came in for dinner, way over priced for the portions and rice and naan not included! My suggestion is you read all reviews before going."
4,Always support your local USO even if you're not active duty or retired!  God Bless America!
0,"I wanted to ensure my hair was done right, so I bit the bullet and paid the high prices at Rolf's.  The last time I had my hair colored, I did NOT love it, but it was just OK.  This time, I've now spent a total of 6 hrs for the initial color and then the color correction.  My hair is bright orange.  I am absolutely mortified.  I was so upset and knew there was nothing more than could be done without my hair falling out of my head from all the chemicals, so I just said it was fine, paid the $300 bill, and left.  My friends said I shouldn't have paid 20 cents for what I got.  I can assure you I will never make this mistake again, will NEVER return to Rolf's, and I sure hope you don't either."
3,"This is a decent used game store and they have a variety of old school games to look through. They do need to limit the number of same used games per console though as looking through the NES section there were 10 Top Gun games, and a billion SMB variations. It fattens the shelves to look like there were more games there than there really are.\n\nThe prices are a bit high in some games, but low in others. One problem I noticed is game cartridge shape didn't really affect price. I was staring at 2 of the same game and one was really beat up with the label in bad shape and the other looked okay, yet they were the same price. That was disappointing as shape is always something I look at when I grab games.\n\nThe staff seemed nice, but there was some dude sitting on a stool chatting with the 2 guys behind the counter the whole time I was there, I do not know if he worked there, but he just seemed to be som regular just chatting and distracting the other two. \n\nI would recommend the place if you are nearby, and can hope they start bringing in more games as it looks like they get people's collection and all of the good games are gone as soon as they come in to \""reserves\"", so you may want to see about reserving a game if you are really after it."
0,"This is my second order, and by accident. I ordered from them months ago and swore never again. \n\nBut it just so happened that I get so many flyers on my door that this one slipped through. \n\nFirst things first. I ordered pork and veg. And chicken and veg for myself as I only eat chicken fish and turkey. Reason I say that is because I received chicken and veg, with shrimp and veg. Guess who's deathly allergic to shrimp.\n\nThe food was bland, dry and Luke warm. The fried rice is the worst I ever tasted. Salty, and dry. And not even that nice Brown nutty color of fried rice, I almost thought it was spoiled food. \n\nThe lady on the phone said she heard me say I wanted shrimp, that's a lie I'm not suicidal and don't have an eppi pen. Why would I order shrimp lady.\n\nAlso she was giggling when I asked her if she got a lot of complaints. I didn't check yelp before I placed my order, if I had this would all have been avoided.\n\nShe offered to refund my money forty min ago. If she does I will post it later, if she doesn't I will go postal. I only wish I paid with a credit card so I could dispute this, and not worry about a refund. It\n\nIf you're thinking about placing  an order, don't waste your money. It would be better spent on burritos out of the freezer at the local Circle K.\nNever again Chopsticks ???? Express?\n\nOk they delivered my refund. But not before I received my two subs from Jimmy Johns. Express...lol what a joke"
0,"Man, this place cost me a ton of money and did crappy work.  The brakes they use are metal, so the crud on my wheels was nasty and the life of the brakes was fleeting.  When they would fix one thing, lo and behold something else needed to be fixed.  Mainly my fuel pump, which caused my car to have major start issues once replaced.  The fuel pump was because my gas guage suddenly stopped working after they had replaced my struts.  They could never get my tires balanced.\n\nI regret the money they took from me and think about 1/2 the work they did on my car was not necessary."
1,"Used to be the Imperial Palace.  It is like a maze in there and it is outdated even though they are doing renovations.  It was very affordable and clean though.  The thing that bothered me was that my window on the 12th floor didn't lock.  Not that I would think someone would be stupid enough to go out on the balcony and walk into my room, but in Vegas, you just never know!"
3,"On way to Vegas was super hungry and thinking of the first spot to eat at..Yelped and found Earl of Sandwhich...was so excited. I went through the reviews and heard so much about the famous Montague so had to try it. It was tasty and overall good, however I expected it to have more of a wow factor. Not quite.. Wanted to try another one just to really have a 5 Star experience, but was too full. As for the service it was super fast and friendly, and organized. There is a variety of sandwiches and sides, and even deserts. So will definitely eat here again when visiting Vegas."
2,"I'm not sure when it happened, but this Rite Aid has added a full-on food section. I thought the aisles looked like they were closer together...\n\nIn terms of food, they basically have everything you'd find at a gas station with an extended mini mart with lots of drink options, dry and canned foods to prepare for sides or meals, and lots of snacks."
0,"wow really, i read the reviews and was expecting at least a good pizza, and this was one of the worst pizzas i have had, the sauce is way to sweet with the taste of vinegar, and very moist. I am a fan of the thin crust NY style pizza and this is not at all that type of pizza. the atmosphere is nice inside, although very crowded. better off getting pizza hut, doh.."
0,"There are not many wonderful old Vegas left in town.  My first trip to Golden Steer was a wonderful experience, fun full of history and great food. TIMES HAVE CHANGED.\nI will say the waiters are still very attentive and full of stories about the glory days of the Golden Steer - we heard our waiter tell 4 tables the same story. The decor fairly rundown but you can overlook it at times to try and get into the spirit of old Las Vegas.  The food tonight just plain not good and far too expensive for what it was.  The shortcuts are evident and the quality compeltely gone.  The frozen lobster tail was $100.  The New York steak had a prime rib au jus poured on top that shouldn't be there and on top of that was so obviously from a powdered packet that it was insulting.  The waiter suggested a twice baked potato that tasted like it had been in the refrigerator since my last visit two years ago.\nThe whole experience made me sad as we are obviously losing another Vegas landmark, as return customers at this time must be few and far between.\nBottom line we could have spent the same money or less at Botero or Scarpetta and been wowed by the food - truth is being mugged for the $500 would have been less painful then this meal."
4,"This is one of the best kept secrets of Queen Creek.  And it's slowly becoming less of a secret.  Somewhat hard to find, but beyond worth it.  \nMy family and I have still only done their lunches.  I have not tried the dinner, but hear great things about it.\nAs for lunch, this is one of the best places to grab lunch in the SouthEast Valley.  \nIt is not hard to understand why when you look at their supplier list.  All their ingredients are locally produced from Queen Creek.  Olive Mill, Shnepf Farms, and The Pork Shop to list a few.  \nYou must eat here at least once.  I personally love the Cuban sandwich.  Homemade pasta and potato salads are unique and very delicious as well."
1,2.5 stars\n\nI thought the food was mediocre and would easily recommend Lemongrass at Aria over Wazuzu....food was very similar to your standard Pan Asian fare at half the price.
3,"Juju K: Maybe you're confused because prime rib is not a steak at all, but a slice of roasted beef."
3,"If you won big at the tables and feel like being treated like royalty ... you've come to the right place.  \n\nThe Spa is pure luxury. Everything here is both expensive and opulent. \n\nI've had two couple's massages here and the first was far better than the second. The first was amazing, my body has never felt as revived as it did when I was finished getting the treatment. The second just didn't match up. \n\nThey have separate relaxation rooms for men and women before the massage. About 10 minutes before your massage they call you into a coed waiting room and from there you go to your massage. Everything is run with extreme efficiency and the customer service is exceptional. \n\nHow do you recover from a weekend's worth of partying in Vegas? A massage from the Canyon Ranch Spa is not a bad place to start."
2,"The owner, Lisa, was very nice and tried her best, but that was the only part I was happy with. The dresses here are very expensive, and if you happen to find some you like that are on sale, they will only work if you are a smaller size. I only tried on 3 dresses (the last of which I almost got stuck in), and they were all way too small - I felt very uncomfortable. I was told they could be ordered in my size (14), but there was no way I was going to order a dress that I had to attempt to picture myself in. If you have a large budget and are a smaller bride (my sister, who is a size 8, said she would not have been able to fit into any of those dresses either), I would recommend this store to you - otherwise, I would suggest going elsewhere."
2,"I like the food here, especially the lunsagna, living burrito, and any cheesecake or pie desserts.  However, I have found that the customer service for takeout at their new location is lacking.  I don't see any of the employees from the other location at the new, maybe everyone is learning.  It appears, from the three-four times I've been to the new location for takeout, that there is a smoothie person, there is a coffee machine/etc person, there are a few waitresses walking around, and then one person will be taking orders and payment for the people at the bar.  So because the smoothie person and random waitresses don't offer to take your credit card so you can pay and pick up your order, you must stand there for 10-15 min. until the one person working helps you.  I used to tip 20% plus on a takeout order, I just don't think it's worth it to go anymore."
3,"Small, local bar with New Mexican food. We went for happy hour on a Monday and ordered chicken quesdaillas and chicken nachos. The service was amazing. The bartender was our server and a hostess for the restaurant. Despite her having to hustle and bustle all around the restaurant, she kept up a happy and a very pleasant attitude and she kept an eye on our food and drinks at all times.\n\nThey had great beer on tap for hh ($3). The food was good but kind of heavy, but my husband said that New Mexican food is like that. I think we found our local reverse happy hour spot."
1,"So it's great the this Target opened up in East Liberty. Just beware of the ordering drinks at the cafe. My kids wanted an Icee and as we were waiting for this other family to get their drinks, I noticed a girl licking her cup/lid and then having the spouts touch her saliva slathered cup... basically all the flavors. Yeah, it's not Target's fault that the mom wouldn't correct her kid and tell her to not do that, but when I brought it up to the girls working there, one of the girls instructed the other girl to just wipe it with a napkin. So yes, a refund please and we went with the smoothie instead and that's why I'll go on Yelp to rate a Target."
1,"Most Chick-Fil-A's get 5 stars. This one gets 2, deducted one star for each time my order has been wrong in the last 3 visits. First, order a sandwich and nuggets, got a sandwich and fries. Next time, ordered two spicy sandwiches, got two regular ones, also asked for mayo, got 1 packet, um.... Tonight, ordered 1 spicy, 1 regular, was told I had to pull aside and wait for the spicy (no big deal), I said \""No problem, just please remember the mayo\"". They brought the order to me, I quickly checked to see if it wasz there (no mayo), I look up, she's gone (gee, thanks, I waited for you). Love this place, wax excited to get one on my route home, but Im not coming back to this one. Terrible management when you cant get your product out correctly."
3,"We are BIG fans!!!  Love this place! We went for the free dance lessons last week and are going again this week! Great live music 7 nights a week! Good service - though a bit confusing....   even if you have a tab at the bar - order from the waitresses that come around - you don't have to keep going back to the bar to place your order.  The waitresses are there to take care of you and that's what they do.  Aslo, because of the live music and dance lessons, etc. there is a  2 drink minimum to be prepared to have and pay for something.  But with music, food and service this good that shouldn't be a problem!  We also want to try the steak and enchaladas....  not sure if we're going to or not - but it's on our list of things to try!!!  We'll go back every time we are in Mesa/Scottsdale."
0,"I'm sad to write this review based on the staff but due to the rude doormen, my whole mood was ruined and I sat down at the bar but started getting angry the more I thought about it and then left without even ordering. Just a tip, don't insult people before they even walk through your doors. That is NOT the way to treat someone willing to give you their money. \nThe decor was super cute and the menu looked interesting. If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I may reconsider trying this place but rude people really put me off."
0,"I had a bad experience with Camelback Cleaners. I brought in a blanket and my sofa cover, I didn't get them back for three weeks.  When I dropped them off I was told to return in a week. When I did they told me they would need another week. Why they hadn't called to tell me this is beyond me. So I came back the next week and they told me the dry cleaners, they do not do the dry cleaning themselves, had misplaced my sofa cover but not to worry because they'd probably find it soon.  After another week they called and said they'd found it and I could pick it up. In the end it'd taken three weeks to get a clean sofa cover and a blanket that reeked of chemicals. It was upsetting."
2,"I have to tell you, this is a 2.5 star review masquerading as a 3-star review.  And I only went with three because our server happened to write something cute on the little card that they pass out with every check now.\n\nThe food was really \""meh\"" at this location.  I realize Olive Garden is not gourmet Italian food by any stretch, but the location I usually frequent has more more \""flavor.\""  \n\nWe also went and noon and were \""frowned upon\"" by the wine server for not tasting (sorry, fresh out of church - not on a date!) and were not even OFFERED the lunch menu until we asked (which is a savings of $3/plate.)\n\nAs I said, our waitress was about 4 stars, the rest of the place about 2.  I think a solid 2.5 is good."
0,Food was slow and cold when it finally gets to you. Wait staff was slow to take drink and food order. Bread made it to the table 20 minutes after we sat down. Lunch for five adults from start to finish took 90 minutes and it was not very busy on a Thursday! I will not go back again.
1,I've been going for pedicures for several years and have enjoyed the experience. Yesterday I made an appointment for myself and two friends. Unfortunately this was not a good experience. One of my friends has very ticklish feet and does not like them tickled. She explained to the technician she was there because her two friends talked her into it. The technician found it funny and tickled her feet. It was not a relaxing experience for any of us since we knew our friend was suffering.
4,"Love love loved it! We were right in the front with awesome seats. Got picked on by the performers about my huge tits. The show was incredible! Fascinating characters, inventive costumes, acrobats flying over my head, phallic symbols everywhere.. It was just awesome! I like the message they try to get across too."
3,"Best food ever!! Ignore those other nasty reviews about this place, it's above my expectations everyday when I come here! Friendly customer service, great prices, but the only thing that would make this 5 stars is if I could get the nutrition info on the food I am eating. Thanks!!!"
1,"Cheap food, every time I have gone they always have forgotten something I ordered, never came back to check on the table , and feels rushed . I feel kinda ripped off when I get small styrofoam cups for my drinks."
1,"We had high hopes for this haunted attraction, but found out early on no real screams coming from inside, only a long line with little shock value.\nGreat outdoor entertainment and rest room facilities which was a plus.\nPaying for parking and no real directions where to go once parked are negatives.\nFast pass only good for entry at the start but not once inside you wait like everyone else. First haunted house basically darkness with no real special effects. The 3d clown house was worth it and well done. The shootout part was disappointing. Good last effect with different rooms you are sent into chosen by the ghoul- not everyone goes the same way.\nProbably would rate 4th on our list of haunted attractions this year."
3,"Could not resist the 2for$39 price for admission so decided to check it out. I've been to the Museum in New York City back in 2002 and was excited to have an opportunity to visit the updated exhibits here in Las Vegas as I took a break from the Casinos where I wasn't doing so well.\n\nAs we approached the ever growing line of enthusiast the excitement started to build as my wife and I prepared our cameras for some major photo sessions with some of our favorite Celebs...probably the closest we'll ever get to the real thing without getting arrested. The staff was always efficient and friendly and kept the crowd under control ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience at Madame Tussauds.\n\nWe proceeded to the first level of lifelike replicas of the rich and famous snapping and enjoying ourselves in a room filled with \""Oooz\"" and \""Ahhhz\"" and continued on to each level of displays and exhibits doing the same, until we reached a room of super heroes where a crowd had gathered waiting to watch a 3D video. There apparently was some kind of delay and the rooms capacity was not enough to support the developing amount of people entering, so we , along with several others decided to continue on. Exiting through a door that led into a gift shop. I thought to myself (was that it?) There was something still missing from the whole experience. The Las Vegas museum lacks the tribute and fails to elaborate on the history of the Madame herself and some of her early works. Maybe the intent was to make it less gory and more family friendly. \n\nEven though I enjoyed my Las Vegas visit to Madame Tussads I still think that the Museum in New York was more of the total experience that the Museum has to offer."
4,"QUALITY. \n\nSo glad to find this gem in downtown Phoenix - so friendly, so good, such a great experience. Try it all and keep coming back. SO WORTH IT!"
3,The special thing about my when I saw the pandas plus had looked round elsewhere after
3,"Wow, we received a recommendation for this place from a local guide and he was right - this place was the best. Table side Guacamole was the best... But you MUST try the chicken torta - its definitely on my top ten things I've eaten around the world."
2,"So my experience with this place was as a perspective employee (not as a dancer, but as a hostess. It was a particularly dark moment in my employment history when I went in here to try to get a job.)\n\nI was immediately turned off. Everything was sticky...the bar where I sat down to fill out my employment application was covered in some kind of sticky funky ickiness. It was not sexy.\n\nThe dancers were lovely, and they seemed friendly...I hear this is Charlotte's best strip club, but I was just so skeeved out by the stickiness that I couldn't appreciate the rest of the environment. Also, the cheesy sex hotel behind the place freaks me out as well."
3,"The best homemade tortillas in Scottsdale!! Located in a historic adobe home in Old Town Scottsdale.  Dishes include ancho raspberry-encrusted pork chops and Shawnee sea bass with a cheese and rock shrimp quesadilla, topped with shoestring sweet potatoes. The banana crisp wrapped in a sweet tortilla with blackberry compote is out of this world."
1,"I think that rating an Olive Garden restaurant is like rating a McDonalds... kind of pointless and at best a 2-star experience along with all fast-food. But I'm kind of blown away that it would have a 4 out of 5 star Yelp rating alongside the likes of Pizzaria Bianco, Postino's, & Cibo."
0,"For those of you who only read partial reviews--this review is about Guitar Center as a COMPANY and not this individual location.  I admit that outright.\n\nI usually give 4s and 5s.  I'm one of those people who has positive things to say about just about anywhere...but not here.  Don't get me wrong--I have no problem with this individual location.  I have been trying to order something site-to-store from the parent company website for three days.  First, they advertised it as one price but as soon as it went into my cart it showed up as costing $100 more!  Because of our timeline, I ordered the item.  Well, Guitar Center must have a HUGE amount of fraud, because my credit card was instantly shut down (and I buy a lot of weird stuff, a lot of stuff online, spend money in different countries all the time, etc--this was NOT an expensive item, either)..  WOW!  So once I get that cleared up, I sent a screen shot of the original price--a price that I had confirmed via telephone with GC CS rep Preston.  They \""lost\"" my first screen shot.  I re-sent it, and uploaded it to a server to provide them with a URL...so this time they couldn't lose it.  All the while, EVERY agent asked me to call them on the phone to re-order.  I went through a friend's affiliate link after they told me about GC, giving them appropriate credit for the sale--so this unscrupulous company was actually trying to get out of giving credit under the terms of their OWN affiliate program!  So now they're claiming they have to cancel my order and I have to re-order via the phone, or they cannot honor their own coupon code.\n\nWell, the STORE might be just fine.  I don't know.  I didn't make it that far.  But I can tell you that the parent operation is questionable.  I'd rather give my business to a more ethical operation.  Sorry, GC Tempe...4 kids and who knows how many more musical instruments, and GuitarCenter.com lost you my business."
2,"Can't beat the view. However, though they have offer many various High end foods. The quality doesn't seem match the price. The service is great, the food is beautiful. But if the price matches the taste? I had better. Will not come back unless there is a special occasion and requested by anyone. Otherwise, it is not a must list."
2,I had fried shrimp and french fries which were okay. This salad is good as always the biscuits can't be beat. If you do want to try the biscuits at home sam'sclub has a fantastic mix I've tried them and they're worth it
3,"The Melwood Screening Room is part of Pittsburgh Filmmakers' headquarters...and I have to say, as cool as the concept itself is, it's a major pain to find this place! \n\nLet me back up a second. I recently went to the screening room for a wonderful documentary showing about human trafficking. While the topic in quesiton that night was certainly not 'wonderful,' the room, the set-up, the discussion and presentation of the topic was very well done; given the intimate-single screen nature of the Melwood Screening Room, this venue was definitely perfect for that showing. So I truly appreciate that Filmmakers has provided a place for people to show documentaries like that one, as well as a variety of other films that you wouldn't find on the mainstream silver screen. There's even a concession stand right outside the little room that Filmmakers operates, and it's not too shabby, either.\n\nI can't say I totally outright love the screening room though. The cost of an intimate viewing area is a lack of personal space; while the seats offer plenty of legroom, they offer very little distance between the people themselves. It kind of creates claustrophobic anxieties for me - nothing major, but still. Also, I really wish it was easier to actually find the Screening Room for first-time attendees. The elevator I had to use was tucked away and unmarked; it took me 15 minutes to find someone in the building who could point me to it. I'm just glad I found someone who could help me and that I made it to the showing on time...\n\nMy final verdict: this screening room is definitely an a-ok place to spend an evening and is local treasure in its own right, as is Filmmakers itself; despite the drawbacks I'd come back around for a big-deal showing, for sure - I pity the newcomers who have as much trouble finding the room as I did, though."
2,"Used to go there and get a bowl and load it up. Now they're monetizing it with three bowl sizes, previous cost is now the small bowl. Waiters are a bit agressive to get their tips.\n\nGreat food, every time, i like the shreaded beef with brown rice, oh yeah! A bit pricy though, like $15 out the door with tips."
1,"I LOVE TACOS ! ! ! ! !\n\nJust not these.... \n\nI was looking forward to delicious tacos on Cinco De Mayo, but Sadly I cannot claim this my favorite taco joint. Nothing screamed delicious at me and If I wouldn't have been starved, I might not have finished my vampiro. The salsa they included on it was so extremely spicy I had to chug the Dr. Pepper we were sharing. Our poor son was still hungry after leaving because he couldn't finish his tacos due to the heat. Our mouths were on FIRE! The boyfriend didn't mind it too much, but he's always had a thing for spicy. \n\nThe meat had flavor just no moisture. The taco filling ratio was off - not enough meat to toppings. They messed up our order in a few ways which is understandable since it was busy and there was only one cook (I'm assuming it was the husband). \n\nIt's a great location and a nice atmosphere on the inside, but I don't think I'll be back. Not unless the boyfriend wants to try it again later down the road. I won't be going out of my way though."
2,Lolo's is fine.  I've been a few times with friends.  The menu is unique and the portions are good.  A+ on selection.  The food is okay.  College kids love this place!
2,"[First time Out-of-Towner for Spring Training]\n\nSerious identity crisis going on over here...\n\nI'm boughie...I'm your typical mall...I have a food court...I have some restaurants...what is going on with this place? Gucci next to Bath and Body Works...okay, slight exaggeration, but what is going on around here?!?\n\nConfused and not much time to shop...we walked around and hit a few stores. This mall is interesting to say the least. At least it has a Nordies, that's always a plus. Interesting set up and selection of stores, but it got its job done, we shopped and spent money!!\n\nIt makes me understand the \""Snots\""dale reference completely..."
0,"This guy is the most arrogant, obnoxious, belittling, disregarding, supercilious, superior, snobbish, disdainful, lofty, haughty, smug, conceited \""doctor\"" in the valley. DO NOT GO TO HIM.\n\nDon't believe me? Read almost EVERY OTHER REVIEW on the internet about him."
0,"Super slow service, do not come here for food! The people are sluggish, moving super slow at everything. Not to mention the dishes here are expensive, it totally not worth it due to poor service. Come here and you will starve and lose your precious time!"
2,"Didn't know this was the original set for the tv series until I went inside. It's a shame how run down this place is. Their crew were nice, but you would think they would have some kind of uniform policies? But their food were very good, I have been here twice and both times it took them some time to get our food out."
1,"Its seems like a decent place, and certainly has potential, but we wont be back until its more sanitary.  My problem being VEGAN is that the meat station is at the beginning of the line.  This wouldn't be a problem if PEOPLE DIDN'T USE THE VEGETABLE TONGS TO SQUISH DOWN THEIR RAW MEAT into the tiny bowls provided.  I asked the line staff how they prevent cross contamination to which she replied \""I dont understand what that means.\""  Ok, fair enough, she isnt educated.  So I asked for a separate clean tong to use, even though I know that \""meat juices\"" are already mixed in with the veggies.  She said they only have one for each container, and no extra clean ones.  At this point I was just too grossed out to eat.  My husband, being a carnivore didnt mind, but has been in the bathroom \""declaring war on Mongolia\"" all evening, so I guess my theory could have been correct.  \nWe brought all this up to our waitress, as I would have like to have had dinner there, and she says its the corporate office's decision to have it that way, and had been asked this same question several times before. She mentioned that Muslims should absolutely NOT eat there, as there was NO way of knowing for sure if the food was cross contaminated with pork, and that the sign asking about \""allergies, and special dietary requests\"" was a joke. \nUntil they switch up the order of the stations, Veggies Beware!"
1,"This place is going through an identity crisis. Obviously owned by the Suki Hana next door, there's just a few things here that are really scream Cajun. Blackened fish? Check. Bourbon Chicken? Check. But chow mein and steamed vegetables in soy sauce? Um no. Being served by an entire staff of Chinese people doesn't fool me neither. \n\nNow the bourbon chicken tasted good enough and you pay about $6 a plate. But their Asiatic version of black bean rice was flat. They should try to create some side dishes to go with the main course meat that you know, are actually Cajun. Like French bread, pea soup, jambalaya rice, Cuban soup or even stuffed peppers. At least the meat was thoroughly cooked and not too greasy. \n\nThe seating is horrible. On any given Sunday, you can sit in their cramped food court and it's almost certain that some fat chick with an oversized diaper bag and her toddler with a leg sticking out will walk behind you, bumping into every chair. And you can forget about trying to carry a conversation in this place."
3,"The rates are great and the suites are spacious and well-laid out.  I would avoid the studios, since they are notoriously small.  We stayed in a Villa suite.  The suite was clean and well-designed and it also had a gorgeous and huge bathroom with 2 sinks and a tub the size of a small jacuzzi.  The room also had a small full kitchen in it including a full size refrigerator, a microwave, a stove, a dishwasher and a complete set of dishes, pots and pans.\n\nThe bedding was really nice and comfortable and I loved the pillows so much that I bought one of them.\n\nI did not receive a good orientation checking in and I had added a day onto my stay and I was not thrilled that the days weren't combined.  I had to get the room keys rescanned on Sunday and also get another parking pass with Sunday's date on it.  I had no idea that there was a pool on the roof or that there was a convenience store somewhere on the property.  I found this out later while reading other guest's reviews after arriving home.\n\nThe service I received was really good for the most part.  I did not care for the check-in, because it took a long time and I didn't get all of the facts about the hotel.  Most of the staff was extremely helpful and accommodating, including the security guy.  The first issue that I had was with the thermostat.  We had been traveling in the heat all day long and I wasn't feeling well and I couldn't get the thermostat below 68 degrees.  I called up the front desk and asked if they could do anything and they got the engineer to lower it a couple of degrees.  That was awesome.\n\nThat said, however, I was less than thrilled with the housekeeping staff.  I needed to leave and called up for some towels and it took over half an hour to get them.  When they finally got there, I was actually on the phone asking for the manager.\n\nThe bellhops were both nice and very helpful, but there didn't seem to be enough of them to go around, especially at checkout time.  Polo Towers doesn't allow you to just borrow the cart, so you have to wait for a bellhop.  When I went to the bellhop desk to ask for assistance for checkout, I actually had 5 people in front of me waiting for one.  Give yourself an extra 20 minutes if you need a bellhop.\n\nThe checkout is kind of early - at 10 AM.  A late checkout is 11AM.  I am not a morning person, so a later time or a little more flexibility with the time would have been nice.  A forewarning for those other non-morning people out there - get out on time or they charge you a $50 fee for checking out late."
4,"This place is amazing. If you really like good food...if you really like eating somewhere where there is a solid appropriate wine list....GO HERE. EAT HERE! ENJOY HERE.We like good food...we had the special steak, and duck fat fries (omigawd!) ...but the seasoning, the sides, the care by the wait staff..made it an evening you want to share with every one...yes, its a bit noisy...but only at the bar....not in the dining room...it was intimate...multi guest friendly...make a reservation and enjoy the food..really enjoy the amazing the food. Make this one of your stops in Edinburg....please..."
2,It's getting better as the new owners remodel and get in some new tenants.
4,This place has the best tacos and burritos! For  meat eater or vegetarians.
0,"Firstly, they do not allow their special as a take out, so as a working woman who does not have time to sit at a restaurant for lunch, I don't get to enjoy the specials? Maybe I don't get out much but that was definitely a first. So I place an order for delivery and what arrived was not what I ordered,  despite the fact that the delivery guy checked and assured me the order was correct. I asked for a wheat bun and did not get one, they say their burgers come with lettuce, pickles, onions, tomatoes, and a sauce, my \""burger\"" was a wet bun, a pattie and some cheese (mainly stuck to the foil and paper wrapper. Then to top it all off, the fries were stale, like leftover reheated fries and were not edible in my opinion. This was my first and will be my LAST meal at Burger Rush, what you get is definitely NOT worth what you pay for!! TERRIBLE!!"
1,This place would get five stars if I were 21 and drunk at 2:30am on a Saturday night.  Unfortunately for OG neither point factors into this review. \n\nThe food would repulse a real Greek person.  The fries were a saving grace.
2,"The food at Flavor's was pretty good, as was the selection of food! I was impressed with some of their desserts. We had a good waitress, which we were pleased about because our last buffet experience prior to this one was very unsatisfactory. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, with so many other amazing options in Las Vegas that I still want to try, but I certainly wouldn't be against it if we were already in Harrah's & decided we were hungry."
3,"Maybe because I'm Asian, but I was not surprised by the surroundings.  It's typical for a place that charges \uff0420 an hour.  C'mon, if you want ambience then go to the big fancier spas that charge $100 for 50 mins and then charge 18% automatically for a tip. These are just honest, hardworking (and friendly) people.  Don't be too worried about the language barrier cuz THEY know what they are doing.  Just lie back and enjoy.  I will agree with the person that bought a groupon (as I did) for $28 for a 90 minute reflexology.  It clearly states Tea, fruit and snacks but was never offered any either.  I didn't care because it didn't state face, head and body massage included either and I got those. It also included a detox foot bath that supposedly draws nasty stuff from your liver, etc.  I don't know if it really works or not BUT the water WAS black afterwards.  I had Fanfan.  She's a tiny thing.  I don't know how she did it but she WALKED on my back and it felt good.  I just don't understand how 85 lbs (?) on my back didn't feel like what I thought 85 lbs would feel like.  Don't hesitate to try this establishment and don't forget to leave a decent tip. $5 in my opinion (as one person before me did) just doesn't cut for someone that gave you an hour of pure bliss."
0,"We ordered pop up pizza last night and it was great. So great in fact that we decided to order it again tonight. We asked for delivery to our apartment, we gave them our cc info, everything seemed fine. Almost 30 minutes later we get a phone call and the guy said that they don't deliver to our apartment... Except that they had delivered to us the night before. So we asked if it would be possible to do it tonight at all. He said no. So we asked why it had taken so long to get back to us. He said they tried to call us but no one answered. Then we asked if we should call somewhere else and they could just lose our business to which the guy hung up the phone with no answer. It's really a shame because the pizza is really good. The service tho... We're shocked at how terrible it is. We will NOT be ordering from pop up any longer. :("
4,One of the best ramen spots I've ever been to by far. Def try it if your around this area.
4,"I'm a guy. A guy who likes good sandwiches. These are great sandwiches.  So, if you're a guy (or gal) who like sandwiches then you need to check this place out. Soft bread, quality meats piled high, a garlicky \""house dressing\"" which really brings it all together = the perfect lunch. Top that with friendly people working and you have a hit. You may be tempted to order more sub than just the \""shorty\"" 6 incher but let me assure you that this will put you in the satiation zone and then some. \n\nNow to spread the word, and my own selfish agenda, to keep places like this growing.\n\n-------\nUpdate Feb '13:\nSTILL consistently great food and wonderful service. Considering my ever increasing number of check ins it probably goes without saying that I'm a big fan."
3,"One of the better locations around town, this one has a drive thru and a patio! While the patio is nothing major as it looks out over the parking lot (typical Las Vegas views), it does provide a nice option to enjoy the nice weather that graces us for a total of three months out of the year.\n\nThey're very speedy here, and customer service has always been top notch! The employees are patient and take their time with you, and the drinks are fabulous as always."
4,"We learned about this place shortly after they opened; we saw it driving by on 75th Ave and wondered what it was.  Then my daughter mentioned her friend worked there, so decided to try it out.\nFirst, it's kind of cool to have someone waiting at the door and open it for you with a huge smile, hand you a menu and ask if you've been there before.  Our first time, she spent time going over the process with us, even though the place was jumping busy.  Once in line, there were a bunch of people working behind the counter and all were nothing but smiles and great attitudes.  We were through the line quickly with the sandwich and half-salad combo and drinks which came to $22.44.  Not bad at all.  The sandwiches were delicious, the \""half\"" salads were huge and fresh and loaded with goodies and there are a lot to choose from.  I want to try a full salad next time and we have yet to try the soup.  I like the baguette slice and the chocolate dipped strawberry too, nice touch!   Cafe Zupas has become our Friday night dinner place now; our goal is to eat our way through the menu.  And...THANK YOU to all the staff for spectacular customer service."
1,"Went to Sanctuary this past week only because Travel Zoo came out with a great deal for $99.00 including you choice of two add ons. You could choose from the foot treatment, hand treatment and opal eye treatment. I chose the hand and foot treatment and added on the opal eye treatment for an additional $15.00. I would definitely skip the opal eye treatment it is not worth it and did nothing for my eyes. \n\nSTAFF:\nFirst, everyone at the spa was very friendly and they make you feel welcome.\n\nWAITING AREA\nWhile waiting for your treatment, they have lemon water, tea, almonds and green apples. I had water but would have liked to have some other fruit. I have been to other local spas and they offer a wide array of fresh fruit.\n\nAt about 9:30 a.m. which I have been told it a very busy time, about 7 therapists come out a door at the same time and start randomly calling names to for their treatments.\n\nWOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM:\nThe inside of the women's locker room, not really impressive but clean and well organized. The steam room was nice but the jacuzzi was lacking. It was like a warm bubble bath with very little pressure coming from the jets. Since my muscles were sore, I was really looking forward to the jacuzzi. There is always staff in the locker room in case you need help with anything, which is nice. \n\nMASSAGE:\nMy therapist was friendly. I had an average massage definitely not the best ever here in the valley but doable for $99.00. I am glad I did not go there and pay full price! It did seem like the therapist was in a hurry maybe due to the add ons. \n\nPOOL: \nThe pool was nice but nothing exceptional for such a high-rated resort. The food was really good at the pool and the servers were attentive to your needs."
3,Try the shrimp tacos!!!
1,"Not a very pleasant experience as I had set a very high expectations for this place. We were a party of 8, got a table and until that point everything was OK, the wait wasn't too bad. Off coarse, we get a waiter that all hyped up and was rushing us to order, I ask for some Salsa and Chips, he acted all surprised and said that he will charge me for it, OK, no problem. Then we go on and I asked for a green salsa and his reply was \""you can have whatever you want\"" not to mention he was going to tag me with additional $9.00 for Guacamole dip, well I asked for green Salsa not a dip. We go on without any complaints as we all felt the situation was weird. The food comes in, I ordered the fish of the day, Scottish Salmon, good plate presentation until the plate tasted like all SALT, went on and tried to eat as we were all starving, it got to the point where I could not continue. Mentioned it to the MOD and she did a great job by addressing it. Bottom line, it wasn't a well perceived experience."
2,"I've actually never stayed in this hotel, but I have visited it plenty.  They have a lot going on here.  I like that they are connected to Mandalay Bay, which I am also a fan of.  I LOVE sneaking onto the elevators that go diagonally... I mean, how freaking cool is that?  They have some great exhibits (Bodies/Titanic) and shows (Believe, Jabbawockis, etc) and they have that yummy Tacos and Tequila restaurant right smack in the middle of it all.  I also checked out LAX Nightclub and I liked it so much better than both 1 Oak and Pure.  It was much bigger and has several floors.\n\nOverall, this is a fun place to hang out and stay busy."
0,"I'm basing this rating totally on the poor attitude of the staff.  I was with a co-worker and we had some time to kill before our flights took off.  We were looking for a place to eat in the airport other than Burger King or some fast food place.  From a distance, this place just looks like a bar.  Liquor bottles lining shelves around a bar inside the airport.  I did not see one cook like the pictures show below.  Anywho, we order a sandwich from Quizno's which is will be a Yelp in itself.  There was no place to sit in this airport.  Because of all the flight delays, the airport was crowded but this place had a bunch of empty tables in the center by their bar and stores.  Now I know why. My co-worker and I set our stuff down and she leaves to use the restroom.\n\nUp walks what appeared to be cleaning staff.  She certainly didn't look like a waitress and asks me if I'm ordering anything off the menu.  I said, you mean liquor? I said, maybe after I eat.  Broomhilda says in crusty tone, \""no, food\"".  I laughed and said, honey all I see is liquor and I may need some of that after I eat.  She proceeds to talk to me in her crusty tone and said, I can't sit there unless I order from the menu.  Since I've been gate raped by TSA in the past, I figured I don't want to create a security scene and I take our food and move along.\n\nI really wanted to tell her to stick her attitude up her hoohah and stick to cleaning tables.\n\nQuestion below: Waiter Service? How about Biatch Service."
1,"We arrived around 420pm. The place opened at 4pm however you couldnt order food until 5pm or there after. Which seemed strange, dont you think that as soon as you open the kitchen should be ready to go?    I had a bad feeling when seeing that the place was packed and the Kitchen was going to crash.  I was right, it Crashed!! because 90% of the people ordered food all at once. It took forever to get our food, and when it arrived not eveything came out. It happened to all the other tables around us. The fries were luke warm and boy did they scrimp on the portions.  It seemed that they \""stood at the door\"" and threw just a handful to the plate with the fish!!  One of our friends didnt even get his Fish and Chips, apparently was taken to the wrong table. I think their portions should be bigger and its misleading when on the menu it says \""Large Plates\"", because you expect a big plate of food.  That certainly was not the case. \n\nIt seemed liked they really were not prepared. They were disorganised, lack of training and communication.  Servers not knowing the correct table numbers therefore delivering wrong food. A big cluster!!!  The Chef should pre shift the servers before opening letting them know what they didnt have on the menu. Our server came back to us twice because what we had ordered they did not have.   Would also recommend Salt,Pepper,Sauce Caddy's on the tables. Napkins and Clean Polished Siverware would be nice. We had to ask for all that.  \n\nOther than that the place had a good atmosphere, the beer tasted great.  Would like to see this place to be sucessfulI, however they will need to  improve with service and food. \n\nMaybe we will come back in a few weeks to give them another chance and hope they have worked out these issues."
4,"Great, great food. Any chicken lover should pay a visit, and this will be the first of many. The peri peri sauce is a delight and the chicken.. oh the chicken. Every single bite gives the signal the start of multiple oesophagus' orgasms.\nThis is by far the best Nando's in town in terms of atmosphere and place. Try out the any chicken dish you wish for and add from a variety of sides and spicy sauces to have a healthy and at the same time delicious lunch."
4,Tierney is awesome! She was recommended to me from a friend and haven't been anywhere else. I get so many complements. I highly recommend her if you are look for the most professional lashes.
1,"I was working at the Hard Rock Hotel for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there.\n\nThe service at Pink Taco was terrible! I was placing an order for take out and the girl at the counter was so rude. She acted as though I was really bothering her and that I was stupid. This is completely unacceptable.\n\nThe food at Pink Taco was alright. Not terrible, not that good either. I had the Baja Fish tacos. The plate included three street sized tacos, rice, and beans.\n\nThe tacos tasted fine, but the fish inside was measly. Also, the texture on one was totally overcooked and tough.\n\nIf you can, skip this place. There are better options at Hard Rock (e.g. Culinary Dropout, Nobu) and much much better options at other hotels."
1,"This place should rename themselves to Hello Beijing or Hello China. This is not a typical Japanese restaurant. Their entrees are definitely prepared in Chinese cooking style and rolls taste way different then what you expect. Vegetables are cooked with oil and soy sauce and garlic. They taste like grilled vegetables from Chinese restaurant.  Also, Make sure you read what is in there. Ex) Crunch roll has cream cheese instead of shrimp tempura. \nEntrees are a bit pricy and you will feel like this food taste like the first Chinese plate you ever made."
4,"This business tends to have the cleanest, best mid-century pieces in Las Vegas by far. Their prices are fair for the level. They've moved from Main St & now are by appointment I believe, but it's definitely worth the time. Great owners too, a pleasure to deal with."
3,"If you are a fan of genuine Philadelphia Cheesesteaks, you will love this little \""hole in the wall\"" place right off Trop and Pecos.  The cheesesteaks are so good that we get one every week, and the shakes and malts are to die for, no kidding.  It's an old style diner, don't expect fancy, but it is very good, with lots of different sides and philly favorites. (Tastykakes, etc.) The only reason I don't give it five stars is that the service is slow and a lot of times outright unfriendly.  I suggest you grab one of the take out menus, call your meal in so it's ready for you when you get there, then take it home.  But definitely a regular choice for us.\n\nI am editing this review on 3/3/13 to reflect the fact that the place seems to have changed hands, or at least have new managers and it's not quite as good as it was.  Maybe a 3-star instead of a four star rating now .... ;("
1,"Before you freak out at the 2 star rating, let me explain myself.  My scale usually goes like this - 3 stars is average (duh), a place I wouldn't necessarily put effort into going to but I wouldn't be totally disappointed if somehow I wound up there.  2 stars would be somewhere I likely wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend to others.  For what T Cooks is trying to be, it is not worth a return trip for me.  Not that the food, decor, service, or anything was that terrible, but for the price there are far better fine dining establishments.  There is absolutely no reason to choose T Cooks or allow others to choose it. \n \nOk - so this review is based solely on my experience at the wine bar/lounge area and not the actual restaurant.  I was meeting a group of friends here for a cozy cocktail before we all took off to our various locations of origin for the holidays.  On a Tuesday night at 7, the lounge area was PACKED.  I couldn't believe it.  I arrived with my husband and there was only one other person from our party at the bar.  So I scouted the place out and swooped in like a hawk when I saw a party vacate a nice plush couch in the back corner.  \n \nThe decor is very cozy - wood fireplaces going, low lighting, oak tables, plush couches, beautiful patio - very Spanish villa.  But I guess that this place used to be a Spanish-villa influenced private estate, so no surprise there. \n \nSo after being seated, we waited for a server.  And waited.  We noticed only one server in the entire lounge, and people were literally lining up to talk to her, either to get her attention or to simply put in orders.  It turned out she was the only server for the whole lounge!  That's not her fault, but that is definitely some poor management right there. \n \nWe ordered some food off the lounge menu and some drinks and proceeded to enjoy ourselves with our friends over the course of the next 3 hours.  I started with the Pinot Grigio and my husband had the 007 martini (or the James Bond martini?  something like that).  Both were good.  For food, we selected the calamari in aioli, the charcuterie plate, and the tenderloin burger.  The calamari was interesting to say the least - the aioli was very watery and almost mayo-y, kind of like cole slaw.  Um, ok?  The tenderloin burger was very plain.  The boursin cheese was creative but it didn't do much to help.  The applewood smoked bacon could best be described as stale - it was extremely brittle, almost hurt to bite into.  It wasn't even that it was \""crispy\"" because even when bacon is properly prepared crispy it's still a little chewy. \n \nThe charcuterie plate never came.\n \nOver the 3 hours, the crowd died down and we were able to enjoy a little more relaxing atmosphere.  But the service never improved.  Rarely did the server return to our table to check on us.  One of our friends ordered a tenderloin burger much later in the night, and it took almost 45 minutes to get to him.  After our first drinks, I ordered the Sauvingon Blanc and my husband the Russian Valley Pinot Noir.  The SB tasted like pickle juice and my husband exclaimed that it was potentially the worst PN he had ever had.    \n \nAt the end of the night we got the check.  $117.  For a mediocre burger, strangely prepared calamari, a cocktail, a beer, and 4 glasses of wine between my husband and I (two of which were terrible).\n \nNot worth it.\n \nWorse, out of curiosity I took a look at the regular restaurant menu.  3 entrees with mushrooms (I hate mushrooms), 1 with duck (to which I'm allergic), and 2 were seafood (based on the calamari, I wouldn't go for the seafood).  \n \nSo there is absolutely nothing here I would eat.  No reason to return, whatsoever."
4,"This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great. There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!"
1,"One admission price gets you into the Dolphin Habitat and the Secret Garden (listed separately however and will review on it's own) . For 2 adults and 2 children, the price was $69.  Many other Yelp reviews commented that the dolphins appeared sad and mistreated.  I cannot read dolphin emotions and did not see any outward evidence of abuse.  I just thought the whole place looked old and sad. You can watch the dolphins in the first pool from above or below. There was a second pool where some trainers were hanging around with the dolphins   They answered some questions but I did not find them to be particularly enthusiastic, informative or knowledgeable.  Before we left they started a \""show\"" highlighting the people who had paid the big bucks to be \""dolphin trainers for the day\"".   Well, I don't think they really learned to train so well because the tricks the Dolphins did were pretty weak.  \n\nI recall visiting Dolphin Habitat about 20 years ago and being very impressed.  However, I don't think anything has changed about this place since then. It really needs a huge maker-over. This is a very poor value (even with the Secret Garden)  and I would not recommend it."
4,The only bad thing bad about this place is they are a cleveland browns bar and I am a diehard steelers fan. Food is friggin awesome and pizza is half off on the week ends. Chicken wings are equally awesome with ranch that is utterly addictive. And for all the fools below hating about the  smoking. Dude it's a bar. A BAR. Get over it.   More people need to go here
1,"Okay Indian food. Bit overpriced. The naan is big and fresh. The service is sub par. I ordered an aloo paratha once and the owner brought me a regular paratha. Did you think I didn't know? The vindaloo tastes okay. The lassi is waaayyy too thick. They do have mango kulfi, which Ambar does not. But 10 out of 10 times I would go to Ambar."
1,"Et tu, Aria?\n\nSeems like this hotel has joined the long list of other resorts that have thrown away customer service, simple common sense AND appreciation for their paying customers customers. I was there for EDC Weekend (June 8-11) and, I have to agree with my fellow yelpers there, that the check-in fiasco has left a bitter taste even a week after the trip. The first thing you expect to do when arriving at your vacation destination is check-in, drop off your luggage, and relax! All of this could not be done because our arrival was met with a 2.5 hour long line of disgruntled travelers standing static and clueless to a computer system failure. I understand that technical issues happen and they can be beyond the control of any employees. But I ask, where was the foresight in attempting a massive computer system overhaul prior to one of the busiest weekend of the season?? Being an EDC sponsored hotel with and incoming of +300,000 guests to Vegas, a Manny Pacquiao Fight, Stanley Cup Finals, and NBA Playoffs? Aria did little, and by little I mean nothing, to compensate for the wait, computer meltdown, and inconvenience other than putting out some stanchions  to make it feel like a ride and handing out bottles of water. We aren't thirsty we are tired from a 4 hour drive or a plane trip. We got things to do and nowhere on a person's weekend plans should it include standing in line for hours with little information on the status of the situation.\n\nWe were 10 minutes away from booking a room at the Paris down the way that boasted no lines and a rapid check-in as we were on a tight schedule when FINALLY they opened the check-in counters and started the process. We were near the front luckily and got through surprisingly fast from that point on. I'll give the hotel that, their staff handled it like an all-hands-on-deck black friday sale. By the end of the trip our promises of compensation seemed to be unfamiliar to the front desk upon check out. After ten minutes back and forth we got the resort fees removed from our room and oddly enough our total still came out higher than what we allegedly booked for through ARIA and EDC's \""Great Deal\"". At the end of the day this was Aria's second chance to impress me. It was my return visit there. And even the first time, on a friday night, mid January, with no line at all, it took us a 45 minutes to check-in after the front desk couldn't find our reservation...\n\nThis hotel looks great, something straight out of the future and it's a real testament to modern architecture. It's luxurious to the pinnacle of definition all the way down to the perfume adorned air to the auto curtains that slide open upon entering your room. But aside from all the aesthetic oooh's and aaah's this place soils itself when it comes down to the brass tax and the fundamental functions of any good business, that is of course, customer service. For the amount of money you spend here, it would behoove you to spend it at some place just as nice and with service that far surpasses this place. Cosmo, Venitian, or Encore are fine choices."
4,Amazing place to stay... Great suites!!! Very modern!!!
0,"Gee, I want to give them 2 stars (fast service), but it was the most puny veggie burrito I've ever had.  It was small and deflated, not enough of everything.   I even got guacamole and sour cream (extra).  Way overpriced for what you get (no tortilla chips)."
2,"When I last stayed here...it was THE Hotel, and would have rated that 5 stars. Loved it, amazing interior, just great experience. \nNow being at The Delano, it's only getting 3 stars. The decor is a little more retro looking, and I liked that darkness of the previous design. It's now a little more bland and less 'sexy' looking. I can't remember ever hearing loud music when I was here last either. In our current room-the music from somewhere is blaring and the tv doesn't even cut it out. Maybe we are on a different side this time, but should it matter? Shouldn't rooms be semi sound proofed? I can hear people yelling! What the heck?!? This is quite a different experience than last, and sadly this will be the last."
0,"Worst service I have ever experienced. Sat for 15 minutes before we were even asked for a drink order. Waited another 13 until HALF our drink order came (water) and took another 10 minutes before our beers and cocktails arrived. Food took forever. And our server was completely rude. He would barely look at me in the eyes while talking, rolled his eyes at me, and he never smiled- we were definitely not welcomed. This was my FIRST time at Bdubs and I'll never return to this location... Maybe never another bdubs location again. THANKS ANTHONY for a horrible Saturday night out with my friends and family."
1,"What I ate here:\n\n- Fried rice: great portion and very good!\n- Spring rolls: NOT GOOD\n- Tapioca: was more like a dessert smoothie? It was good, but I would like something that I could have with my meal\n\nI would come back here, but it would need to be amazing for me to return again for a second time!"
2,"Came here for lunch and was immediately seated. \n\nHostess showed me the lunch specials, but I was there for Dim Sum! \n\nHad the usuals, BBQ pork bun, Shu Mai, and Shrimp dumplings. I would have ordered more, but when it just you, that was plenty. I do wish the servers would explain more of the items on their carts. I am adventurous eater and love to try new things, but it was difficult to understand what some of the dishes contained. \n\nIts great to have a place on the southeast side for dim sum. Looking forward to going back with friends and trying more.."
2,"What counts as a \""pub\""? This is just a small dive bar.\n\nStaff was friendly. They don't kick people out right away after 2. You can stick around here. I went to ask for a menu just to see what they offer here. I just wanted a paper take-away menu but she was going to hand me an official menu. Would she have served me food after 2am?! There's just no way...\n\nThe pool table is tiny. It's the smallest table I've seen.\n\nThe food is not pub food. At least, not any pub food I've ever seen. Most everything is $6 or under. The Friday Fish Fry is $6.50. Saturday Night New York Steak is $10.25.\n\nTip: Park in the rear. Use the back door."
2,"The food is decent considering the degree of competition in Phoenix.  The service, however, is fantastic.  Great people, great place."
2,"As a metal head I was introduced to 1059 The X with David Draimen's \""monkey noise\"" in the song Down With the Sickness by Disturbed back in 2001 and have rarely changed the dial since. Over the past 10 years the station seems to have struggled keeping a hard rock format and have since incorporated a TON of alternative rock and \""stoner music\"" (think Bob Marley, Sublime, 311, etc.). Honestly, I only like around 55% of the music I hear on this station anymore. So what keeps me listening from 6:30am when I start my morning commute till 3:00pm when my personal opinion of Mark Madden makes me put on my iPod or satellite radio? The DJs. And I don't count \""Double M\"" \""The Super Genius\"" aka MALE CHAUVINIST PIG, as a DJ. \n\nIn the morning, Tim and Bob keep me laughing with stories and jokes, and dumb callers. They keep me up to date on local, national news, international news, sports, and celebrity gossip. But the show is geared more towards the male demographic, so there is stripper and boobie talk as well. There are daily hilarious Darwin Award styled stories called \""Shallow End of the Gene Pool\"" and a weekly \""Dumb Dumber and Dumberest\"" segment where you can vote for the call that was the \""dumbest moment from the week that was.\"" Every Friday they will also play a \""Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader\"" style game where a caller plays against an attractive girl for prizes. If you don't mind some sexism, Tim and Bob will keep you entertained. \n\nDuring the working hours, Whipping Boy takes over the radio. Whip has a nice loyal fan base, and no wonder. He is genuinely a nice guy and does a lot of good in the community. Whip starts his program at 10am by playing 9 songs from the 90's. Every day at noon he, with listener help, chooses a theme and plays 6-8 songs to fit the theme. Examples include, 90's songs, Y2K songs, songs with colors n the title, etc. At around 1:15pm he plays the day time pick of the litter, where he plays a song and listeners vote via phone or text messaging on whether to keep the song or \""Dio\"" it. If a song is \""Dio-ed\"" Whip plays Rainbow in the Dark and belts along to the lyrics to \""cleanse the musical palate from the awful pick\"". Alby Oxenreiter makes an appearance daily as well to talk sports. Whipping Boy does charity work. He frequently hosts successful blood drives and, as a dog lover, has the Washington Area Humane Society bring in a dog every Thursday to try and find him/her a home. (Can you tell I LOVE Whip?) \n\nMark Madden is on from 3pm-6pm. 'Nuff said. \n\nThen Abby takes the air from 6pm-10pm(?). \n\nNot the best station if you prefer older metal, but then again there aren't any good stations in the Pittsburgh area for that kind of fix."
2,"Wanted to find a place to buy tortillas since I moved here. When I seen this place off of Grand, I had to stop here and try it out! I bought two dozens of flour and corn tortillas, one pork, one cheese tamale, and a bag of tortilla chips! The only item I was impressed with was their chips??? Their corn tortillas was OK, nothing special! Tends to break apart while trying to eat it. Flour tortilla had no flavor, just pain piece of bread. Tamale was OK. I could name four restaurant you can get a better tamale at. So, I was happy with my chips anyway! great flavor, not to much salt. Being from SoCal, their were plenty of tortilla shops better then here, hopefully I can find another place to try?"
2,"Found out about this place from watching Diners Drive-ins and Dives. You know, one of those local joints that Guy Fieri raves about....This is their second location. It's tucked in the way back of a strip mall. Your GPS may lead you to the wrong location just an FYI. After finally finding this place, we walked into a large, 'clean', restaurant, set up like a high school cafeteria. The tables are plastic portable tables. The wall decor is mostly posters tacked up on the walls with thumb tacks like a teenagers bedroom. Place was not busy at 6:30 on a Friday,. However, the girl at the register was impatient with us like there was an invisible line behind us that only she could see... it would have been nice if she would have asked if this was our first time, explain things to us and give us samples. The food combinations kinda make the place smell funny like the sewer was backing up...  I dunno, maybe i just have an overly sensative nose. My hubby didn't notice it at all....You are probably thinking, \""where is she going with this review?!? Well here I go to the most important part...the food!! The ordering system is a bit weird. I guess there are millions of options, but only a few are pictured on the wall behind the counter. When it arrives to your table, it's in a round disposable tinfoil container, perfect for take home transport! I had a rice bowl with red jade chicken and fried rice. Yum!! The fried rice was really good, a bit different from, let's say the Panda variety;) The red jade chicken had great flavor but was a little dried out like it was pre-made and sitting under a heat lamp for hours. My hubby got the combo plate with plain fried rice, black beans, jerk chicken and machaca. All of which he devoured like he'd never ate before! He said it was all fantastic! I tried some of his plate and I would have to agree! Best part of the meal, the giant snicker doodle cookies, made fresh! \nNut shell, food was good! Not awesome, but good! We'll definitely be back! Might have to try the \""original location\"" next time!!"
2,"We saw the groupon deal and hadn't visited this buffet in over 10 years so we decided to try it again.  Our favorite buffet in Vegas the last couple years has been the Wynn, which is what we use as a marker now.  This didn't come close to matching the comparison, but with the groupon it wasn't a bad deal.  The Brie and bacon macaroni and cheese was by far our favorite dish, and I enjoyed the crepe station.  The soups were good, the beef bourguignon was authentic according to my husband that lived in France for a couple years.  I'm giving it three out of five stars because we decided it wouldn't be a place we would return to and pay full price - not worth the money."
3,"I can definitely see the hype with this place. \n\nD'Artagnan, Strawberry drinks were all delicious and well...endowed haha.\n\nQuiche & chicken/waffles were all delicious as well, no complaints there. Would love to come back if time permits.\n\nOnly complaint is they called our name but we didn't hear it so we waited longer than necessary. Maybe you could have tried again? Or gotten the name right? I take brunch very seriously and you don't want to see me with the hangries!"
3,"The Beatles Love Show was pretty good.  Went with two other couples and everyone seemed to enjoy the whole show, from the flying around, acrobatic moves, to of course, the Beatles music they performed to.  This is definitely a show to watch in Vegas for all ages.\n\nOverall, good show, okay price to watch."
4,I was there last Saturday afternoon and not only were the burgers and fries amazing but Mandy was the best server I have had. Very sweet and on top of it and very tentative. Highly recommend!
1,"I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately my check-in experience left me very disappointed and pretty much skewed my whole impression of the place towards the negative side.  Mercedes helped us and was pretty unfriendly, unprofessional and incompetent.  My family and I were here for a wedding and had reserved two rooms with two queen beds which I had specified needed to be next to each other.  These reservations were pre-paid and supposed to be guaranteed but it turned out that they \""ran out of double rooms\"" which was a big disappointment and very inconvenient but would've been easier to accept had Mercedes been more apologetic - she proceeded to try and say that I did not in fact reserve a double (said with attitude), so I had to show her my printed out reservation which clearly said \""two double queens\"" and then when she realized she was in the wrong, gave a bit more of the attitude! On top of that, she could not put our rooms nearby- in fact they were 20 rooms apart!!Unbelievable!! Totally inconvenient since I was traveling with two young children and two elderly grandparents.  To make a long story short, the front desk is really where the first impression is made.  When you have incompetent, unprofessional people working there, it just makes the whole establishment look really bad! The service throughout the rest of the resort was hit or miss and always slow: you either got someone really helpful (the bellboy) or a complete idiot (waitress at the pool), there's no consistency or high standard for great service here.  The room itself was nice and spacious, however not ideal when traveling with kids: no locks on bathroom door, mini bar and snack bar that's very easily accessible to kids (you get charged for just picking something up) and no kids' channels on TV.  The casino wasn't very impressive- no one was really hitting anything, there's not a great variety of machines, and good luck trying to get a drink! I could go on and on about all of my disappointments but lets just say that I will not be going back here.  I'm giving two stars for the few individuals that actually were trying to do their job well."
0,"I was not impressed. I have to agree with the 1 or 2 star review where someone said whoever is giving this place good ratings has not had real shabu shabu.\n\nThe place was plain. The first thing I noticed when we sat down was that they had condiment settings that are normally used for things like chili sauce filled with what looked like grated ginger or garlic, scallions, and onions. I said to my boyfriend that these could've been sitting out all day. I glanced at a table to the left of the bar and there were a bunch of these condiment sets sitting there, probably never used since they took 'em out of the fridge because no one comes here (it was pretty dead). Hmm.\n\nNext, I was looking at their menu and I was fairly disappointed. Everything just seemed to cost so much more than it should've. When the waitress came to take our order, my boyfriend told her what we wanted, but she turned to me and asked what I wanted. My boyfriend was like, \""We're going to share.\"" I started to wonder if the portions were supposed to be for each person. If so, then I felt like everything was overpriced. When we got the food, we were able to share it just fine (though my boyfriend ate most of it and I am hungry now, a few hours later). At the end of the meal, I still felt like we overpaid. Our meal was $23. If we hadn't split what the waitress implied was supposed to be a meal for a single person, then it would've been too much, imo. We just had hot pot at this great place in Rowland Heights, CA (called Kingswood Teppan Steak House, if you're ever in the area) and we had way more food and broth (two kinds, too) for $32. We had two different kinds of broth, four ingredients (chicken, beef, mushrooms, vegetables), and there was fried rice for each of us. Since it seems we split a single meal, we only got one bowl of white rice. The $9 difference would've only gotten us... I think probably just the side of chicken (it was like $6.95 or something) and we would have a couple bucks leftover that wouldn't have paid for anything else. I wasn't happy with the prices.\n\nAs I mentioned before, it was pretty dead when we got there. After finishing our meal and reading the reviews, I was not surprised. I've had hot pot before, but this is my first time having it in Las Vegas. I'm hoping better places exist. I may just have to start having hot pot at home when I get cravings.\n\nI can't recommend this place nor do I ever plan on coming back."
2,"I've seen Rock of Ages before and I LOVED it! It was amazing. I was singing and enjoying every moment. This show was good, but not as great as I remembered it the first time. I went to the show with my fiance and my parents. Although I remember there being some sexual references the first time, this show was a bit over the top. The costumes, the language, and the dancing was very Vegas. I HIGHLY recommend you leave the kids at home. It was a bit weird sitting with my parents through the show, but they just laughed it off. I don't think I'd pay $200/ticket for it, but it's an entertaining show."
3,"Although there are several good Indian restaurants in Madison, there are few to none where I actually want to sit down and enjoy a meal.  So I do take out.\n\nDhaba is the exception with its wide open windows and floor plan, and overall pleasing ambience.  Plus the food was excellent.\n\nThe veg samosa was perfectly cooked, and even reheated beautifully in the oven the next evening.  The crust is the tough part with samosas.  These were flaky with no toughness.\n\nThe lamb vindaloo was certainly lively, but not too spicy.  (I ordered it medium hot and it came that way--sort of 7 out of 10 on the heat scale.)  The lamb was sufficiently tender which is the first thing I look for in an Indian lamb dish.  I thought the sauce was a bit one-dimensional, but still satisfying.  Could use a side of raita.\n\nThe baingan bharta was the best I've had yet.  It had that beautiful mashed consistency with plenty of zing from the garlic, ginger and eggplant.\n\nThe chicken spinach dish featured plenty of skinless chicken thigh, almost too much in that I really love that curried Indian spinach sauce with just about anything.  So the chicken kind of dominated the dish.\n\nI ordered ginger naan which was sprinkled with cilantro and was both tasty and useful for sopping up the delicious sauces.\n\nCaution: Yelp had this place listed with a full bar, now corrected, which was wrong.  WIne and beer only.\n\nWe will be back when in that part of town.  The ambience and table settings are comfortable.  I won't have my sights set on a Beefeater martini now that I know.  I look forward to exploring more facets of Dhaba's reliable cuisine."
4,First - Big Guys in Mint Hill has great pizza. Really great pizza.  Wings also good here. Staff has always been very friendly. I've never eaten in but we get pizza/wings for take out all the time. It is slightly pricey when you get into adding lots of toppings but just cheese pizza is great. Really no complaints.  It's my choice of pizza places in the Mint Hill/Matthews area every time.
0,"I love Apple products but I hate their retail customer service. \nI've been here several times and it's always a nightmare. \nThe \""geniuses\"" aren't really that bright and they don't care about customer service. They would rather be talking to each other or checking out the eye candy. \n\nAll the employees are slow and have no sense of urgency."
3,"If this restaurant ever wanted to stand by itself on the strip, they would not have any problem bringing in business.  The waiters are very knowledgeable about the menu and all the dishes.  However, one shortfall was that their so-called sommelier suggested a wine that was much cheaper than the one we originally picked out.  Since our group was on vacation, we wanted to spend money.  Wine was only a fraction of our meal and the rest of it spoke for itself.  Many in the group ordered the filet mignon while I ordered the surf and turf.  Cooked to near perfection complimented by truffle fries and a bland mac n' cheese.  By the end of the night, we were stuffed and super happy.  Simply a great experience and will look forward to coming back next time!"
2,"I got married in the Platiumn Wedding Chapel on Saturday. The decor was beautiful. I upgraded my package to include the aisle runner, candles and the flowers for $250, but it was worth it. The chapel offered individual dressing rooms for the groom and bride. I think this is the only hotel out of the five we looked at had this accomodation. Walking to the Chapel from the room elevator is a good walk. So make sure you have your walking shoes with you. I had my Shape-up sketchers and then changed into my heels in the dressing room, otherwise my feet would have killed me before I walked down the aisle. The chapel is pretty hard to find, so make sure you tell your guests exactly where it is otherwise they will miss it. \n The Officiant and pianiast was very nice. I only have good things to say about them.\nI totally agree with the other Yelper, once the deposit is put down, the customer service just went down the drain. I actually have to keep on calling the coordinator back to ask for things and make corrections because she provided me with a contract that was outdated. I basically did all the leg work in planning the event out even though it was a package deal. I really don't see why a coordinator was needed. I think just to file papers. I had to make my own room reservations for the other nights and they don't have a way to link all the rooms, so I actually had to call the Front desk.\nI had to call Hospitality to order my cake, which was fine. I worked with Erik and he was extremely helpful. My cake turned out to be wonderful. It was way too big for 50 people, but everyone enjoyed it. \nI guess in my mind, a wedding coordinator is suppose to help with the entire wedding plans and not just filing papers or letting me know it is time for me to walk down the aisle.\nThe overall experience wasn't horrible. I guess I just expected more from the Coordinator."
1,"Save your money! I am dumbfounded that this show has received so many positive reviews. I previously attended the Cirque show 'O' at the Bellagio and that show - in contrast to this one - was outstanding! \n\nNo question the Ka theater and costumes at this show are amazing, however, both the 'acting' and quality of the performance were way below what I was anticipating given the other reviews and the reputation of the Cirque enterprise. Throw in chaotic, deafening head-banger music and you start to get an idea of why I am so critical of this show.\n\nI thought I scored a good deal on the tickets - $323 w/tax for 3 in really good seats near the front. Unfortunately, as the show wore on, I found myself dreaming about how many other ways I could have enjoyed spending that money elsewhere. To be fair, there were a few good sequences that were entertaining and well done... but those amounted to probably 10 minutes of the 1.5 hour performance. Many of the routines just left you wondering 'Huh? Why was that included??' For instance, at one point a performer does a solo twirling a baton... the first few seconds were ok, albeit a bit amateurish. However, after 3 or 4 minutes of watching her twirl the friggin baton you wished she would just topple off the stage or otherwise disappear.\n\nLikewise, there were a few martial art sequences that can only be described as lame. Keep in mind there are two performances of this show each night - this was the early show. Still, at times the performers looked completely exhausted throwing weak kicks and punches that truly looked like a bunch of pre-schoolers trying to play-fight as they re-enacted something they saw on TV! When routines like that fell so flat on the stage, I could only shake my head and roll my eyes with my companions doing the same thing next to me.\n\nThere was a family with three 6-8 year old kids sitting on booster seats next to us and those kids seemed to be enjoying the show. I guess if you are looking to entertain your kids for a few hours this show works. However, if you are expecting quality entertainment at an adult level and you are ok spending more than $100/ticket, do yourself a favor and check out another show."
2,"All you can eat Oyshi Sushi. \nIt was good. Good quality. Anything on the menu goes.\n\nBut all the rules! One desert per person. Eat most of the rice. Limited raw oysters. Limited hand rolls, and all you can eat ..in two hours. \n\nAll for around 25 dollar a person for dinner. \n\nI came for a bday dinner and we had a little room with dimmed lighting and trance music in the background. \nGood customer service too. \n\nIt's just a little too strict to really enjoy yourself and to enjoy the company you're dining with."
4,I just started going to this place and they are very nice and helpful.  I will be getting a hair cut and treatment done here soon and will review again after!
3,"The Vitamin Shoppe is a place I keep coming back to for supplements. I've shopped Sunflower, Whole Foods, and other places and while each has their niche when it comes to price and in some cases brands and even selection (exclusive items) The Vitamin Shoppe seems to have the edge. If you pull up Amazon on your smartphone and check prices, by the time you tack on shipping The Vitamin Shoppe has come out ahead for me. Plus by buying here vs. online I feel better knowing I'm helping to keep local people working. But all that feel good stuff aside, they usually have what I want. Tribulus? 5 different bottles and that's just what you see first. Kava Kava? Yep, they got it. Various vitamin supplements including iron free stuff for men? Yep. From TwinLab to a very good in house brand, if you take supplements this should be on your list of places to check out. They also offer additional specials and online offers to save money but that's outside this review. When you walk in the store is clean. and while it's lightly staffed if you're patient you'll be able to get knowledgeable help. My patience limit is kinda short but I've never walked out of here peeved over service. Parking and access is easy as long as Sunset is not jammed with traffic, and after shopping there's a great Rubio's 2 doors down."
3,"Came and stayed here at the last minute when our plans to stay at a friend's house fell through. Since we were planning on driving down the 215 to pass through the Hoover Dam on to the Grand Canyon the next day, we were between this place and the Tropicana. Walked into the Trop and the line to check in was practically out the door, so we hopped back in the car and drove to this place. $48 for a non-smoking double bed room at 2 am on a Thursday night? With no notice? Score! I'm sure the room would have been cheaper by booking online in advance, but at what they offered it to us for? We'll take it!\n\nThe room was very clean, but the view was DISMAL-- of a service area with a cherry picker and a golf cart-- but what can you expect from an off-Strip hotel and casino with only 4 stories of hotel rooms? The bathroom offered Bath & Body Works soaps, which was nice, and the stay was nice as well, although housekeeping tried to come in at like 8 am. Seriously?\n\nIf I need a last minute room in Vegas ever again, I'll definitely try this place out."
1,"HORRIBLE service on the patio and over priced cocktails!!! The waitress flat out ignored us, even when we signaled to her. When she did wait on us she would walk away in the middle of our order! And then it would take forever to get the order we placed. In addition to the slow and rude service, we were asked to change tables for a reservation that arrived early- even though they neglected to place a reserved sign on the table we had chosen. This was after the nice umbrellas providing shade on the patio were taken down and we were all left in the sun. The new table we had to move to was even more directly in the sun and we had to find our own umbrella. This place has potential but they are lacking in customer service."
1,"Went there on a weekday for dinner with people I work with  - music was so loud could hardly talk. This is not a nightclub but with the music blaring you  alomosty thought you were in one  if you closed our eyes.  Pizza was good...more \""designer pizzas\"" than a good old pizza place - okay if you don't mind paying for an over-priced pizza.  Did not care for the chicken wings. Not sure what the fuss is about this place."
2,"Howzit!?\n\nThis is arguably the best noodle house in Las Vegas. \n\nBest dumplings (or 'Water Dog' as my sister in law calls it. From Cantonese pronunciation) in town and surpass many restaurants in Los Angeles.\n\nTry the 'Minute Chicken Cake Noodle', Garlic pan fried chicken on grilled noodle cake pieces. Very flavorful.\n\nThe rest of the items are average. Very good quality consider Las Vegas is not known for good Chinese food.. Very good service, courteous and helpful waitresses, an unusual attribute in Chinese restaurants.\n\nI visit them on every trip to Las Vegas."
4,"You know those places where you can go to just kick it and hang with your goofy friends and chat with the staff? This is one if those places. You can come as you are, the nerdier the better! Let your inner otaku out while you eat some amazing dishes.\nThe decor is simple and bright, very inviting and you're always welcomed with a smile. The food is cooked to order so it comes out piping hot. You can choose from different bases and then add as many toppings as you like. Get crazy with it! We won't judge you. Oh, and you can choose your spice level so you can sweat out all those toxins or stay calm and collected while you devour the deliciousness. \nAnd just a side note, this is Japanese curry, not the overwhelmingly fragrant Indian curry. So if you were worried about any type of strong smell don't worry. You can still kiss that hot crush of yours with no issues!"
3,They have really good subs. I suggest eating them there. They are better warm. The only problem I have right now with them is that they are so busy they have run out of soda cup lids and some of the different sodas that they offer. They are pretty clean considering that they are so busy. Friendly staff will fix problems pretty quickly.
4,"Very good food and very nice and prompt service. We ordered the Curry Squash with tofu, one of their soups, Moak Gai, and one of their fried rice dishes. We didn't really care for the Moak Gai as it didn't seem to have much flavor. The soup and fried rice where very good and worth ordering again, but it was the Curry Squash that left us wanting more. What a great little place. Note this place is not large, but they seem to handle it very well."
4,"My a/c on my 08 Honda wasn't working all the time just sometimes when it wasnt hot. Took it to Honda and they wanted $105 just to look at it. They said parts and labor would be extra if they found out what was wrong. Took it to Jack and Sons, he asked a few questions turns out it was the motor blower and I was out the door an hour later for just a little more than what Honda would have charged just to look at it. Thanks Jack and Sons."
3,"I recent stayed at the Signature for a bachelorette party. We had 2 deluxe suite rooms right next to eachother some 20+ floors up. We got this amazing deal on gilt jetsetter and paid like $150 a night for 2 nights on a fri / sat including taxes. I didn't spend a ton of time in the room but I was sober when i arrived so i do remember it. I actually really liked it and will likely stay there next time. We also got free wet republic tickets as part of our package so that helped too\n\nPlus-\n-Layout of the room is spacious and they set up furniture well to maximize the 550 sq ft\n-King bed with nice linens, we fit three comfortably (women)\n-Pull out couch. less comfy but not as bad as you'd imagine, two can fit\n-Whirlpool spa tub is pretty big, i would know bc i slept in it (not on purpose obviously). I didn't wake up the next day with any pain so if you also are too drunk to make it to the bed, not to worry the Jacuzzi awaits\n-View was nice, we could see a good portion of the strip\n-Kitchen has a coffee maker, blender (Helpful!), fridge, utensils and kitchenette, plenty of glasses (also necessary). Basically everything to make drinks and save yourself with coffee and toast the next morning\n-The bathroom has two sinks and the toilet in a separate door so for the women who all pile into the bathroom there is another mirror by the door so 4 of you can get ready at once (enough outlets as well)\n-Pretty quiet overall compared to the rest of the strip which was nice\n-Everything was very clean and looked new which is surprising given the amount of partying that goes on\n\nThe only thing i really didn't like about this place is that it is a bit of a hike to the main MGM hotel or to the strip. We got cabs pretty quickly bc they do come around but a relatively hefty fare to get to the other side of the strip for 10 people. Also cafe in the lobby not that great."
1,"Can we all agree that the absolute most annoying thing is bad service?!? I had the strangest experience at Daily Dose. I read the review in the Arizona Republic about the amazing omelette's, pancakes, and overall atmosphere so I was dieing to try it! \n\nThe atmosphere is very lounge-like and completely different than most Breakfast hot spots. The owner was very friendly and sat us right away- the table happen to be next to her baby asleep on the booth bench next to me. You know when you are sitting so close to two other tables that it's hard to even hold conversation?? \n\nWe ordered- I asked for the Prime Rib Omelet and my boyfriend got the Caprese Omelet. Our server (there were only two for the entire restaurant) messed up the order but nonetheless, I felt the food was lacking overall flavor- basic things like Salt and Pepper! Don't be fooled- the food looks amazing! But back to the \""experience....\"" \n\nAs the owner brings us our food, she was sure to point out \""tell all of your friends that this is a great place to drink!\"" And brought us a drink menu filled with Happy Hour specials and things like \""Join us for NFL Sundays.\"" So the loungy  atmosphere, with NFL Sundays and Drink Specials, leads me to ask... what exactly is this place?!? In Old Town Scottsdale, with so many Breakfast restaurants, or bars, or sports bars, you need to stand out- pick what type of place you're going to be, and go with it! \n\nThey most annoying part of our Breakfast was that good friends of the owner and server were seated at the table next to us- while the two payed more than enough attention to that tables needs for drinks/paying the check, I sat there for a good 15 minutes with out Coffee or Water and a messed up order! It doesn't end there, another couple walks in the front door, and the owner is in the middle of bottle feeding her baby, so baby in tow, she seats the couple.... does anyone else think that's weird?!? \n\nIronically enough, as we're sitting there, empty cups, check ready to be paid, Channel 3 TV comes in to film the great place- I couldn't help but tell my boyfriend how unsatisfying the experience was as the camera man panned across our table."

I think they got a little to creative.  The potato salad is still good though.\n\nAnother feature I enjoy is there seasonal specials, like the watermelon and jalape\u00f1o dish."
1,"I did a review on KOMP a few months ago & it was deleted/censored for ????\n\nIn anycase, Its what I have my home stereo tuned to for the lack of nothing better when I'm not listening to my prefered cd's = Straight up Metal = Exodus, Overkill, Megadeth, Metallica, Motorhead, Sabbath, Preist etc. You get the idea.....\n\nMy major complaint about KOMP is that they will play, For example: Iron Maiden's \""Number of the Beast\"" OR DIO \""Rainbow in the Dark\"" totally rocking out & blowing my mind that they actually play something cool like this. And the next song will be some \""EMO\"" they are passing off as \""Rock/Metal\"" I dont get it at all.\n\nMy latest gripe is that 5 Finger Death Punch song \""I Remember\"" where the dude is crying about his daddy or something. THAT is what passes for ROCK theses days? Sorry but I cant turn that off fast enough and THAT goes for ALOT of other stuff they play too & THATS why I have cd's = Crank it!! \\m/"
0,"terrible service!  the only advantage of this liquor store is it's close to the strip.  I went there to buy some liquor on a friday night and after I left the store, I couldn't find my phone.  So I called my cellphone to see if it's somewhere in my car.  The phone wasn't shut off and it wasn't in my car.  So I decided to call back the liquor store.  the person said they didn't find any phone.  Then I asked if I can come back and check myself.  The person said sure but insisted they didn't find my phone there.  However, when I called my phone again right after I told them I was coming back to check, it was shut off.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or they were scared of my phone might ring when I come back to check and call it again.  And just to be fair to them, I clearly remembered talking on the phone with one of my friends before heading over to the liquor store.  So the chance that I lost my phone in the liquor store is very highly! On top of that, the liquor is ghetto as hell and doesn't have plastic cup for customers.  What kinda of a liquor store is it if it doesn't even have cups?\nDon't go there if you don't want to lose your phone !"
0,"Where to begin? Hmm. Went here with a large group of friends to watch the ASU vs. UofA game for the territorial cup. We were there for about 4 hours total, and for the first hour and 15 minutes we got to speak to our waitress exactly once. She took our initial drink order, delivered some beverages and then disappeared like a magician's assistant. When we managed to draw her attention after that obscenely long period of time to order food it took over half an hour to get anything. This included an order of chips and salsa - something which is prepared by putting chips in a basket and pouring salsa into a bowl. When the food was delivered, it came out unaccompanied by the cocktails we had ordered. When we remarked on this, we were told the bar had run out of glasses and we would get our drinks as soon as they were cleaned. Our drinks were eventually delivered a while later and we managed to enjoy the game for a little while. During the game we had a few different waitresses come up to us to deliver a bowl of soup we hadn't ordered, a beer we hadn't ordered, three orders of chips and salsa we hadn't ordered (presumably to make up for the fact that the first order had taken almost 40 minutes to get to our table), and two rum and cokes we didn't order. Upon learning that these cocktails weren't ours, the waitress who brought them decided to leave them sitting on the hostess stand which was near our table. A little bit later, one of my friends decided to order 4 \""Belfast Booms\"" which is the Tilted Kilt's version of an Irish Car Bomb. These were delivered as follows - the waitress first brought out 4 shots of Bailey's Irish Cream with no whiskey mixed in. The shots came out in two glass shot glasses, one plastic disposable shot glass, and one cocktail glass with an inch of Irish cream sitting in the bottom. She then said she would be right back.  We assumed she was going back to get the glasses of Guinness the shots are supposed to be mixed with but apparently she didn't know that's how the drink is served because she didn't come back for about 15 minutes with the beers. The beer glasses (per the description on the menu) were supposed to have a half pint of Guinness to drop the shots in. They actually came out with quite a bit less - a level low enough that dropping the shot glasses into the beer would have left the level of beer below the top of the shot glass. What was even more amusingly odd was the one drink served with the plastic shot glass - as an experiment we dropped the shot into the Guinness in and confirmed what we thought would happen - the plastic shot glass did not fall into the beer, it floated on top of the foam head. By the end of the evening, we got to the point where we were just amused by the utter incompetence and complete indifference we saw in every aspect of the service we received. I personally was confused by the fact that our waitress did not seem at all interested in serving a table that had close to 20 customers - why would you not try to give good service to such a large group that would (presumably) be the source of a large tip?  My portion of the bill was over $40, so if you do the math, she was risking 15-20% of a roughly $700-$800+ bill. My confusion was alleviated when we received our bills and found that while we were being billed individually, the restaurant treated the bills as if they were for a single large bill and automatically added the gratuity (18%) to the total.  It's really a shame because the food was pretty good, but not good enough to entice me to ever return there again."
1,"Updating for the vegan perspective: I asked the staff & owner if their bread contained any animal products. He had no idea, but he did try to call his bread supplier (Capistrano's bakery) to find out for me. Unfortunately, they couldn't tell him at the time, so I asked him for the phone number (480-968-0468).\n\nI followed up with a phone call to the bakery another day and they informed me that they use whey (an animal protein) in all of their wheat & white breads. Their sourdough bread has no animal ingredients, so vegans eating a sandwich here should opt for the sourdough bread.\n\nRecommendation to Capt-N Bill: Add a vegan sub option to your menu."
3,"I was visiting Vegas with my Dad and sister and brother.  For my Dad and sister, it was their first time in Vegas and my brother and I wanted to take them to a Vegas show.\n\nI had booked suites at the Bellagio and thought that logistically it would be best if we saw something there.  Cirque du Soleil O was an easy choice.  I've seen Cirque's Ka and Zumanity before so I knew they would enjoy it.\n\nThe venue is quite large.  We got mid-range seats since I wasn't quite sure they wanted to see it.  (It was more my idea then theirs)  The venue is quite large and from what I understand some of the less expensive seats have obstructed views.  The show is has a water theme so the the front few rows are in a splash zone.\n\nThe show is very good.  As always the acrobatics are amazing and the stage transforms from a dry surface to a large pool several time throughout the show.  The show is about 2 hours.  I got the tickets online.  Be prepared to wait in a bit of line to pick up your tickets a will call so plan ahead.\n\nAll in all, a great show to see in Vegas although I'd probably recommend seeing it on your first night because I don't care how good the show is,  the 24 hour party in Vegas and lack of sleep will probably have you falling asleep as soon as the lights go down.\n\nStay sexy fellow Yelpers!"
2,"I visited on New Year's Day hoping to find the traditional sauerkraut and sausage my parents used to make to start the new year. I did check out the Yelp reviews first and noted two restaurants in the same parking lot. I had a coupon for the other one, but discovered it was closed. The read the reviews for Bavarian Point and initially was hesitant. The overall star rating was slightly above average, but upon further review most of the very good reviews were old. The reviews from the past two years were poor-low, but I risked it and went inside. \n\nOne of the negative comments from other reviews stated the service was slow. It took a lot of time to be greeted and there wasn't a sign saying \""please seat yourself\"". Both of these appear to have been addressed as there was a sign, I picked a table, and was immediately helped by what I presumed was the owner. It wasn't very busy when I arrived - only one table of three older ladies. As I stayed for my meal a few more small groups arrived.\n\nI ordered the Wurst Pfanne - which was exactly what I was looking for (only more of it): polish sausage, Bratwurst, and Weisswurst served with sauerkraut and fried potatoes. The meal also came with my choice of salad bar or noodle & vegetable soup. I went with the soup and ordered a Spatan Dunkel to wash it all down.  The soup arrived quickly as did a free order of bread. \n\nWhen the food arrived it was a large portion, garnished with Alf alpha sprouts, tomato, and a side of spicy mustard. For $15.95 it was more than I would typically spend on a lunch, but there was plenty of food to bring home. The beer was $5 and even though I didn't eat half of my meal I went for dessert too (another $5.50). They have apple strudel, but I went with cake. German chocolate is my favorite, but the server talked me into Black Forest. She said she liked German chocolate, but after having Black Forest she hasn't returned. This was good, but afterwards I would probably stick with German chocolate. \n\nOverall the experience was good - the service was efficient, there restaurant had a nice appearance, and the food was excellent. I would probably give it another try."

1,"Our dd took a few classes like Apples to zebras & Bldg Blk over the past few months. It has been a great experience not until lately. She came home complained about one of the boy bullying her - physically punching her. It wasn't once and twice, it was in several occasions.\n\nWe went to alert one of the main 'instructor' - she said it has never happened before?!  While our dd was literally crying when we told the instructor because she was so scared that after letting them know, that boy will 'beat her up' even worse.\n\nIn various occasions, we went to picked her up and we noticed that the younger instructors were standing around, chit chatting and not paying attention to the kids. It was a BIG class, 16-18 kids in a room with maybe 4 or so instructors (whenever they can get them in)\n\nMind you, they are only \""instructors\"" because they are staff for the City of Chandler, NOT 'qualified pre-school trained' teachers having any kind of certification - at least not ALL of them. We learnt that one of the staff working there was asked to stand-in once in awhile when they are understaffed. That's why their fees are really affordable.\n\nWe coached our daughter as we understand that we as parents need to take responsibility in coaching her how to deal with such bullies, however, we also need to alert anyone out there who still want to send their kids in to be aware that the instructors need to be better trained in this aspect."
3,The sample cone for Italian ice are perfect size. If you have a little one. Under three years old.  Bam!!
4,"AWESOME LAS VEGAS! Man do there employees work there asses off! I had god knows what I can't remember, but the scenary hellow right outside the L.V sign. nice trees, plus you see people taking pics on the sign. It's crowded, but the atmosphere is up in arms. Just tuff to get a place to sit. and there is a mall across the street so yup. The taste was so off the hook!"
4,"Design & Wine's new location in Henderson is the bomb!!  Same great service, same outstanding staff and same delicious food that they've spoiled us with at their Las Vegas location!  So glad I now have two Design & Wine locations to choose from! I will continue TO GET MY PAINT ON at this fabulous place!!"
3,"They have solid pizza. It is NY Style, which I prefer, and the selection of toppings is good. I had sausage and cheese and it was good. Not too greasy and the crust is excellent. I would recommend as it is a good pizza and prices are really low. A great spot for all this students across the street (who I suspect dont realize its there). \n\nI will head back in there and order some whole pizzas to try out the full spectrum of toppings I am able to jam onto a pie. Until next time."
4,I've had a lot of people tell me to go here and I finally saw what all the rage was about. The lamb and mint was delicious. I will definitely be going back.
1,"We ate at Bouchon this evening and I had what I usually have, Steak Frites. Perhaps there's a new chef there, but I was remarkably disappointed: the food was little better than mediocre. Below is my earlier review, written after many dinners there. Mr. Keller, I am disappointed in what's happened to what used to be one of my favorite restaurants here in Las Vegas.\n\n\""Okay, this is our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. First, the food's just grand, though the service can be a little slow at times, but the food's great so who cares. \n\n\""Moreover, it's reasonably priced for a venue of this calibre. My wife and I have always gotten out of there for under $100. The caveat here is that we don't drink there.\n\n\""One of these days we're going to try it for brunch, though it's a tough reservation, or used to be.\"""
0,"Worst car rental experience ever. Arrived in Phoenix after booking a car 3 months earlier, I had a late flight, landed at 11:30\nand was told they had no cars on the lot. Do Not Book Here."
3,"Good food, atmosphere and neighborhood gatherings.  Coffee is expensive. Love the Story Slam!"
1,"been a fan favorite of the Nugget for years but this trip convinced me to spend my money elsewhere next time we hit Vegas. this place has pulled the purse strings so tight that I am sure if they could figure out a way to charge you for the elevator and they would and probably a front door charge as wedll, they push the no resort fee because they are downtown but believe me they make up for it everywhere else, valet staff were happy and friendly other than that good luck, grouchy almost bitchy front desk people with rotten attitude, maybe they forgot the rule about the customer is there paycheck, do not take the upgrades to jr suites pretty much all you get is a hallway and if your in the rush tower stay off the fremont side unless you want to hear really bad rock and roll bouncing off your rooom walls untill 2 am and trash cans being hit hard by the garbage truck at 6 am in the alley next door and its Saturday WOW! after this being my hotel of choice since the 80's got to find another one. and in agreement with the guy below me in this review good luck getting a chair at the pool since they are saving every cahir in site and you never see anyone sit down my advice is if someone says they are saving seats take it anyway and let security get involved maybe they will be better than the rest of their staff this place rolled downhill in a hurry"
4,Sweet Cakes is such a fun and awesome place to eat! Love their lunches and the 5 layer brownie is to die for! The service is great and since its a family owned place I feel comfortable bringing my family there as well. They are CASH ONLY but they take cards on big orders if you ask and they do take checks.
0,The food came really late and when it finally arrived it was cold. Terrible customer service.
4,LOVE Dyer's and go there whenever I'm in the area for a fix of the caramel and cheese mix. But Carlton keeps adding other flavors so now I'm going to have to branch out...it's good I bought the jumbo container to refill...
2,"This is for the shaved ice.\n\nIt is good, decent, but not fabulous\n\nreasons it is great: 1- there is NO other place in Pittsburgh, PA to have this and 2- it is not just ice ice it is SNOW ice meaning they use milk as their base and it tastes beyond fabulous. I would only bicker to say that they should let us choose what we want on the ice. I wanted the strawberry, but I also wanted the red bean, but i could NOT get both just choosing from their options. \n\nI would go here because being from California - the land of everything basically and the best foods - shaved ice is a must in LA/SF. So here is something that would feed my cravings."
4,I love Dr. J!!! He's been our Family Care Physician for almost a decade now and have recommended him to family and friends. He always takes time to every health issues and concerns which I believe is his #1 trait that is why he has a steady flow of patients. I hate doctors who asked you to wait forever and then see you for only 5 minutes without even explaining what's the actual cause of your concern. More power to Dr. J and his wonderful staff!!!
4,"don't be put off by the location in an ugly industrial park.  inside the restaurant is very nice and we really enjoyed the food.\n\ni had one of the skillets and it was quite tasty.  i would definitely come back, and recommend it to anyone looking for breakfast in northeast phoenix area."
4,"I haven't been to the new ARIA yet, but Encore is by far the best casino on the strip.  It is classy looking, clean, and the watiresses come by often to serve you.  They are faster with the drinks than any other casino I've been to in Vegas.  They also have a lot more slot machines here than anywhere else.  The restaurants are better.  And the overall feel of the casino is just so \""vegas\"".  It gives the high end vegas feeling, not the low brow ghetto vegas feeling.  I would spend the money and stay here.  The club at Wynn is phenominal, check it out if you don't want to go to the newest Vegas hotspot.  \n\nDerek"
3,"We went for a Monday night happy hour just to check the place out without hoards of people around.  It's a beautiful set-up - classy, comfortable furniture, pool with cabanas for rent as well as plenty of free seating with lounge chairs and pool tables inside.  We had 3 appetizers and loved them all (shrimp ceviche, carnitas tacos and chicken quesadilla) - quality and quantity were great for happy hour food.  Drinks were just ok - they were 2 for 1 and filled up to the rim with ice.  \n\nIt's built as a party place for sure, but early in the week could be a nice atmosphere to relax poolside during Happy Hour!"
0,"We went for the lunch buffet as my oldest son has been begging to go. It was a mad house!  There was no ice for fountain drinks, no forks, no breadsticks, hardly any pizza to choose from (due to them not keeping up with the demand), and only 1 salad to choose from. I saw many 'questionable' people loading up their plates--like 8 slices on one plate. It was so busy that they didn't even have proper plates. We ate on cheap paper plates!  We stood in line for over 10 minutes to get through the buffet line. I was still hungry after my one slice of pizza and handful of salad, but didn't want to go wait in the line again, as it was even longer. I guess it's a good diet plan."
2,"Considering that all the other dining establishments inside the Wynn wouldn't let my friends in (due to the fact they were wearing Tank tops and Shorts, it's Vegas! .. not everyone is here to dress up)\n\nWe dropped by Zoozacrackers Deli to grab a \""light\"" dinner due to their earlier partying. The lady at the counter was very nice and suggested options and explained the menu. I ordered my fave French fries because you can't really screw it up. My friends ordered soups, jalapeno poppers and of course beers ($7-8)\n\nI didn't try the soups, but my fries were good with a delectable crunch."
4,Eldon is the man!  He knows how to get the job done the right way and is honest when he does it.  It's nice to be able to trust someone with a business and who is willing to go the extra mile to take care of you!  \nDid you know they just started doing yard maintenance?\nCheck out Landscape Doctors!
2,"Just your average subway minus the girl behind the counter was not the sharpest, she was nice though"
0,"So looking forward to this dining experience last evening...had been recommended by several folks in person and the reviews on Yelp only pumped up my taste buds more...\n\nIf this is Las Vegas Mexican food at it's best then someone needs to have their head examined....it was downright BLAH.\n\nChips and salsa up front was nice touch but Salsa nothing special. Beans were nice free touch too but tasted like straight out of a can. We had several palate's to please. picky 15 year old, 18 year old who loves fish and anything fresh, your texmex appetite and mine who embraces any different, fresh or just darn good food.\n\nHow can you mess up a plain chicken quesadilla... two bites and 15 year old  was done...tasted it and couldn't agree more. Shrimp enchilada sounds good and as there was so much shrimp on the menu you figured it was a easy home run. Chewy and fishy covered in a plain sauce...18 year old didn't get through a 1/4 of it and others at the table agreed. Chicken Enchilada, come on how easy is that...apparently not to easy! Barely passable and again just plain. I had the 3 pork chops, Chuletas was the dish name, marinated overnight in a secret sauce. Don't bother, chops dried out and the sauces only secret is that it smothered the pork chops in something I would only describe as tasteless.\n\nThe service here was excellent (besides 3 requests for water) and can't fault them in this regard. Almost all the people in their, both small and large parties seemed to be celebrating a birthday party and it was just way to loud. WARNING sign - they listed fish on the menu but all they had were shrimp. This leads me to believe they do not shop fresh produce, how can you not have fish tacos on the menu!!! Come on and yes this only dawned on me after.\n\nWe finished our meal and probably returned the food about 75 - 80% untouched. There was an apology from the waiter but no manager to come and ask why, no credit on the bill... NOTHING.\n\nWe left our tip and were out of there and likely to never return...$100 down the drain.\n\nI am rarely this bad when writing reviews but when you have options like Mundos in town and Don Juan for texmex/fresh food then I would recommend you steering clear of this over rated Mexican establishment.\n\nSorry Lindo..."
0,"I've given up and Pittsburgh barbeque, and was loathe to try Mr. Willie's.  How bad can it be, I asked.\n\nBad.\n\nOrdered the 16 piece barbeque chicken meal with three sides and cornbread.  The chicken was not grilled, or heaven forbid, actually smoked.  It was basic baked chicken, doused in barbecue sauce.   Not barbeque by a long shot.\n\nThe sides were awe-inspiring in their awfulness. Red beans and rice was simultaneously hot and bland, made with perhaps ketchup and hot sauce.  No celery, onions or peppers or thyme.  Like a rice-a-roni version of red beans and rice.\n\nThe greens were mixed kale and collards, and not inedible.  Bizarrely, the meat used in the greens was corned beef.  Traditionally, soul food greens include ham hocks or smoked turkey to give it that great musky, funky taste.  But corned beef seems to be some awkward concession to its Squirrel Hill location.  \n\nCornbread?  A hand wrapped two by two inch square of crumbly corn-bread in wax paper.  Looked inedible, and in fact was.\n\nService?  Awful.  Apparently the lukewarm write-ups from Munch and City Paper inspired him to try to increase business by grunting subaudibly to his customers.  Woo-hoo!  \n\nPrediction: the location turns into a kosher restaurant by March of 2009. And it's a shame.  Except in home kitchens, soul food is dead in Pittsburgh."
1,"As soon as you get off the plane, the sound of slot machines warmly welcome you to the City of Sin where all bets are off, no rules, all fun.  Welcome to the place where an adult can be a kid.  Make your way through the glitzy airport, grab your bags, and do... whatever you please in Las Vegas.  The city is your oyster!\n\nBut when you head back to catch your flight back home (most likely broke) make sure you keep your eyes away from the slots to avoid being tempted to spend your last $1 on a broken dream.  \n\nIMHO, they could really do a nice renovation of Terminal 2... Us Hawaiians need some snazzy, impressive displays of Vegas glam, too!  Just sayin'..."
0,"What a waste of money. The portions are so small. I understand it's supposed to be like tapas, but $8.88 for a pork sandwich the circumference of a tennis ball? Really?? I wasn't impressed by this place. We ordered a few dishes per person and weren't really happy with any of them. Also it took them half an hour to fill our waters. \n\nThe only plus was the nice GM that came by to check on us. \n\nJust head to Spring Mountain and eat something legit and delish for the same price of one of these dishes AND be full."
1,"I don't think I could ever give an airport restaurant more than 3 stars, so consider this rating middle-of-the road as far as airport restaurants go. The service is SUPER fast and friendly - I think I waited less than 5 minutes for my burger to arrive. On that note, it tasted like it took less than 5 minutes to make. My salad also tasted like the plastic bag it came from. But the ladies behind the counter were very accommodating and made sure I had everything I needed. Can't comment on the drinks (I thought 11am on a Thursday may have been pushing it). But next time I am at the airport, I will probably try a different restaurant out before resorting to this place."
4,"Located in a great complex, Archi's is both convenient and offers great service. I have never had an issue with food or staff, and if frequent this dining establishment quite often. Although it's surrounding include highly competitive eateries, nothing compares to Archi's simple yet delicious Thai Dishes. Without a doubt, the Shrimp Pad Thai (spicy level 5) is my favorite Thai dish in town. Try it and you won't be disappointed"
3,"I have eaten here quite a few times but after a long busy summer finally getting to write a review!  This is for the night time menu.\n\nIf you want authentic cantonese food this is the spot.  Me being the seasoned white girl in any asian situation, I was intimidated but went forth.  As I looked around I saw more and more ethnicities.  This is authentic Chinese food and service, if you want the nice smiling waitress at your beck and call don't come here but if you want great food fast service and hold your glass up for water you go t the right place!  I have been to China and if they are to nice you usually leave because that means the food sucks!  Oxymoron in that one huh?!\n\nSo the food is great and in large portions the menu is easy to maneuver with pictures and descriptions.  The menu is expansive so I will not waste your time I do however suggest the seasonal veggie no matter what it is, it is always a winner!  They also have the really hard to maneuver menu if you would like to try.  Everything on it is hard core Cantonese and even my father inlaw couldn't remember some... LOL \n\nHighly recommend, if you haven't been just study the menu for a bit let it speak to you.  I think you will be happy :)"
1,"The service is ok but the food was terrible! I had eggs benedict and I was greatly disappointed! The hollandaise sauce was nasty, the ham was cold and the english muffin was cold as well. The potatoes aren't seasoned and instead of cooking the onions with the potatoes, it looks like they just sprinkled the onions on top! The only reason I gave it two stars is because the apple juice and coffee were both good!!"
4,We absolutely love this place! We went there several times during our stay in Las Vegas and it was great every time. The server was really nice and attentive and the food is awesome. Try the Blueberry Pancakes!! We can definitely recommend this diner.
0,"Came back after two weeks because I still was sick.  The registration staff was still just as nice and helpful.    Although there was no line, I saw the doctor for approximately 90 seconds.  He said you're back; I told him what was going wrong and he told me his plan and left.    I doubt my co pay and health insurance appreciated such a pathetic effort.  \n\n\nI won't be coming back, there are other places where I'll be seen and treated for a bit longer."
3,"This is my go-to for snacks and light bites when I'm at the Westin or Ellis Island.  It's a little tucked back from the street, but always busy when I go there.\n\nI get the sandwiches (I know, I know - yuk and unhealthy, but they are filling) and bottles of water. The workers are friendly and usually milling about, restocking or cleaning up."
3,Who doesn't love M&M's? I always stop by here when I am in town to get my cute souvenirs. I love the green M&M!
4,The Supreme pizza is delicious!!! This place is a hidden gem! Can't wait to come back and try their other specialty pizzas.
3,"I wandered into the farmers market with a couple of friends and we had a great experience.  We picked up red chard, mixed greens, apple butter, candied ginger, and a few other things.  on the way out the even hooked us up with a bag of fresh rosemary on the house!\n\nIf you are in the area on saturdays, check it out!"
0,"The vast chasm between the 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews of this place is very interesting... but my one and only experience with this place is ZERO stars. \nI ordered sushi for delivery, and it arrived quickly, but the order was made incorrectly-- didn't even come close to matching the menu description. No avocado, no green onion, AND no cucumber in the roll, and the wrong sauce. This was an expensive fancy roll with only 2 of the 5 listed things inside and a massive amount of rice to make it look big. I immediately called the restaurant to let them know, and the \""owner\"" (she insisted she was the owner) spent 11 minutes telling me \""that's just how we make it now\"" ... I explained that the roll was far from matching the menu description, didn't contain the full value of ingredients I had paid for, and that this situation needed to be fixed. She literally just kept saying \""that's how we make it now\"" and for a while tried the tactic of telling me that there WAS avocado on it, I just couldn't see it bc it was such a small slice.... yeah... there was not avocado anywhere in or on the roll. I repeatedly asked to speak to a manager or supervisor but she said she was the owner. So then I asked for her name and she straight-up refused to give me her name, numerous times. I finally realized I was arguing with an actual insane person, so I gave up. If you're ever thinking of ordering from here, just throw $15 into the trash instead."
4,"This place is great! Authentic banh mi, pho, and all other Vietnamese specialties!\nThey have a few generic Chinese dishes but if you want a winner stick with the Vietnamese! \n\nBbq pork in or on anything its amazing, on the banh mi, or in rice best i have ever had. Great bread on the sandwich, crusty outside, super soft & fresh inside. \n\nEvery ingredient used looked and tasted amazing and could not be more fresh! \nAlready planning what i want on my next visit! Can't wait!"
4,"5 stars for customer service. This is our go-to place for Chinese take-out after having tried a bunch of places in our area. The food is consistent, standard Chinese-American, always hot, with fresh veggies. \n\nTonight, though, I was prompted to write a review. I am vegetarian and my husband is a little picky, and as such I made asked for some substitutions to our order. I ordered Mooshoo vegetable with no egg (my preferece) and veggie fried rice with added tofu and no mushrooms (hubbie's preference after finding a rogue mushroom last time). Also ordered a few other items.\n\n5 minutes later, China Village called back to double-check that I also didn't want egg in the fried rice since I had asked for it in the mooshoo. I thanked him for asking, and no, we did not want any egg in the rice. \n\nI went to pick up the order, and the sweet little lady at the counter told me that that also made sure to take the mushrooms out of our soup, since she was worried that we couldn't eat mushrooms and didn't want us to worry about finding them. \n\nThey did not have to pay such close attention to details, and I wouldn't have complained if none of these things had occurred. But because they went the extra mile, my appreciation was far greater than my dissatisfaction would have been. \n\nSupport this place and show them that customer service still means something!"
1,I know this place gets great reviews but I've got to say my experience was not so great. \n\nFirst we signed up for some puppy training classes and after being delayed three times (the first time we weren't even told and drove 30 minutes to find out) We finally asked for our deposit back. \n\nNext we boarded our pup last minute - which was cool - but when we got him back a few days later he smelled terrible (like urine) and ended up with worms AND kennel cough. He was miserable for almost three weeks afterwards. It took $200 in vet bills and $120 in medicines to get him feeling well again. Of course timing couldn't be worse as we had a new baby at home. \n\nI think we'll try and find someone to come to our house next time we need a puppy-sitter.
0,"I needed to rent a car and I called a cab company to drop me off, I am handicapped and asked the cab driver to drop me off close to the door entrance, he did when a employee of Fox yelled at him and told him you can't stop there nd get he hell out and go to the other entrance 200 plus yards away. My  driver explained my disabled feature and the fox  employee yelled he didn't care and he would give the cab driver a ticket if he let me out. I told the driver take me to enterprise and told the fox employee he lost a customer for life"
0,"I have given this place 3 or 4 chances and each time it has gotten worse.\n\nMy last visit the server was not very attentive. \n\nWhen we went to go get the ingredients, the area where they had the meats and veggies. Was so disgustingly dirty like food everywhere and all messy. Some things not fully refilled. So gross. But we still gave it another chance. The food was just ok pretty sure it made us kind of sick afterwards. \n\nDo not come here it's disgusting"
1,"Eh overall.  I usually love the yeardhouse, but this did not quite do it for me. Started out with the hummus, which was a little tasteless and the pita was very chewy.  Next we got the margarita pizza, when really was under par.  Tasted very dry and bland.  No real flavor.  Overall was disappointed with the food.  Add 1 star for the great beer selection.  Not sure if I would go back here."
4,"Love Frank & Lupes.  Moved here from Cali and have been on the quest for good Mexican food.  This place is the best that I've found so far.  Very tasty!  Love the outdoor patio, although the service there is slow, but the ambience is great!"
0,"Menu has not changed since their opening and it is not appetizing to see such a small number of choices that's been here for a long time. Only thing has changed is the quality of service to negative direction. During a whole dinner, our waiter showed up once with desert menu. With the ambience of this restaurant, there should be definite protocols each waiter should follow. I can't see myself coming back to honey salt anymore."
1,"My wife and I had dinner on a Saturday night (3/19/11) at Spoon in East Liberty. Based on other Yelp reviews and the recommendations we received from friends, we expected quite a lot from Spoon. (We are in the process of moving to Pittsburgh, so new to the dining scene in the 'burgh.)\n\nOur expectations were, sadly, not met by Spoon. Maybe it was a bad night and just bad luck for us, so I'd be willing to give it a go again in the future.\n\nSo, what wasn't up to scratch? For starters, the service was not good enough. We arrived and a group of three old ladies (i.e., easily well into their 70s--one was with a walking frame!) were trying to get out the door. They, of course, were having some trouble with the (heavy) doors and the step down to the sidewalk. Between the two valet guys and two hostesses standing around, there were four restaurant staff who did NOT help these nice ladies. My wife and I instead did the good deed of helping them outside to their waiting car. Not a good sign of the restaurant's respect for their customers. After being seated the first interaction with our server was \""Do you know what cocktail you want?\"" No \""hi, welcome to Spoon\"" or \""how are you tonight?\"" We had just sat down so asked for more time and he just walked off. His gruffness continued, though was markedly toned down to a more acceptable human level by night's end.\n\nThe food. Other reviewers have raved about the food. I've had better elsewhere. In Pittsburgh my experience is limited, but I've had fantastic dinners at places like Salt of the Earth and Tamari. I hoped Spoon was in the same league...that remains to be seen. Compared to some decent neighborhood places in NYC, Spoon just didn't stand out. It was above-average for sure in the food department, but there were too many misses, not enough hits, and some ill-conceived dishes. Perhaps we just chose wrongly and had some bad luck. Who knows?\n\nFor appetizers, we had the enchiladas stuffed with some seafood (swordfish I think, but it was tasteless), and the shrimp and grits. The enchiladas were nothing special. The pineapple salsa was the only piece of flavor on the dish. The shrimp and grits was better, but nothing spectacular. It was a good quality southern version of mushroom risotto, with a gratuitous jumbo shrimp on top. The shrimp was overcooked and a bit rubbery. What a shame.\n\nFor entrees, we had the cod and the \""surf and turf\"" (NY strip and Maryland crab cake). The cod--my wife's choice--was very good. The NY strip was done just fine, but the crab cake was dry and the only flavor came from the standard crab cake sauce on top of it. Our problem with these dishes was that they were a bit too \""busy\""--there was too much going on. For example, the NY strip and crab cake was served with a potato cake and creamed spinach and a caramelized pearl onion. The crab cake was totally unnecessary in this dish.\n\nWe skipped dessert because nothing sounded all that exciting to us.\n\nOverall, for the two of us the total (with standard tip) was about $150 (including two glasses of wine and one cocktail). This seemed too pricey for what we got. \n\nOverall, I think this restaurant definitely has a good team in the kitchen and they are turning out dishes with quality, local ingredients--and that's a good thing. But things were too complicated in the dishes and this detracted from the overall taste of the dishes. A general problem with the food was that the main flavors came more from sauces and garnishes than the proteins themselves. Particularly in seafood-focused dishes. That's a pity.\n\nWill we go back? Sure, we'll try Spoon again. Is this a \""hot\"" and \""must do\"" restaurant in Pittsburgh? Not necessarily; certainly not in my opinion at the moment. It did seem very popular with more elderly clientele, though."
0,"By far the worst Jack ever. Food served was cold as a puppy's nose. Bun, and bacon was hard. Fries felt like i was chewing slippers, or i mean they were chewy like gum, not fresh. Came in at about 10am, prolly food left over from their midnight shift. And plus, manager was chewing gum which is NOT allowed at work. Terrible. Just terrible."
2,"A surprisingly and organized airport for being Las Vegas. I'm so relieved that I don't smell like cigar smoke when I walk out of the airport. Which is good because once you walk out of the airport you are immediately slammed with the unforgiving, brutal, heat of the desert!!!\nThe taxi line is ALWAYS horrendously long!! Just like a line in Disneyland, an endless supply of taxis are ready to take you to your destination and you're off having the time of your life in the adult version of the most happiest place."
1,"Once again, I ordered carne asada expecting the meat to be flavorful, well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Once again, it was a chewy, mediocre seasoned piece of meat. I hedged my bet and order a couple of enchiladas ala carte.  At least those were tasty.\n\nService was kind of roller coastery.  The server took my drink order immediately and gave me a few minutes to peruse the menu.  Food came relatively promptly.\n\nWhen she brought the bill, well she decided it was time to do a deep cleaning of the bar area while I sat and played solitaire on my phone.  Finally she came by only because she was dropping an order off at the table behind me.\n\nThe place was 3/4 empty, but I can attribute this to being 8pm on a Sunday night in downtown Phoenix.  In fact most of the mall was deserted and restaurants closed.\n\nI end with one suggestion.  Lower the freekin light that is hanging over the table.  Nothing worse that having to catch the glint of a halogen bulb burning your eyes while you eat."
1,"I like the Yard House at Town Square, so why am I giving it 2 stars - service, and the fact the women's restroom is in such a state of disrepair (one working soap dispense and stalls with no paper) I finally, FINALLY convinced my friends to come up to Yard House hoping that would be the start of a Happy Monday Night after work football season and the experience was just one misstep after another.  The Manager on duty was so amazing and tried to make up for it in the Best way possible (which I so appreciate because at least they could catch a glimpse of the customer service I'd always received at this location) but in the restroom just before we left an employee almost bounced off my friend and when my friend said \""the polite thing to do is say excuse me\"" the employee retort \""I don't Have to say excuse me\""...wow...just so wow. Now I'm stuck going to to Applebee's."
4,"Can't get em' like this any more. High quality corn fed meat from the Midwest. This place has an excellent meat market, butcher, bakery, and restaurant with home style dishes,  just like grandma use to make.  Decor and style is from the 1940'-50s just like most of the customers. Did I mention they deliver and have homemade jerky. Stop by here before your next BBQ."
0,"My dad bought a club card and added me to the account, I went in to get my own card and the place was 3/4 empty, people were leaving with only 1 or 2 items in their carts, I had to wait 20 min in line to get my card (which I didn't understand because there was very little business going on)  This place is completely opposite of costco.  It's amazing how different the crowds are and what people were buying.  It's apparent that people didn't like what sams club had to offer or their prices since they were buying very very little. Yet when I goto costco it's PACKED and lots of food samples and FULL carts at check out.  Several check out lanes were closed too (just like walmart) \n\nI myself didn't even buy anything at sams club that day.  \n\nI could care less if I ever go back."
1,"the food was great, but the interior of the place was old and run down.. People behind the counter weren't the friendliest. they also have a thing about not putting the napkins out for self service. You get only with your order..."
4,Marge has done 3 tattoos for myself and 2 for my husband! We absolutely love her and her talent is AMAZING! We both get compliments all the time about how beautiful they are! She goes out of her way for her customers. She worked on my husband's back into the morning hours. She loves what she does and that shows through her work!! We wouldn't go to anyone else!
2,"Had lunch there today with a friend.  I've been looking for a good pizza place in the Sunnyslope area and a friend recommended the restaurant that used to be here, which, obviously, is no longer there.  So Villa Italia it was.  There were only a couple of other tables busy at about 1:30, I have no idea how busy they get for dinner.\n\nAs I said, I'm on a mission for good pizza.  Sauce on 7th & Glendale sucks, Pat's didn't do it for me, and though Villa Italia isn't exactly what I'm looking for, it was pretty good.  We got a large sausage and pepperoni and were happy with it.  Bob and I have been eating pizza together for about 30 years, obviously not continuously since we can both easily move under our own power.  Here, the pizza was quite good.  The table cheese was refrigerated, something that quite surprised me.  The pizza was thin, not excessively greasy, with very good flavor.\n\nOverall, the pizza was built very well with good balance, and it was good enough to earn repeat business when I'm back in town.  We really have no negatives to say, our experience was quite pleasant and with good food.  Unfortunately all we had was the pizza, I'll try and go further afield in the menu the next time I get there.\n\nThey're a new restaurant, I wish them luck and success."
3,Tried this place for lunch with a co-worker.  Good fried chicken with nice flavor and crispness.  Would have rated 5 stars but the chicken portions were a little smallish.  I read the reviews about bad service but I can honestly say that our service experience was pretty good.  Definitely gong back!
3,"This is good barbeque in an unlikely spot -- Phoenix.  The meats are all slow-cooked, so everything is fork-fall-apart, Kansas City-style.  They have some variations in sauces, too -- a vinegary Carolina-type sauce, a spicy one and a sweeter KC sauce.\n\nThe sides are well-prepared, including traditional cole slaw; corn; beans; potatoes.  For appetizers, try the sauteed shrimp...perfectly cooked and garlicky.  When all is said and done and you hate yourself for eating that much meat, they give you a brown bag of freshly made, sugary mini-donuts.  Just so you can hate yourself a little more.\n\nService is always friendly and usually prompt.  Recommended!"
4,"My new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte, and that's saying a lot because there are a lot to choose from. I order any of their combo plates and Vietnamese coffee and call it a night."
3,I belong to their Reel Access Club so me and the Mr get some great deals from here.. this last time was 79 weekend and 59 weekday a night.. for the quality of the hotel to some of the best places on the strip to eat its a real treat staying here. Plus going to the LV Convention Center is a cinch with the monorail. I wouldn't stay anywhere else but here when I'm working at the convention center. \n\nBe sure to get Grand Tower rooms.. the West Wing rooms bathrooms are way to small!
3,"We decided to try this carwash after all the good reviews i read.   We went and they had the manager's special for $44.95 regular is about $70, they clean your car inside and out they  detail it { not a full detail by the way, but good enough} And they also wax it.  I was impressed by the customer service.  Saul the supervisor was very nice and explained to us everything they were gonna do, and where and when to pick up our car.  The office is nice  and clean, they have computers you can use while waiting and some massage chairs.  They also have some lounge chairs and umbrellas outside.   all in all we were very happy with the job they did we will be back."
0,We ate at the Arrowhead Mall Johnny Rockets tonight. The service was terrible  and the food was cold. The waitress never came back and offered drink refills or a refill and the supposed unlimited fries. \n\nI worked at Arrowhead Mall when it first opened and ate at the Johnny Rockets a lot. It was a favorite.  I swore it off 2 years ago the last time I had poor service. We made the mistake of trying it again. Terrible.
0,"I used to go to Grimaldi's all the time, but not anymore.  The last time I went to Grimaldi's, I did not have a pleasant experience.  I went there with one of my friends, and we ordered a pizza together along with some drinks.  After we had our pizza in front of us, I asked for some ranch.  Oh, I should not have asked.  They made such a big deal, as if I insulted their cooking.  I'm just a girl who happens to like ranch and pizza, no matter how good it is.  Am I not allowed to have my own likes and dislikes?  Anyway, they refused to give me ranch with my pizza and claimed it's because it drowns out the true flavor of the pizza.  So what??  Their job isn't to tell me how I SHOULD like my food based on their own preferences.  This was a truly awkward and uncomfortable experience, when it should have been a fun and pleasant night with a good friend.  I couldn't even enjoy my pizza, because I felt like I was being judged the rest of my meal there, just for asking a simple question.  I'd rather make my own pizza at home, than to feel treated like that again."
2,"This isn't really a coffee shop... it's a second home for UW students. We were here for probably 5 hours and hardly saw anyone come or go... everyone was there the same amount of time we were.\n\nI wasn't impressed by the coffee or the iced tea and they definitely could bus the tables throughout the day to make it feel cleaner. But then again... coffee, wi-fi, and leather chairs... served our purpose for the day."
3,"Customer service depends on when you go and what location.  I have never been in the Fort Apache location, I only go through the drive up ATM machine.  There is never a line, I get to sit in my car and it takes two minutes, no hassle!  love it!"
4,"WooHoo is right!!! \nThis place features locally sourced items on the menu and you can taste the difference in the food. \nI went in for breakfast. You order at the counter then, good luck finding a seat... \nI had the Quiche Loraine with fresh fruit. AMAZING! I absolutely loved it. It was the perfect amount of food without weighing you down for the rest of the day. \nI had the chance to taste their Hollandaise sauce from the eggs Benedict special and it was the best I have ever had pass my lips (sorry mom). \nIf you need a big greasy hangover breakfast (we all do sometimes) this is not the place to go. \nIf you are looking for a healthy lighter breakfast option this is the spot!"
2,"I don't know what to think about this place. It's honestly just like every other dim sum place I've been to. Cathay House and Orchid Garden....\nIf anything is better it's their English. Hah. \n\nSo in short, if you live in the Henderson area, you should go here because it's close. You don't need to drive far to Chinatown just to get some dim sum. \n\nIN OTHER NEWS. MY SEARCH FOR THE BEST XIAO LONG BAO (Shanghai Dumplings or Soup Dumplings) CONTINUES!!! \n\nthe justeatit rating is: Iwouldn'treallycomeherebecauseit'sontheothersideoftown\n\n#justeatitgirl"
1,"This place is only alive cause of it's location. \n\nVdara has this and 2 fancy bars for their guests to dine at so you have to come here for a bottle of water or coffee at some point of your stay.  I tried their yogurt parfait cup and it was meh.  The yogurt had no taste!\n\nEither way their coffee is illy so it's pretty tasty.  Beware, the line can get super long."
1,"To be completely honest, the food is always awesome, but at this site, aside from the older asian lady the other people are rude. Ate my sushi before i even got my chicken rice bowl... about 20 min later"
4,"My family and I hit this store twice while vacationing in Vegas. My two sons are comic book mad-- they were in heaven. Me?  I was simply amazed comic books no longer advertise Sea Monkeys and X-Ray glasses. My last x-ray glasses broke long ago and I needed a new pair for inspection purposes. In any event, very nice owner and a fun shop. Check it out."
1,"**Tao Club**\n\n///PROS///\n- Great space--ambiance (lounge/dinner floor)--although we did not eat here. Could not get reservations until 11:30--so went to Sushi Samba instead. It reminded me of Tao NY so assume the food would be just as good. \n- I was free (husband $20)--cheaper than SF ($20 each at most clubs w/out headliner)\n- Liked the red light district girls touch--reminded me of Webster Hall (NY, circa 1990)\n- Liked the dancers--but no where near as out there/theatrical as say Webster Hall (NY, circa 1990)--or even Ruby Skye (SF now)\n- OK music 2nd floor, main space (electronic mixed with Top--that is until Hip Hop took over)\n- We pushed our way through all spaces and ended up to the right of the DJ booth leaning up against a railing above the dance floor. At least we could \""watch\"" but as I was there to dance (that was my primary objective for our weekend away) a bit miffed it was impossible. \n- Below our spot were some Dom Perignon swilling rappers with betties dancin' about. No idea who they were (others seemed to) but swilling directly out of a bottle, texting and making out were all funny to watch. They had 4 open bottles at all times available for 5 people--and a corner booth with plenty of space. Too bad we're not them.\n- Snow and money cam flying out of the ceiling--cool touches. Funny that most people didn't notice they were bills--which is probably whyTao sent guys out to pick up the rogues. Cool Vegas touch in any event.\n\n///CONS///\n- On VIP list--showed up a little after midnight and the door guys said they closed it at midnight --thus waited in \""a\"" line (there were several, uncertain what was what)\n- Completely convinced that if I were with a group of girls--I would have gone in. But with my husband--um, a male, we had to wait.\n- NO--none--zilch  space to friggin' move let alone dance at 12:30ish on the 2nd floor. The actual dance floor in the main room on the 2nd floor is amazingly SMALL. It is not comparable to say Ruby Skype or 1015 in SF. Both of which I frequented for years with crowds, huge headliners and space to dance. At times I had VIP tables--but they didn't take up the whole damn joint like Tao Club Vegas.\n- Unless you pay 1K (no where near the dance floor) or 2K (near the dance floor) you are NOT VIP--and cannot move, get a drink or dance. For 4+ people not all that bad--but for 2? \n-  It took us a good 20 to get the first cocktail--standing at the bar.  The three female bartenders would NOT even look at us. As I have been a bartender at a large club early nineties--service really gets to me. And there was no need for them to be quite to bitchy. Acknowledgement goes a long way. Normally an amazing tipper. Not so tonight.\n- 3rd floor electronica not open--even though we'd asked concierge and door guys if Tao was spinning electronica/house Sat night prior to wasting time/money. If it was \""so\"" busy why wasn't floor 3 open?\n- Hip-hop in the smaller dance room on floor 2--but then took over the main dance floor as well (UGH! So left earlier than expected)\n\n///IF YOU GO...///\n- Make sure there is a headliner of music YOU like--then pay for a VIP table near the dance floor. This will enable you to at least get cocktails, dance in place, on tables, dividers and sofas. Otherwise you are screwed.\n- But if you have frequented--or still frequent large clubs in major cities--level set your expectations.\n\n///WOULD WE GO TO TAO CLUB AGAIN?///\n- Not unless we had a table near the dance floor with electronica/house as the main event.\n\n\n***SEE OUR OTHER REVIEWS***\n\n+ The Palazzo\n+ Lavo\n+ Lavo the Club\n+ Azure Pool\n+ Tao Club\n+ Sushi Samba"
2,I think this is one of those places I'll need to visit a few more times to get a real feel for the place.  \n\nThe bacon cheese fries where really good however the hurricane didn't seem like it had very much kick to it.  Perhaps it was only a tropical storm?\n\nIt's pretty close to home so I'm sure I'll be headed here again.
2,"Hubert, Hubert, Hubert... \n\nSorry, I've gotta say this place didn't meet up to my expectations. It's alright for a burger place, but a tad expensive. Having went to Fleur de Lys the day after, I wish I would've went to Fleur de Lys twice (though, my pocketbook probably couldn't have taken it =P).\n\nAs for the Burger Bar, I decided to go for the Hubert burger - trust the chef, right? It was a buffalo burger with spinach, bleu cheese, and grilled onions on a ciabatta bun. Was it a good burger? Yes and no... I mean, it was pretty much just a burger. I thought the spinach was a little weird and the bleu cheese was a bit over the top. The prices, too, were a little high. \n\nI was amazed at their beer selection - they actually have a whole menu dedicated to beers - and they have choices from around the world. I went for the Burger Bar Seasonal since it was something brewed right in Vegas. It was ok - a bit sweet. \n\nOverall a bit pricey for burgers billed as \""fancy\"" - but worth a try. I'd definitely try Fleur de Lys SF before Burger Bar SF."
1,"I got into Koi,  and as soon as I did, I got to the dance floor and my shoes stuck to the ground. It was awful.  They should clean their floors immediately. \n\nThanks!"
1,Food was decent it's only IHOP nothing amazing.
0,"This place is really close too me but unfortunately not good at all. Wanted some frozen yogurt but didn't want to drive to yogurt land so I decided to try this place. Next time I'm in the mood for yogurt I'll drive a little further.\nGranola was so salty, cherries were so bitter!"
0,"$19 for your first month? Sounds great, right! Well, I'm sure it is, but since I am not a Nevada resident, I couldn't get this deal advertised on their website (even though it doesn't say anything about residency). I showed up at the salon and was informed by the receptionist that that deal is only to bring locals in (sorry, tourists, I know it's Vegas but this is one salon that just doesn't care!). It gets better - I'm a CA resident so I CAN get this deal at their Hollywood location, and then it's also valid at this Vegas location! (But I can't get it in Vegas without a Nevada ID, even though it's the SAME THING as getting it in LA except the LA store gets my $.) \n\nLol, seriously? I'm in Vegas, a city run by tourism. I saw a promotion for the salon (designed to increase traffic, one would assume) and I went there to give them my business. They weren't interested. Well, neither am I. \n\nPASS."
0,THey are soooooo slow every time we go to the drive through window. We have decided to change pharmacies.
0,"Worst club/ lounge on the strip! Don't go!!! Bartenders suck! They r too busy trying to get ass instead of trying to make ur drink! Security is a joke... The only exception is Marcus!! 2 fights, my wife got drink thrown on her and we just walked thru the door!! Don't go unless ur desperate  and nobody care, management don't give 2 fucks!! My wife got harrassed by security instead of the Muthafuckas fighting! Daniel, the management of security cares more about getting a $20 tip than taking care of his customers! I come to Vegas, quite often, never again will I ever come to Koi!! Please avoid it if u can!!!"
1,"Went in today, excited by the items listed on a special board outside.  And the food I saw go out looked and smelled very appealing.  Waited for a few minutes, standing there awkwardly, finally was told to grab a seat.  After a few minutes the sole harried looking waitress asked if I needed a menu.  I said yes, and asked for water in response to her question as to what I'd like to drink.  Never got that water by the way.  Several other people came in after me, until each table was full.  I kept trying to catch her eye to place my order, even waving my hand and saying excuse me at one point, but it was like I was invisible.  After watching her take orders from multiple parties who entered after me, I gave up and left.  As I said, the food looked and smelled good, hence two stars instead of one, but that didn't fill my empty stomach!  They obviously need more than one server (I witnessed three people tired of waiting get up and go to the counter for chili sauces and chopsticks), but that doesn't explain why she took orders from people who entered after me, while completely ignoring me.  It's a shame, I really did want to give it a try."
1,"I have enjoyed this slice of heaven but now that changes are being made, I'm looking for a new place. I don't appreciate feeling hustled like I'm at a gym haggeling on a contract. All my favorite teachers are gone so I'm calling around hoping to find them."
0,"I was in town for a national healthcare related conference hosted at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I had never been to Las Vegas before this, nor have I ever gambled. I flew in a day early and stayed at a Marriott in Henderson. I spent the next day hiking to the Hoover Dam and some nearby mountains.\n\nI had a rental car. For a first-timer, the Strip is a little daunting. After some maneuvering, I found Caesar's Palace. I didn't know they had free valet service and wouldn't you know it, the free parking garage is a loooong walk from the check-in desk. \n\nWhen I checked in I made a grave mistake that only someone who has never been to Vegas makes. I didn't tip the registration person before I checked in. This guaranteed me the worst room available at that time. I hadn't done enough homework on the nuances of Vegas. I would be paying for my initial error many times over again during my stay.\n\nI asked if there was a cart I could use to haul my week's worth of clothing and tradeshow materials to my room. I was curtly told that wasn't possible, but I could employ a staff member to do it for me. I declined. Even though it was going to be an ordeal to carry all of it through the floor of the casino, I could physically handle it. I was in the Roman Towers. It took three trips.\n\nAfter I checked in the room, I took a shower. The room itself was a nice size. I had a view of an interior courtyard rooftop. There was no door on the bathroom. There was a handset phone next to the toilet, more antiquated than quaint.\n\nA small TV screen was next to one of the sinks. The bath tub was large and in-charge. \n\nI went downstairs and signed up to get a player's club. I also signed in on FourSquare and was given a free buffet at Lagos as a special. \n\nI told them I had never gambled before and they took their time answering my questions. You can't buy chips with a credit card, but there are ATM machines all around that take plastic. You don't even need to know your pin number (you just pay a higher fee).\nI had set my limit at $100. When I withdrew it, I got a hundred dollar bill (instead of 20s). Next to the ATM is a machine which will turn your $100 bills into smaller denominations. \n\nI found a helpful young lady at the small concession stand near the parking lot elevator who gave me a map of the facility.\n\nI had dinner at the Noodle restaurant by the lobby elevator. The d\u00e9cor is a shocking white pattern with mirrors reflecting light into your eyeballs which still maybe adjusting from the dimness of the casino floor. They had massive fish tanks filled with thousands of goldfish.\n\nThe beer that says draft on the menu is not what we in America consider a draft. It was a weak beer in a bottle and draft was the brand. The noodle dish was okay, but average isn't what I want from Vegas dining, not at the price for my dinner.\n\nAll night I was roused through vigorous banging on the hotel wall at random times. Several thumps were hard enough to shake my bed. In the morning there was no cold water in the shower. Thankfully the bathtub had a hand-held shower extension and I could bathe there. That was the only morning that the shower's cold water didn't work.\n\nI discovered my room shared a wall with the servant's elevator and work room. That is what had made the noises the night before (and every night at random times during my entire stay).\n\nI ate each morning at Lagos and each time, it was excellent (except the last day). They have two lines. If you are a diamond or seven club member, there is no waiting. Otherwise, come at the wrong time, and the line looks like a crowd waiting for a Disney ride. I arrived early enough (8AM) each day that there was no line. Typically by the time I left, folks were accumulating, much more so on the weekend.\n\nThey had wonderful lox, capers and other delights. The waitstaff, almost to a fault, was exceedingly attentive. The only negative experience was when I asked to see if my friend had arrived before I did for our meal. I was told to look from the door but was discouraged from entering to see if he was indeed there.\n\nOn our last morning, the buffet had turned from being breakfast into being a 'brunch'. What that meant for us much greater cost and almost none of the good food we'd been enjoying all week. Lox were gone, and most of the regular breakfast items were either low or out. \n\nAnother friend of mine who arrived separately was incredulous that we didn't know the tip rule. He had the same level of room reserved as we did (same conference) and tipped the front desk $50 on check-in. He was given a palatial, presidential suite. \n\nYou can smoke in Vegas casinos. I don't mind second hand smoke, so it didn't bother me.\n\nThe TV doesn't get many channels other than Caesar/Las Vegas promos/Asian ones. The internet is woeful and expensive, but I didn't expect anything else. I brought my Sprint hotspot and was getting 4G almost everywhere.\n\nThe pool is nice, but randomly, private parties bar all but diamond/7 stars."
3,"I can dig!  Avalon is hidden restaurant among S. Scottsale.  Americanize food by day and trendy hot lounge by night.  Music was nice and loud and danceable, but just hanging with good company will do.  The patio is open but since it's still pretty warm out; they kept the garage doors down ;(  However, the place is amazingly designed (Thanks Gary)  An artwork of a building and I can't wait till it's cooler so you can see the full spectrum!  Drinks are definitely decently priced!  Haven't had the chance to eat here yet, but not to worry; more to come so stay tuned.... enjoy!"
1,"I don't understand why everyone loves this place. I went in with high hopes because of all the great reviews and recommendations from friends. We walked in, the place was totally empty and no server in sight. No music just a TV playing the food channel. After an awkward silent min a server comes out the back. Our server was totally awkward.  When the food was ready he literally brought one thing out at a time. The food was soooo boring. The blandest Indian food I have ever eaten. Maybe it's just the vegetarian items that is so tasteless?"
4,"What's a trip to the West Coast without some authentic Mexican tacos? No where in New York {to my knowledge} has tacos as authentic as the ones I've had in California, notably El Chato Taco Truck and El Taurino in Los Angeles.\n\nSo naturally, during our week in Vegas, we needed to hunt down the best tacos. With glowing recommendations from friends, we trekked to Tacos El Gordo. Ordering was intimidating at first with Spanish flying across the room. Each meat was sectioned off, so if you wanted to order Carne Asada tacos, you'd have to go to a specific section, and so on. I wanted to try them all, so I went from right to left, with my al pastor {pork} taco first, a lengua {beef tongue} taco, and then finally my two carne asada {steak} tacos accompanied by my small {but still relatively large} helping of carne asada fries.\n\nTacos El Gordo was well worth the hype surrounding it. There was always a generous amount of meat in each taco, which was balanced out with the onions, cilantro, salsas, and of course, a warm tortilla. I wish I took some more pictures, but I was too excited about my carne asada fries, eep! Lastly, I got a guava juice pop, the perfect ending to my meal and perfect for combating the dry Vegas heat.\n\nAs one of my last meals in Sin City, Tacos El Gordo was the cherry on top of my perfect vacation. I'll be back for more al pastor tacos."
4,I've been going to Dailey Method since this past November. I have nothing but great things to say. The owner Dawn is one of sweetest people I have ever met. She goes above and beyond. She gives you a tour of the studio and introduces you to staff and customers. For not being from the area I really appreciated that. . All the instructors are nice and friendly. I love Caroline. Her classes are wonderful. I will be sore and tired for days after. It's so worth it! They help you so much. I have never had such a wonderful experience. They also have daycare which is great. My son has a wonderful time.
3,"Arizona mills mall is one of those hit and miss places. Sometimes you find a great deal on just what you're looking for, sometimes you find something you didn't know you needed on sale, and sometimes there's nothing for you. Dubbed an outlet mall by most locals, you will find normal retail and full priced kiosk vendors mixed in with outlet shops like neimann marcus, jc penny, sears appliance, and burlington coat factory.\n\nThe outlet shops will usually save you a good 30-50% over retail cost, but sometimes less. I don't shop here often since it is about 10-15 miles from Central Phoenix; where I hail from, and I usually end up spending more than I prefer.\n\nBe sure to make this a destination for all you discount and penny pinching shoppers.\n\nHappy Shopping!"
1,"My friends and I stopped here to stock up on groceries for our hotel room. Prices were acceptable, considering how expensive things are on The Strip. There was a horrible stench at the entrance that almost made us walk right back out the door. Overall, a dilapidated, sad, and sub-par grocery store. I definitely wouldn't grocery shop here as a local, but it met my limited needs as a Vegas visitor."
0,"Very disappointed with this particular DQ location. My boyfriend ordered an ice cream cake for my birthday as a surprise. He ordered the cake two days prior to needing it (although this location claims they only need 24 hours notice). He clearly explained to the employee that he needed the cake promptly when they opened at 10am to which she replied that would be no problem. When he went in to pick up the cake at 10:15am, it was not ready. The employees claimed that the top of the cake had not been finished, however we later realized that the cake hadn't even been made at all yet. They informed him they needed an extra 30 minutes to an hour to complete it. Two hours later, we came back to DQ to pick up the cake. It looked absolutely atrocious. It was obvious that the cake was rushed to be made as it was not frozen and the icing work was incredibly sloppy. At this point, my boyfriend was very frustrated and asked for a manager. After much conversation, the manager went to the back of the store to speak with either another manager or the owner of this franchised location. He then begrudgingly offered to take the cake back and refund the money or take $5 off the price. My boyfriend decided to take the $5 off, however looking back, we wished we would have given the cake back and taken the refund. I also found that offer quite strange because I am not sure what they would do with an already decorated cake. Regardless, these cakes are quite expensive and should always be made properly and on time. The owner of this location should be embarrassed they are selling such a poor product.\n\nOverall, this was an extremely poor experience and we will never order another cake from this location. If you are looking to order a cake, consider the Windmill location as we ordered one from there previously and it was made perfectly."
2,"I was excited to try this place because I haven't been to any Michael Mina restaurants before but in all honesty the food was a bit of a letdown.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good but I was expecting \""great\"" because Mina's name is attached to this restaurant.  Overall, what I can say about this place is that it was \""nothing special.\""  The only special thing about this restaurant was the starter pita breads that came with 3 dipping sauces.  I ordered the surf and turf and at $59 I was expecting something great.  What I got was a decent filet mignon with an OK side of lobster.  The waitress also didn't ask me if my steak was cooked correctly and had the right temperature which I assumed was just a standard question they ask at these high-end restaurants.  We ordered a side of truffled mac and cheese which was good but the caesar salad was again, nothing special.  Overall a good but boring meal."
4,Awesome brunch. One of the best in CLT. Sit outside and enjoy the NoDa scenery. Love the make-your-own Bloody Mary bar.
3,"The drive to the top is really fun, and the view is worth it.\n\nI really enjoyed it here, but there's too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas.\n\n30 other reviews = TLDR (i just learned that one, see how I'm applying) so I'd rather be brief and useful than wordy and redundant.\n\nI did read Chuck R's review, and I have to say, I wish I knew more of the nooks and crannys that you do, but I can tell you that if you want to explore the Western reaches of the park, do so by starting in the center or east, and not to bother with approaching from the West side of the mountain range itself.  All you'll find out there is a bunch of paranoid, possesive property owners who didn't stop to think that if they chose to own a home on a ribbon of private land that surrounds public land and restricts the public from getting to their public land, then they'll have to endure a little bit of traffic from said public.  Here's a clue for any of those property owners, whether you're on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesn't have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh."
3,"When this first opened it pretty much didn't have much competition, that is no longer true. We have eaten there numerous times and the food is good. We love the crab, so sweet and meaty, even the snow crab. The sausage is perfect, crisp skin and just the right amount of spice. The etouffee is yummy, it actually tastes like the one I had in New Orleans. The fries are good, not really spicy though.  We never had the lobster there, just figured crab was their thing.  My only issue is the explanation of the spice level is sort of off. I can eat very spicy food, but for some reason, maybe due to the messiness, I get cuts all over my mouth from the peppers. On my second visit, I even downgraded the spice level, but yet again the same occurrence. I tend to now stay close to mild. Maybe I have sensitive skin, I don't know. Never the less, it's always a very good meal. But we have had better now. Don't get me wrong it's awesome food. Service is hit or miss. They are just so busy. But even really busy I have had an awesome male server.\n\nThese are my negatives 1.) What is up with the tiny, tiny plastic ramekin for all those fries?? Seriously? Every time I go I have to ask for ketchup like 6 times and every single time (with exception of that awesome guy server we had) they bring 1 tiny, tiny ramekin. I don't consider myself the queen of common sense but I feel like I am dealing with servers that might not have the sense of urgency and common sense gene! If you are busy, wouldn't you just say  \""F it, let me bring her the freaking bottle, because I don't have time for crazy ketchup lady!! \"" ?\n\nBut no, again comes that plastic ramekin of 1 tablespoon of ketchup. Oh, OK I have calmed down, please excuse my rant. I guess I didn't realize how upset I was about the ketchup, I will get over it and move on. ( I don't mean to offend any of those servers they do work hard and service really isn't bad) Plus, I haven't been there in a few months, so maybe things have changed.\n\nNegative #2) The seating is a little congested for my liking. Tables are way to close together. I do understand it's a small place, so it's to be expected. But for me, when I want to relax and enjoy a meal this venue isn't appetizing to me.\n\n3.) 2 restrooms, again it's limited spacing so I understand. But it doesn't mean I like it. And no bar to wait until your table is ready. Maybe I am spoiled. I don't like sitting, if you are lucky to get a seat ,Like I am waiting for a bus outside.\n\nWell, in conclusion, is it good food.? Yes it's great! I chose to come here when the negatives are not going to bother me. When I am hungry and want to grub and I don't care who sees or what I see!"
2,"Good doughnuts, great service. Wish the flavours were more pronounced when it came to things like the *rose* pistachio or the *maple* bacon. Those were the strong flavours that I was looking for. But definitely imaginative."
1,"I'll give Madison's an extra star for it's Happy Hour. It's kind of an okay place to hang after work and get some nachos and a pretty decent martini (it is a vodka bar after all). Come here at night, however, and it's a middle aged, middle America nightmare. Be sure you're good and trashed before you come in here, otherwise you will not have fun. I try not to stay in here long, but my instincts tell me this is a cougar pit."
2,"I really liked Lola Rosa. I found it on a map when I was searching for vegetarian food downtown. \n\nI had the spinach lasagna and it was pretty good. It had lots of cheese and it was very satisfying. My server warned me that it would be about 20 minutes for this, which was fine.\n\nThe service was great. Beer list was just okay. I probably wouldn't come back to this location and would go to their Parc location next time to avoid a bunch of students.\n\nPrices were higher than at most of the places I ate in Montreal. I would come here again but not regularly."
3,"Let me start with this - I love gigantic salads. They're delicious, healthy, and don't leave you with the sleepy food-coma feeling greasy foods do.\n\nHello Bistro is one of my go-tos for dinner. It's a little pricey at ~$10 with meat, but it's not a bad deal if you stack the toppings. Plus, you get to make it any way you want, which is always a plus. And the staff always obliges if you ask for a little extra of a few things.\n\nSome friends have ordered the burgers and fries. They were so-so it seems. If you come here, I would definitely recommend the salad over everything else."
4,Bobby is the best he always listens to my boring stories and does a great job on my nails
0,"They do a great job with their work however I feel like I am just another person interrupting their day when I walked in.  No questions asked, just \""grab your nail polish color\"" and that's about it.  Would like some attention to the customer as this was the case with others too."
2,I love to learn.  I love locals discounts. I hate when I have nothing to do but read. \nAnd read you will. The interactive exhibits are far too few(I remember 4) and the exhibits are either short documentaries (which kept me sane and interested thank God)  or a ton of reading with very little photography or displays in between. \nI was really looking forward to being blown away. I guess I was holding this place to the same standard as the Atomic Testing Museum...  Which I guess I shouldn't. And what a bummer too! What cooler subject matter is there...  Really!? \nDo yourself and your children who are under 12 a favor and take them there instead. I witnessed a small child crying because there was no one who would read to them all of the displays. \nI guess if anything.... The courtroom exhibit as awesome and the gift shop.
1,"Update: I had eaten at Destihl a couple months ago, and the best word for my dining experience at that point would be \""inconsistent.\"" Last night I returned to Destihl so that I could form a more definite opinion. For my main course, I ordered the Brewmaster's Pizza, which was served with chicken, andouille sausage, ale onions, and an espresso-chipotle barbecue sauce. The pizza was nothing to rave about, but it probably would have been quite a bit better if a) the pizza had been served hot instead of lukewarm and rapidly cooling, and b) the crust had been cooked all the way through. My brother's pizza was also apparently cold and undercooked, and reading through the other reviews, this seems to be common for diners at Destihl who order pizza. I think I've probably accumulated enough evidence at this point--Destihl is not worth the high prices. There are so many better restaurants in Champaign."
2,"After a three night stay at the Cosmopolitan and three nights checking out Bond, this small bar near the LV Strip Entrance did not live up to hype. It's a-ok, but was dead all three nights except for some people gambling on machines at the bar. \n\nThis Bond was nothing like the cool suave style of a sexy British spy. \n\nIt was more like Double O Disappointment. Hey-yo!\n\nWe must of went during an off period because there were no DJs or dancers any of the nights. It was just a nice, clean bar. Again, it's fine, but nothing exciting or really special if there aren't dancers or DJs."
1,"Had pretty decent stores, but prices were not that amazing to me. parking garage was super crowded and took forever, I wish we would have valeted b/c after walking around the outlets I didnt want to walk back to the car. They had little spray misters like the ones at amusements parks to keep you cool in the blazing heat, but it started raining on us, so those didnt really do us any good. They have an inside food court but I didnt eat there."
2,"A good-valued eat certainly.  My wife and I split one potato with 2-toppings.  It wasn't extraordinary, but it did do the job and put a dent in our hunger.  There's only 1 table to eat at - pretty much no space at all.  Recommend splitting a meal if you can."
0,"I can't comment on the food because I was never actually served. \n\nThis place deserves negative stars for service alone.  The food would have to be unbelievable to get me back in the door to give them another chance (judging from the other Yelp reviews, I highly doubt that it is). \n\nAnyway, my wife and I came here for lunch. A host seated us, and then we sat. And sat. And sat. Another family came in about 10 minutes after us and were served immediately. That's when my wife got up to tell someone that they'd forgotten about us. Rather than a simple apology and sending someone over to take our order, this guy (manager? cook? who knows?) starts making lame excuses (your server is busy with something else) and running and the restaurant like a chicken with his head cut off flipping through sheets of paper at the host stand and who knows whatever else. \n\nAt that point it was clear that giving Lulu's any of our money would have been completely undeserved; so we left."
0,"The food was bland and the service was slow.  My Mom ordered a shrimp salad, and it had a ridiculous amount of lettuce in it.  The burger was undercooked and had no flavor at all.  I was not impressed, expecially for the prices."
2,"I have eaten there many times. As  Maricopians know there are not many choices unless we go out of town. The service there seems to be hit or miss, sometimes its great and other times you feel invisible. since the new menu came out the prices have gone up and serving size much smaller. We usually get the loaded steak fries and when they changed the menu the plate was 1/2 the size. when asking the server if the portions are smaller, she stated no they are the same just different plates. NOT the fries are in a much smaller plate and that plate is on another larger plate(the one that used to have the fries)  the wing there are great but I always ask for them well done or they are mushy and under cooked.  The place needs a make over and is kind of dirty when you look around. I have been in the food industry and the public areas are the most important. If they can keep that clean then you can imagine how clean the areas you dont see is (kitchen)  I try not to think of this when there.\noverall its a good place to go but needs better management. I love to support local places and would do anything to help them out. but they must work to earn our business also."
0,I was NOT a fan of this place. At 1st I thought hey cool place but quickly changed my mind. The bowling sucks because you have to pay for the hour and then you get kicked off your lane. The drinks were terrible I guess the waitress said something was wrong with the lines. Nope nope not coming back here. Waste of money.
1,McDonald's is McDonald's. This location was dead slow despite there being no one waiting for service. Cashier purposefully overcharged my friends because they were dunk. Horribly rude to do that.
3,Want cheap hole in the wall Chinese deliciousness? Yup this is the spot. It kind of reminds me of Chinese food in New York. Great lunch menu. This place will have you coming back.
0,"We ordered food 20 minutes after we got here....still no food, on a Tuesday, gwith 20% occupancy!!! Don't get me wrong, they definitely deliver on the \""cocktail\"" portion of their name, but not the \""kitchen.\"" The servers are attending but are idiots/could give a rats ass! They are as forgetful as they are stupid! Definitely fun if you're hammered and cannot notice but otherwise go home for better service and cheaper drinks!"
4,"Getting ready to leave on a flight home the next morning, we would get a small snack and drink at Chili's which was located a block from our hotel.  Have gone to our neighborhood's Chili's which I consider just an average restaurant.  We sat in the bar area.  It was just before 4 pm and the waitress came back and said that it was Happy Hour and the appetizers were $4.99.  We ordered 2 - one flat bread pizza and some kind of nachos.  I was surprise of the size of the plates.  We were totally satisfied.   The service and 2 of the staff we dealt with were so nice.  Can pay electronically from the table which we really liked.  Highly recommend for a snack or bar drink."
1,"The BF and I stayed here this past weekend because we booked last minute and this was the cheapest option at 70$ per night. Let me start by saying, although this place isn't bad, I never want to stay here again. The room was fine, but the bed was old and uncomfortable and the bathroom had random hairs all over....the cleaning was pretty far from thorough. My main complaint, though, is although they have a shuttle to the strip, it ends at 9 pm....so obviously, we had to cab back....and the cab ride cost 35$....whoa. There goes the savings. I can see staying here with a family as they do have a lot of things all under one roof....movies, bowling, casino, restaurants, and even an animatronic show....It's just not for me."
2,"I like Tee Pee. It's just a basic tacqueria that's been there for a long time and has fairly cheap food and fairly decent table service. You can get a lot of different basic Mexican items, including the Arizona version of a burrito (called a \""burro\"" here). Margaritas are a bit watered down and can be ordered by the plastic pitcher, but if you speak up they'll mix in a bit more liquor for you. One warning--the salsa is hot! \n\nGood place to go on a weeknight with some friends. Plenty of families in there, too. I'm guessing there's a wait on the weekends, though I haven't tried."
1,"Out of 5:\n\n2.5 - Fries\n1.5 - Wagyu burger: very overcooked, dry\n2.0 - Beef burger: cooked better, but still unsatisfactory\n\n4.0 - Salty pretzel shake - delicious, chunky, and a lot."
0,"Mango in salad still frozen. Cactus in salad from a can and briny. Received my ap at same time as friend's main, my main came 10 minutes later. Slow but enthusiastic service. Clearly passionate about authentic Mexican; small store with Mexican products onsite. Overpriced. Left annoyed."
1,"This is the old OTB on High Cross with the softball fields/sand volleyball courts and is half-bar, half restaurant/banquet area. I have been only once since they changed ownership.\n\nI hear that they have good food, mostly reminiscent of the apparently hallowed former Chambana institution of the same name. The word is the current owners bought recipes from the family that ran the old Po' Boys. Next time, I'll try the BBQ.\n\nWhen I went (in winter), I had beers and a fried cheesecake with jelly syrup and ice cream dessert in a martini glass. It was really good. Service was also good. Beer selection was pretty good, about a half-dozen of the usual suspects on tap with a better selection in bottles, although the prices were kinda high.\n\nThe room on the right seems perfect to rent out for a medium to large size gathering. I have been a over the summer to watch folks play sports (when it was still the OTB), and it is pretty good for that. Decent prices on light beer in bottles.\n\nAll in all, this place is merely average at best, with prices a little higher than I would expect. If you live out in the country and this is the closest place to you, I can see it being your go-to place, especially to watch sports. If you live in central Chambana, dont have a softball or volleyball game there, and are not a BBQophile, you have no reason to go to Po' Boys."
3,I have been coming here for years. The owners a great people and seem to remember everything. I'm from a really small town in ohio and this place reminds me of home. The food is always good and there is a ton on your plate. I always get a ham and cheese omelet with an English muffin. Although a friend of mine got the French toast and i thought about stealing it. Great hidden gem. I will continue to be a regular here. \n\nTry the pancake challenge if your man enough.
2,"Ok... I will just say this. I am of German descent. I love German grub. I love German culture. I love German beer halls. One of the last three things was not on target here =\\\n\nThe guy playing the horns, downing beer, singing, while wearing traditional German leather pants was awesome. He definitely helped to liven up the atmosphere. However what made him even better was that he was having people play quarters for prizes, having contests for free beers (I won one, but was about to drive to LA and thus couldn't drink it) and I am sure he has many other things of a similar nature that I missed since we were there at lunch on a Sunday.\n\nPro Tip: I know Oktoberfest is going to be awesome here. Bavarian brau haus... ohhh yeah...\n\nThe murals, architecture, beer are all authentic. The food is a bit off though to me. I ordered the Oktoberfest Bratenteller. This is a double dish sauerbraten and pork roast. They each had a different gravy. The sauerbraten comes with a dark brown gravy with a slightly sour note due to the vinegar marinade that it left in for a few days. The meat is tenderized due to the marinating process and is done well. However the taste of the gravy seemed off to me. The pork roast was in a traditional German mushroom gravy. The pork was also tender but the taste wasn't on point to me again. It seemed that the gravy again wasn't like I am used to for most German food.  The pork roast mushroom gravy was also a much lighter shade than I am used to. However what had me crushed as that the sp\u00e4tzle wasn't that good. Sp\u00e4tzle is my most favorite part of German food. It is a noodle that when smothered in gravy is phenomenal. However here I felt it was anything but. =\\   \n\nPro Tip #2: Most of the items in the gift shop are a weee bit overpriced ;)   so unless money is no object, I bet you can find that stuff cheaper elsewhere.\n\nService was kind of funky as well. The fraulein who was serving us, was somewhat inattentive and missed some basic things that the other waitresses did not. The details are what will make or break ya, and she forgot to ask if we wanted straws or lemon in our water when every other table had them delivered that way. She had a preoccupied air and was almost mentally checked out it seemed. \n\nPro Tip #3: If you sign up for their online newsletter (on their website), you get free beer coupons!\n\nOverall, I would come here for the bier, camaraderie, German culture, drinking songs... Heard the pretzels were good as well, but the grub perhaps would be better on a different day/night or perhaps I ordered the wrong item. I also disliked that we got there during lunch time and didn't receive a lunch menu but a dinner menu =\\"
3,"Thank you to the girl who helped me with my GoPro3+. I came here looking for a monopod that was waterproof for my roadtrip to California. She quickly knew what monopod we wanted and gave it to us.\n\nWe also inquired about the LCD screen. Totally did not know that GoPro did not release the new models to fit for the 3+ but she was still kind enough to check the back storage for us. I didn't catch her name but she was really helpful. She worked at the camera section on 10/29/13 around 7PM. Please tell her thank you.\n\nAnyway,  overall impression on the store was OK. It was definitely a bit different than Best Buy in Hawaii. The mainland stores have more variety and the workers were very helpful."
4,"My friends and I ate here for lunch today because I saw an ad for them in the paper and I read such great reviews online. I read one bad review & because of that, I wanted to see for myself because I LOVE good Mexican food!  (The bad review said,  \""All the great reviews must be fake because the place looked nothing like the pictures.\"") The place looked exactly like them to me. (\""The service was horrible.\"") Our service was excellent! Our waiter was great, the manager was great and the chef even came out and checked on us twice! He even gave us a free dessert! (\""The food wasn't good.\"") Our food was delicious! I had carne asada street tacos, my friends had shrimp tacos and enchiladas. We were all very pleased with our meals. I'm very happy I found this place and will be returning often. I'm guessing the bad reviewer probably works at a competing restaurant nearby!"
1,High hopes for this place but left disappointed.   Decor is hip and classy.  Drinks were good.  Liked the music but was way too loud- huge pet peeve of mine at restaurants.   It was freezing inside the restaurant even though we weren't seated next to the window.   Servers were nice though flustered seeming.   Menu sounded exciting but everything that I tasted was kind of blah.  Crab/ salsa-  too salty and tomatoes tasted either old or canned.  Lobster flauta was underwhelming.  Spicy seafood stew was way too salty and not that flavorful.  So much potential for the location of this place
3,"Pricey coffee, but if you've read my past coffee shop reviews, anything else on the Strip is better than Starbucks.  They do have a good selection of gelato and desserts to go with your coffee and it's got a great location at the Palazzo right where the Living Garden is located.  So after you pick up your drink you can just sit down and enjoy it right in front of the waterfall.  It's a nice pit stop when you need some sugar to keep your motor running."
4,"I would like to sublet a plot of land on Tom's Thumb. \n\nThe availability of things inside this CAR WASH is so expansive, yet specific, that I'm almost certain I just made it up. \n\nExceptional pulled pork, sleek leather purses that convert into backpacks, southern biscuits and grits, southwestern themed wine corkscrews, Quest bars, half a dozen kinds of BBQ sauce, old fashioned doughnuts... Everything one would see in a bizarre dream? Nope, just everything I bought. \n\nIf that's not everything on your list, there's also an impressive cat paraphernalia department, as well as imported soaps, and summer campy throwback ice cream novelties. \n\nIf you're just looking to go out to eat... at a car wash... that's also a nice restaurant with a patio.... and a coffee bar... and a bakery, then boy, is this the spot for you!\n\nAt lunch, go for the pulled pork sandwich. The classic hickory BBQ sauce leaves nothing to be desired. Put the mayo-less cole slaw on top. Skip the brisket, which is drier and tougher, and don't order a side of fruit unless you want just pineapple and apple. \n\nBreakfast is down home phenomenal - the pig 'n' grits offers you not one, but two kinds of frighteningly delicious pig items - bacon and crispy pulled pork atop creamy grits. Covered in cheddar cheese. Add an egg. You are welcome. The biscuits are scone-y and delightful, and the coffee is great (but for all y'all frapp\u00e9 wimps, rather intense.) \n\nTl;dr - Tom's Thumb is le shiznit. Get anything pulled pork. Bummer that it's so conceptually redonkulous it probably doesn't exist, save for in my head... great idea, though, right?"
3,"First, it's free.  While it's not as big as my favorite museums, I like the place being spacious, clean and, again, free.  It's a great place to learn about Scotland.  But if history is not your thing, consider it as a great place to get a break from the crowd and from the winter cold."
4,"If you're in the mood for some authentic Indian food & spice this is a place to go... The food is absolutely fantastic down to the  Naan bread- spices are true to scale & flavors are on point! \nThe location doesn't look like much when you first pull up; in fact might find yourself questioning your choice, but trust me you will get over it as soon as you try the food. \nAlso, this is a very family oriented restaurant, so bring the kids and whoever else in your family tree. -B"
2,"Honestly, I did have my doubts, and had to be answered. Knowing that they built this during an economy that is still recovering. I give them a pat on the back for having the guts to open up a bar/restaurant in this bad economy. \n\nLocated off Craig and 15,  next to a Hampton Inn, lays a bar/restaurant call Whiskey Dick's. Which is a decent location, mainly off the freeway and next to a hotel. Not far from The Cannery, for you gambling needs. But back to Whiskey Dick's, the place seems decent. Your typical bar place, with a restaurant on the other end. Kind of noisy in a sense, but of course you got people watching sports and drinking. Sitting down to eat, may make it difficult to hear the waitress or difficult for the waitress to hear us. Then there is that scenario, where its hard to hear across the table, to the point that you have to raise your voice or yell to get your message across. But if you're into the bar scene, more than the restaurant, it might be a good place for you to grab a few beers and watch the game. Sitting down to eat, may have mix feelings, depends how busy the place is. \n\nA few things I like, is the staff being nice. The waitress was prompt, even though she did look a bit worn down. I'm guessing since its only her taking orders and serving, it can really wear out a person. That, or its nearing the end of her shift. But she stayed prompt and was nice about serving us. \n\nAs far as the food goes. It is my first time there, so its kind of hard to say. But the fried macaroni cheese balls and a pepperoni pizza was mainly the main course. I'm a pizza person, and I did like the pizza. A bit on the greasy side, but, still fulfilling. The macaroni cheese balls, not so much. It was a nice concept, but the fact of eating the hard edges, felt like I was eating the macaroni out of the box. A bit hard and chewy, till you get to the center, which was okay. Just a bit hard on my teeth. \n\nOverall, Whiskey Dick's does have its ups and downs. Like I said before, if you want to grab a beer and watch sports, this is a decent place in the north end. Sitting down to eat, depends on when you go and how hungry you are. Another good thing I like, was the menu and how funny they name their food.  As well as the comments they describe that food. Other than that, I'm still iffy on coming back restaurant wise.  Beer and gaming wise, maybe."
3,"I recently attended a wedding at the Charlotte City Club and it was gorgeous! Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view, but the meal was high-quality (hands down the best macaroni and cheese on the planet). It was definitely one of the best dinners I've had at a wedding. They also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent.\n\nReason for 4 stars?  I wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiff-overly so. I had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times.  Also, the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band. For that reason I would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception, but over-all it was a very beautiful space."
1,Guacamole needs help! Fish tacos were good. Taco salad was good too. They need to keep doors closed to keep flies out!!!
1,"Went for lunch. Ordered the ultimate grilled cheese creamy veg soup. Soup was lukewarm but very tasty. If you wanted croutons or cheddar on top extra charge.\nUltimate grilled cheese, not so ultimate. I expected tons of cheese and there just wasn't that much.\nMy friend ordered the summer chicken salad, lots do lettuce but very skimpy on the chicken. \nOverall, a bit pricy for what it is.  I prefer Jason's Deli or the corner bakery, or Mimi's.  My lunch was over 9 with tax and no drink."
4,"We had a fun night, the show was absolutely amazing and highly entertaining. The acrobatics, stunts or whatever you call them were so precise and mind blowing. I often catch myself with my mouth open. Hubby and I can't wait to see the other Cirque shows."
4,"I had been working out at a CrossFit Gym near my home in Orange County, CA for 3 months when I dropped in on North Scottsdale CrossFit in Scottsdale during a business trip.  \n\nWhat a great community of friendly individuals who are pushing themselves each day to improve their overall physical fitness.  \n\nThe gym is easy to access and has plenty of space.  The class leader Kevin gave specific and tangible feedback on my form and encouragement on my intensity.  \n\nIt was such a great workout! I never get that on my own.\n\nI look forward to joining them on future trips to the Phoenix Valley."
1,Been wanting to try for a while. Stopped in for lunch. Got an Arizona burrito. Took 10 minutes to make. Home made tortilla. Small and bland. Not worth going there again.
0,"Came here with a party of 15 (we had a reservation). They were completely unprepared for us. We arrived at 7 and they first tried to seat us at a table for 8. They then moved us to the bar area and sat us on 4 different round high top tables. Whatever, we can make that work.\n\nWe all ordered our drinks and it took over 20 minutes for them to all be delivered. Mind you, many of us just ordered water to start with as we were going to be going out afterwards. 20 minutes is just insane to wait for water!\n\nAnother 20 minutes goes by and our waiter (who's name I never caught) FINALLY came to take our orders. We knew it would take awhile for our food so we all sat and chatted. Food finally started coming out and as it came out he had no idea who ordered what, so we had to figure out what was on the plate and who ordered it. My food was alright, though at first it didn't come with the potato's that I ordered. Instead of just bringing me a side, he took my entire plate back and came back with mashed potato's very haphazardly placed on the side.\n\nOne of our diners didn't get their food until almost everyone had already eaten. She ordered chicken tenders...they aren't that difficult to make!\n\nSo up until this point we were all a bit peeved but could deal with it.\n\nThe real disaster hit when he went to give us our tickets. Out of 15 checks, only 2 of them were right. He charged a pregnant lady 2 alcoholic beverages! It's not like he just gave her the wrong ticket, she was the only one that ordered what she got! So he just had no idea who ordered what.\n\nI got my check and it had an iced tea on it that I didn't order. He took my check to take it off and I didn't get a new check for another 30 minutes. I almost walked out without paying because we were getting tired of waiting, but I'm an honest person and I wouldn't have felt right leaving without paying.\n\nFINALLY the manager came out to assist him. Why wasn't she there the entire time? I have no idea! But she was about as much help as a log. She apologized, of course. But did we get any sort of compensation? Nope. She did decide to send the person that the party was in honor of a gift card to come back. Something tells me that gift card will go unused. I know I will never return to this establishment.\n\nWhy was that poor waiter left on his own with a party of 15? Why didn't ANYONE help him? I saw at least 3 or 4 waiters pass by our table and not a single one of them thought that maybe he was struggling. Now, don't get me wrong...our waiter was about as personable as a stick in the mud, but still...we couldn't help but feel sorry for him, he obviously had no support from management.\n\nGet it together, Houlihan's. If you can't handle a 15 top, don't allow them. I doubt ANY of us will ever return to your establishment. And you really put a damper on what was supposed to be a really awesome night for our bride-to-be."
3,"In town for a fun weekend and a buddy took me here for a morning cocktail and a bit of food. The free breakfast with your purchase of a drink is awesome. The menu is simple and to the point. \""Scrambled or regular eggs\"" and you get a big helping of hash browns, toast, sausage and bacon. Drinks were strong and crowd was good. 4 stars. Service could have been a bit faster. Overall highly suggest this place if you are looking for a quick drink!"
0,"Was convinced once again by peers to try this place.\n\nOliveo's delivers pretty mediocre/flavorless Greek for a \""bargain\""  price. Bargain being around five dollars for anything on the menu. \n\nThe taste.... It tastes like 99\u00a2\n\n\n\nRecap from my visits: \n\nBad greasy falafel (prompted me to review the falafel was truly terrible)\nTasteless Gyros\nSides that stayed....well on the side\n\nGo to Haji Baba nearby instead... or anywhere else for that matter.\n\nI guess location keeps em in business~"
3,"As most fellow reviewers pointed out, if you do not have bottled service, prepare to stand the entire time.\n\nApart from that, there was a lot of room to dance, and the music was good too.\n\nCoat check is ridiculously mismanaged."
2,"This theater is pretty standard for Regal.  Employees are nice, snacks are fresh, and the theaters themselves are pretty clean. \n\nOne of my standby theaters.  :)"
2,"I've had two incredibly different experiences at this place. One so great that I was dying to come back and the subsequent one so shitty that I'm not sure if I'll ever return.\n\nThe first time was with a friend who was passing through Charlotte. We sat outside to enjoy the amazing weather and catch up. He had a ton of wings (they were half off) and I had the brisket sandwich. We started the meal with fried pickles and pimento cheese. Everything rocked, from the service to the meal.\n\nThe second time I brought my girl, sat outside again (in the same table even), and looked forward to another great meal. What we received instead was horrible service. Our waitress cared so little about what she was doing it felt like she was in physical pain just having to stand there and take our order. We had better service from the other waitresses handling the outside than from our own. We could only suffer through ordering a drink and then left as quickly as we could.\n\nI'm torn. Five stars on one hand and one star on another. I know that two data points don't make a trend, but after such an uneven experience I find it difficult to convince myself to go back for a third time."
1,"Okay, so who likes to go to the DMV to begin with??? While there are many cool things going on in Charlotte that make life easier and more adjustable, especially for us transplants, the DMV is not one of them! \n\nRight when the whole system got much easier and smoother in NY, I come down here and it is pure chaos - if you need to come here be prepared to free up an entire morning and/or afternoon to wait around and do nothing but watch Dr. Phil on the one TV in the waiting area. If your experience is anything like mine, people in Charlotte will scare you into thinking that the written test is so difficult that you will waste two whole evenings \""studying\"" for it. Then you will get there and take it, only to find most of the questions are completely obvious and not so difficult. Although, warning, they do throw some curveballs at you, such as where the \""no zones\"" are when it comes to 18-wheelers, and you also should study your road signs. Better to be more prepared, because if you don't fail you can't retake it that same day, you need to come back and wait all over again! PS good luck parking!"
1,"Highly disappointed. I ordered for delivery 2 lunch specials and a 2liter soda. The delivery driver forgot the soda. The lunch specials said they came with rice and soup or a spring roll. We only got the rice. There was hardly any meat. And when you order from a Chinese restaurant, fortune cookies are expected. We got none. For $20, this was ridiculous. Don't think I'll be eating here again."
0,"In its former life (aka Radio Milano), this restaurant was in my all-time top 5 in the Valley. A go-to neighborhood fave, Radio Milano had a pleasant environment, amazing food and best-of-all -- neighborhood night on Mondays and Tuesdays. \n\nI found the current Radio Cafe is a big letdown. The menu has been revised to largely comprise of sushi, yet the rest of the items don't seem to follow the Japanese theme. It's an awkward concept that I don't think will satisfy the reputation that Radio Milano had.\n\nDon't think I'll be back or recommend it to my friends."
2,"Good god, this forever21 is huuuuuuuuge!! I didn't know where to start and I was quite overwhelmed with it all!! I didn't want to spend hours in there so I just casually walked around and if I saw something I would stop and check it out. \n\nI love their accessory stations! For some reason, I am going apeshit over headbands but missed that section and found it after I paid. -.-;; Seems like everything is downstairs.. I went upstairs and it was not as crowded and didn't seem to find things that suited me up there. They do have the kids, extended, heritage, twelve by twelve all in this one store. Pretty gnarly.\n\nThere were soooo many workers here too. And what is with the guys in suits at the doors?! My bf's sister said they were security.. they look like bouncers for a high end nightclub or something. I didn't think the workers here were that friendly at all. I saw many of them.. none of them said \""hi\"" or asked how I was doing.. that says a lot especially when they were tons of em.\n\nAfter paying I walked around for a little trying to meet back up with my in-laws but after looking for 5 min.. I called it quits and decided to wait outside!\n\nI don't come to fashion show mall very often but if I do.. I will be back. Especially if people want to walk around.. I will just kill 3 hours in there."
2,"Being a country music fan, this is a place I felt like I needed to visit at one point in my life. I was a little underwhemled with the \""crowd\"" [it was pretty dead] but it was a cold week night so I'll cut them a break. The band was pretty good, but didn't pull any people out onto the dance floor. My friend and I ordered some nachos...pretty freaking good. and huge! Enough to feed like 4 people! She had a drink but wasn't too fond of it. Bar tenders were nice. Hopefully next time I visit, it's much more exciting."
2,"Can I put three and a half stars? I'm a fan of somethings at Ikea, but not all......\n\nOk, what deserves a lower star rating is their furniture. It's hip and modern and all, but NOT quality......so, depending on your needs, you might love it or hate it. Even their leather sofas....try lifting the sofa with your foot (stick it underneath the front of the couch) with a good quality sofa, you SHOULD NOT be able to budge it at all! At Ikea, don't think you are super strong when it moves....it's just not of a superior construction, that's all.\n\nWhat I DO love Ikea for is all their home stuff, like kitchen gadgets (tho, beware, some aren't that great.....I bought a 'quick chop' here, and it fell apart after like 5 uses!) Their decorator items are great, as well as the lighting department. One of my favorite pans is from Ikea (the mini stockpot with a fit in collander...use it all the time!)\n\n If you are moving out, or are newly married, fill your kitchen with Ikea stuff.....way cheaper, and most of the items are just as good as anywhere else (i.e. spoons, bowls, cutting boards, plates, glasses....etc) \n\nThey have a great selection of curtains for decent prices, and a lot of rugs to chose from. My pillows come from Ikea too (they have different types, like, pillows for people that sleep on their side or stomach or back, or whatever...) They're cheap and comfy!\n\nIt's also fun to browse around their little grocery store....the smell of baking cinnamon rolls will intoxicate you as well.....Tho, I like to stop by their cafeteria...their smoked salmon is the best! (I don't know how I can talk about cinnamon rolls and salmon in the same sentence, but I just did....)"
2,I pretty much agree with the mixed bag of reviews for this place.  Yes the line is long and it's pricy.  This rating is Not based off that.  \n\nEclairs.  Boring.  Very very run of the mill.\n\nChocolate cannoli.  Pretty good.  Not worth the wait.\n\nLobster tail.   I do not understand the hype around this.  It's an oversized cream puff.\n\nAmerican Napoleon.   This thing saved the day!  It was AMAZING.  I will wait in a line just to get this next time I've have a sweets craving in Vegas.  Absolutely the best thing I had there!
3,"What I loved:\n- Beautiful suite with fantastic tub and wonderful view from the wall to wall windows (if you can get a suite on a high floor with an even number between 2-10, you'll have a great Bellagio fountain view!)\n- Non-smoking hotel.  This was perhaps the best feature for me.  It was so refreshing to come \""home\"" to a stench-free environment.\n- Location/access to everything.  Vdara is actually very convenient.  There's a walkway to Bellagio with Aria & Cosmopolitan right out the front door and Monte Carlo (and the south strip) is just a quick, free tram ride away.\n\nWhy it's not a 5*hotel:\n- Extremely low quality linens.  Sheets were like sleeping on cotton/polyester sandpaper and towels were thin, stiff and a couple already had holes.  Very odd.  I have never seen such low quality and have had much better at Hampton Inns & Best Westerns.  I know they are going to eco-friendly, but eco-friendly does not equate to terrible quality.  I was so happy to get home to my bamboo sheets & soft, fluffy towels.\n- Extremely low quality bath products. The bath products were equally terrible.  Usually I bring my own shampoo/conditioner/lotion - but lately when I've stayed at nicer hotels, I find that their bath products are so nice, I feel silly for taking up space in my little quart sized carry on, so I didn't bring any this time.  Oh what a mistake.  They were absolutely atrocious.  I ended up stopping by Sephora and picking up some sample size products to use for a 2 night stay (that bad - couldn't even manage for 2 nights).  I suppose it's worth noting that they do sell travel sized Aveda products in their spa/salon.\n- Sparse amenities.  No real restaurant, you have to request robes or coffee maker if you would like them (not a big deal, but seems like this should be standard for a 5*).  No HBO/movie channels/etc.  Again not a big deal at all, but it just struck me as really odd.\n- $25 resort fee is for a sparse fitness center with no locker room/sauna/steam room (you have to purchase a spa day pass or spa treatment to access that), 2 tiny bottles of water and wi-fi (which is free throughout the hotel, not a sign-on).  Eh - just found that irritating.\n\nIn short - if you get a killer deal, the room alone is worth the stay. However, if you think of it as a 5* hotel, and compare to any other 5* in Vegas, you'll be very disappointed.  I'd say it's very on par with the MGM Signature - except you don't have a fun balcony."
0,This place sucks! Had to tell them to vacuum my car again when I said why my inside looked so opaque customer survive guy said obviously the services are rushed were busy. Paid for the VIP. Waste of money. My car doesn't smell so I didn't get my air freshmen and my inside was def not dressed. And to top it off they parked my car underneath a tree with pollen falling. Fail!!!!
2,"Stop #2 of the night, Axis-Radius. Two big clubs connected by a catwalk. Another really nice looking club that is just enormous. Double decker on both sides, a lounge upstairs that overlooks the dance floors and a few huge patios. You get your choice of music depending on which side of the club your one. Hip Hop on the left and Pop/Dance on the right. Another Scottsdale club just packed with the beautiful people, what do they put in the water out there? One ingredient is definitely bleach. And I thought we had a lot of blonds in LA.\n\nThe club is really nice but not quite as good as Myst, however they did sell cigars here which complimented the large open patios.\n\nThere was a line and $10 cover. Expect the velvet rope treatment if your not there before 10:30. Odd they try this tactic, it's Arizona not LA or Vegas."
2,"The Flamingo is a pretty good deal for the money considering the location. There is nothing glitzy or fancy about this place (as most other yelpers have noted) but they have a very nice garden area with beautiful fountains and flamingos hanging out. It was a nice distraction from the chaos that is the strip.\n\nNothing really special about this place to note. They have decent sized clean rooms and the casino is centrally located to other cool places (Caesars, Bellagio, Paris, etc). They did not have a nightclub that I recall but have a few bars and most importantly a 24 hour cafe for me to pig out at 3AM after a night of debauchery."
2,"Nothing special.  A typical sports bar.  I had the chicken and ribs plate.  The chicken was good.  I like the BBQ sauce, and the fries (steak) were really good.  I don't usually like steak fries, but these were nice and crispy.  The ribs, however, were really fatty.  May have just been a bad slab, but quality control should have kicked in before they ever made it to my table.  All in all, nothing special."
1,"After wanting to check this place out for a while now, I was not impressed. I went here with my boyfriend on a Sunday night. We went with the intentions of only smoking hookah. \n\nWhen we walked in, we were informed that for hookah there is a $50 minimum per 2 people. I instantly wanted to leave, but decided to stay since we were already there.\n\nHookah was ridiculously overpriced ($30 per hookah; $15 per refill). Then to fulfill the $50 minimum, we ordered the hummus and two iced teas. The hummus was decent, nothing over the top. The iced teas had a weird odor to it, I think it might have been the ice.\n\nThe hookah was the only good thing, which for $30 I would expect it to be. We got the limboberry lemonade. I was satisfied with it.\n\nThe service was decent. Our waiter was good but nothing special. When we needed new coals for the hookah, no one was to be found and we actually had to ask our waiter for more.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't go to this place regularly."
0,"Food was not good.  Service was the worst.  Together, I rather eat at Burger King since it is in the same plaza.  Let's just go over service to not waste time.  We ordered an appetizer along with other dishes.  Finished our food, waited 10 mins to get a chance tell them that we wanted the bill and to tell them that one of our dishes never came, so it can be taken off the bill.  After another 10mins, the appetizer was out and owner Henry looked at us and said with a bad attitude, \""you know we have to throw away the food if you don't want it, right?\""   Still no check. \n\nYes, I know.  In fact, I think we ALL know.  Did you know how long we waited for it?  Did you think I ordered it for fun?  \n\nYou know I ordered it because I want to eat it, right?  \n\nCome on. Staff up.  Serve your food timely.  Make better food.  Just in case if you don't know.  I ordered it because I want to eat it and pay for it."
3,decent authentic cantonese food. peking duck was really good. reasonable price with big portion. open till 6am with late night menu. good choice for late night cravings and after party goers.
1,The portions are small and the food is pretty average overall.  This place seems to try too hard to be something they are not.  You could get better food at PF Changs and for a better price.
0,"This was my second visit to the buffet and today was a huge disappointment!!!\n\nThe line was so much shorter than my first visit.. only 20 min. on Wed afternoon early dinner instead of two hours!\n\nWe were seated promptly and we picked up our HOLIDAY dinner priced at $35.99.\n\nWhen I glanced at the food lines, most dishes were out!!! Out of food at a buffet??? I should have known that there was a poor management. When we returned to our table to eat.. all of us picked up grilled asparagus. I have NEVER seen a grilled asparagus that bad.. it was almost like chewing a bamboo stick.. impossible to chew asaragus??? something was not right!\n\nI called the manager to let him know. He agreed that it looked bad, but did nothing about it. Again... poor management!\n\nThe rest of the food was okay... not even wanting to go back for second rounds at a buffet. That's how bad it was.\n\nI will not waste my money going to a place like thus to eat ever again.\n\nBottom line.. bad food will loose costumers!!!!!"
1,Great place one of my fav .... But the service is sooooooo bad it hurts to leave a tip
3,A pretty decent airport.  It gets you going to where you need to be.  They have phone charging stations.  The food was pretty good.\n\nThis place got me to where I needed to be; it did its job and Yay! I'm a fan.
2,"Similar to Laura l, I was less than thrilled that I got this hotel while bidding on priceline, but overall, it turned out ok.   \n\nThe biggest Pros of this hotel were definetly the beds and the shower.  OMG, sinking into that nice, HEAVENLY bed, after a night out...the best ever!  The shower with the double showerheads...very nice.  Location, I thought, is also good, although it's off the strip.  But the places I was interested in going were all really close, and especially if you're planning on driving around, you can drive around the back of the strip and cut your travel time down by at least half! sitting on the strip during traffic times...not so fun.  So the location worked out well for me.  I LOVED their line of shower soaps and lotions that the Westin uses...a green tea line (im sure they call it something that's a little more catchy tho haha) and it's my favorite of all the hotel soaps and shampoos i've experienced yet.\n\nAs for the cons.  First off, the room was pretty tiny...and checking in, we didnt get a very nice receptionist lady.  Maybe it's because we dont look like we're old enough to be respectable? Iono.  Also, while, i liked that the lobby was really small, and you didnt have to walk a mile through a casino to get to the elevators as other hotels might make you do...this place is packed with a lot more business-y and professional people, and if you're walking around in your 'vegas-only' attire...you get a lotta weird stares and creepers.  *shudder*  The pool was just alright too...SUPER tiny...good thing we werent in the mood to hang out by the pool, cuz i dont think we would've fit!!  Other than that, my only other complaint is the seemingly lack of service they provide...most hotels i know will provide you with toiletries if you happen to forget them...and it's not like i was asking for a suitcase full! All i wanted was a simple toiletry item, but they had us go to to the gift shop to buy it at like a 500% markup. \n\nSo overall, good and bad to this hotel...i would probably still come back though, knowing what i know now so that i'd be prepared in advance."
2,"The show's history and legacy is almost palpable, and whether or not that is a good thing is certainly up to you.\n\nImmediately I felt like I was in a time capsule: The iconic showgirl attire, flashy lights, traditional moving props, and the choreography was astounding. The choreography taking center stage almost felt like an anomaly because mainstream shows these days tend to focus more on raunchy jokes, magic tricks and the lot. To see such traditional choreography be the main focus was a nice treat. Everything flowed well.\n\nOr at least it probably did 10-15 years ago. There is no denying that some of the prop and attire just looks weathered and aged. The show's age is certainly a double-edged sword. If you can turn a blind eye then it shouldn't bother you. But for those that have been spoiled by great theatrical engineering such as \""O\"", Ka, or Le Reve, you will immediately notice the difference.\n\nJubilee! was never intended to last until 2012 and it needs a revamp. The show might be enjoyable for those that are sick with Cirque du Soleil, but I just don't see the \""wow\"" factor in it. Sure, the dancers are fit and great at shaking their booty, but after a few sessions (and some awkward juggling acts during the intermissions), the charming element begins to wane.\n\nHowever, this is undeniably a true gem in Las Vegas' iconic image. If you want to see a bare-bone Vegas style show, there is no better than Jubilee!."
1,"Definitely not the Venetian!! The room is tiny, the bathroom is tiny and the hotel is inconveniently located.\n\nHowever, the beds were comfortable. However, I found the roll-out bed was not. \n\nHousekeeping is pretty prompt in delivering towels.\n\nNonetheless, the place is cheap!"
2,"I was looking for a local favorite here in Gilbert and came upon Nicantoni's, from reading previous reviews I decided to try it tonight. We ordered a Sicilian pizza and it was very very delicious, however the service was absolutely horrible. Our waitress (thin, dark long hair) messed up on our order which we waited 25mins for and had to wait an additional 25mins to get it fixed. We did not receive a single apology for the mess up at all. So all in all the pizza was great but next time we will definitely do a pickup instead of a dine in."
0,"If I have the choice\uff0cI don't even give one star. IT's my first review ever. I had bad bad bad experience. I bought a pair of boots in the store and I only wear them about 30 mins and I didn't even walk out the casino, my boots hurt my ankle real bad. Then I walkEd back to the store to return the boots all I got was a bad attitude and no returns, not even store credit. Only 30 mins, can any of u believe it. I would never buy anything from this brand any more"
4,"This experience was soooooo much fun!  The bottle service really helped though (What's up to promoter Rob).  We got the hook up with free bottle service.  Free Kettle One all night long (you can't beat that)!  We were at a table in the middle of the action.  The servers were beautiful and very attentive.  Great music, wonderful atmosphere.  I would definitely go back!"
4,"I'm not sure how big the niche is for gourmet southern food while waiting for your car to be detailed, but apparently there is a large enough demographic to develop in one in North Scottsdale.  \n\nThe best way to describe it would be to imagine a QT where every aspect of the traditional gas station/convenience store concept was redesigned by the shopkeepers at \""La Grande Orange.\""   \n\nWhile I didn't have my car shined, I can attest that the southern-ish cafe inside serves up some of the tastiest southern food I've had in the Valley.  They absolutely nail their pulled pork, grits, bacon, eggs, etc - and good lord their Carolina BBQ sauce would fit right at home in Gastonia.  I'll be back with friends - and maybe a dirty car."
1,All our food was bland and burnt. 2 nights in a row. Probably cuz we stumbled in past 3am. But still. Come on.
3,"I stayed here, so none of that 'posing' where I rate this place cause I was gambling or something.\n\nCheck-in was a breeze.\n\nThey have these glass things bolted to the roof. Each could easily be like 20-50 lbs a piece.\n\nThey have security at the elevators 24/7 which leaves creepy wanderers out which is nice. Some peeps I knew were in the other tower and even though I flashed my card, they never let me go up by myself, which kinda sucks.\n\nThe atrium/garden is definitely worth checking out. They always change the place according to the seasons and is a nice reminder that Vegas is NOT just about sex, drugs, and alcohol.\n\nThe chocolate fountain is so amazing and draws a crowd, you just wanna end up taking a chocolate bath or something.\n\nTheir pool area is pretty chill and laid back. Definitely a family/adult feel to it. It was Memorial Day weekend and there weren't any pool parties, just folks lounging around.\n\nIt's really well maintained and there's always staff cleaning various areas.\n\nThe fountain outside also makes it feel cool to stay here, knowing that people are gathering outside just to check out a water explosion. :P\n\nOh, and free Wi-Fi? Hells to the yeah!!!"
1,"Want to make a grown man sob like a baby?  Tell him that the steak is so good at CUT that it ruined you for any steak thereafter....then take him to CUT and watch as he licks his lips, takes a long sip of his expertly chosen Bordeaux and eagerly slices into his $130 piece....of fat and grizzle.\n\nThen have the waiter smash some glasses on two of your guests and focus on cleaning the mess instead of apologizing to them.\n\nThen clear my plate while my back is turned so I can't ask the waiter if the guest chef tonight is smoking crack.\n\nWill I give them a second chance?  Of course.  Will I get psyched up before I go?  Not this guy.  CUT is a serious place so I'll chalk all this up to a \""series of unfortunate events\""."
1,"I have a bone to pick with the lowes on Rural and Baseline Rd in Tempe. I am an electrical contractor and I understand the slow down in sales and business. I had purchased trims from the Lowes at I10 and Ray which had been marked down to half price. I needed 4 additional trims which inventory showed they had but they weren't found. They called over to their \""sister\"" which showed 13 units in stock. They sent me over to pick up the remaining needed trims directly after purchasing the last of Ray's stock. The units at the Baseline store were not clearanced and they would not honor their own price from another store though I had my receipt in hand showing the lower price. I've never had a problem like this with Home Depot. Frankly, I am a little disappointed that in a time when sales are slow, a company won't bend over backwards to accommodate a customer.  Cheers for \""Orange team\""."
4,"It's hard to find a good place in this big city to call \""Your BBQ Pit\"" but Dickies totally makes you feel at home. We go every Monday and have been for about a year and a half now and absolutely love it! Employees never forget a face and know your meal on the spot."
3,"First night ever in Vegas and didn't know where to go, so I went to this place with a friend. Just wanted drinks and to my surprise, they had hookahs too! It was super hard to track down the guy running the hookahs (even though the lounge wasn't that big), and service was horrible. Because it took the guy 30+ mins to get back to us, we sat on these speakers and got our hookah for free. Perhaps it was the \""free\"" part that made the experience all that sweeter (and worth an extra star)."
2,In town for the weekend and trying to adjust my schedule from EST. Decided to get the Vietnamese Coffee to wake me up. It woke me up but very disappointed with the portion. I finished my coffee and 3/4 of the cup full with ice.
0,"Not worthy of any stars!  The groomers could not handle my 7 lb Yorkie pup.  They said all they were able to manage was a bath. Ummmm.. Why the sleepers in his eyes when I picked him up??  We've had our puppy for 5 months, and this was the first time I actually heard him cry- all the way home.  He was traumatized.  Shaking uncontrollably.  I wish they would have called me immediately instead of traumatizing my dog for even a second."
0,"Here goes... And I sincerely hope Steve Baltz reads this...\n\nI was just here on Saturday night with my boyfriend and three other friends. We chose this bar to partake in our 'Halloween' festivities this weekend. I had never been here before, but a couple of my friends had and they said it was neat. Being a huuuge fan of Bar Smith and the overall rooftop bar concept, I was really excited to go here. But now I cannot say I will ever be back. \n\nThey did a Halloween contest contest which was extremely poorly ran. First of all, they kept mixing up the prize money. One announcement said first place was $300 and one said it was $500. Very confusing. My friends and I thought why not, let's enter! We went up to the DJ booth where you are supposed to enter, and the DJ looked at us like we were crazy when we asked him about it. Not sure if he couldn't hear us over the music. But he looked at us and then just continued to spin! Really weird dude, and he honestly seemed like he was on something. He put our names down with our costumes. Okay, whatever.\n\nThen comes contest time and everyone is supposed to go to the stage. We get to the stage, it's a huge cluster fuck. Lots of dudes names were being called, and in particular one guy who everyone cheered for. Then we heard the guy who was running the contest say \""and our last contestant is.\"" WTF? Me and my other two friends' names never got called. So the contest ended and first and second place went to TWO DUDES. TWO DUDES. Ummm way to make the contest a total sausage fest. Isn't the point to have at least one hot girl win? Or at least showcase some hot ladies?? Terrible marketing strategy for a lounge. Okay... Still not super mad at this point. Also, note that there was a first and second place. So what happened to third place that was supposed to get $100???\n\nAfter the contest we go up to the guy running it who is standing there with the guy who won, obviously his friend (what a surprise). And we told him that we signed up and never got to go. He looked at his list of names and shrugged. Then we complained some more like what the hell man, and he just said \""ill buy you drinks\"" or something like that and shooed us away. Needless to say, we never got those drinks and usually when you TELL someone they can drink on the house you WALK with them up to the bar and get them a fucking drink. Real classy dude. I was extremely annoyed with the way this guy treated us, whoever he is. And mind you, I am a completely understandable person. Had our names hadn't been called on accident and he sincerely offered to make up for it, that would have been totally fine and I would have appreciated it so much!\n\nWhen you run a bar, you need to have good customer service, and when you make a mistake you need to make up for it. That's definitely not what happened, and it took everything in me to not poor my gin on this dude and get kicked out at that moment. But we brushed it off and danced a bit longer. I will never go back here again because of the way we were treated. I will tell all my friends to not come here as well. Very trashy place IMO. You can add all the nice decor you want, but if you treat your guests like shit, it will show through that you're not the establishment you claim to be."
1,"Burgers are ok. The ribeye and mashed potatoes were flavorless. Stay in the restaurant area, your clothes will smell like smoke in the bar. The waitstaff and bartenders are cool. I probably won't be back."
4,"This place is pretty cool! Its inside Bass Pro Shop, which you think at first is kind of weird and would be really small, NO not at all! Bass Pro shop is huge and this restaurant is also. When you first walk in you can see a large fish tank that separates the front room dinning area and bar from the back dinning room. Once you get around the bar and the beautifully large fish tank, the restaurant opens up into a large dinning area. The celling is very high and the space in there is just so opening and welcoming. The decorations with the fish on the walls, the tables, the large fireplace in the middle of the dinning area, the paint, the fish tank..... it all works perfectly together to create an outdoor ambiance, with a lot of class and openness! I really loved the way they have this restaurant set up, its beautiful!\n\nOk onto the food! We received an order of I believe sugar glazed bread when we ordered our drinks! Oh my goodness this bread is delicious. The sugar on the top gives the bread a little extra mmmmmm. It might just be me because I cant eat a lot of bread due to my gluten intolerance, but I had to have at least 1 piece! They have a great spread of different kinds of meals, from chicken, to sea food, to steaks to alligator! YES I said alligator! I have never had alligator before, so of course it was one of the appetizers I ordered just to give it a whirl! The best way to describe the breaded alligator, is that it has a shrimp texture, with a chicken tenderness to it. So its a mix of shrimp and chicken. It doesn't have a weird taste or bite to it at all. The sauce that was served with the alligator actually really played with the flavor well! It created a nice little extra bite to the gator to give it more flavor. For my main dish I had the shrimp pasta. The alfredo sauce was different, and really blended with the shrimp well. It was nice to have a dish with large pieces of shrimp to eat and not little bite sized shrimp. My friend ordered the cajun chicken pasta. This dish was served with the same alfredo sauce as mine but with the cajun taste instead of shrimp. I have to say his chicken was spiced deliciously and I enjoyed his plate much more than mine. The combination of the cajun spices along with the alfredo sauce made a great dish!\n\nThe staff here was incredibly friendly, our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful when we asked about he alligator dish, the manager came and checked on our dishes as we were eating and everyone wished us a nice goodbye as we left! I like going to places like this, being surrounded by friendly people who enjoy their job and having a great meal, its just a great way to start off a good Sunday funday!"
1,"Romados has started doing delivery service and it's not amazing.  I love their food (I wish I could love their sauce, but it has gluten in it) but Romados is really awful if it isn't fresh. \n\nMy fries came cold with a lukewarm chicken carcass.  Dry and inedible.  Maybe you should stick to in-store or figure out your takeout containers!"

4,"I have to update my review to the full on 5 stars. They deserve it. The last 3 times I have dined here it has been perfection. They have stepped up their game as a new east side restaurant. Got rid of the things that didn't work and embraced those that did. A family owned joint, that remembers their regulars. I have taken friends, family, and kids here and every time everyone is happy. A couple items that I personally love are the deviled eggs, the edamame, and the fondue. For a dessert you can't go wrong. There is the cookie-mon, choc chip cookie, and ice cream. Simple and great. There is the happy ending, which comes with popping mochi pearls. Or the Brie dawg with bananas and Brie cheese. \nThe most recent experience I had a full striped sea bass. I've never ate a fish with the head still on it, let's just say it was very pleasant. I plan on continuing to dine here until that isn't an option anymore. Well done Nosh & Swig!"
0,"There was nothing I liked about this club. My friends and I came here after recieving wristbands in the Sugar Factory. We when we arrived  They seem to be a bit unorganized. Or the line is way long. Entrance and exit is by stairs. This seems lazy, but for those that are in heels and have been dancing the night away, an elevator or escalator would be nice. When I asked if there was an elevator, the guy told me for it's for handicapped. The place is tiny. The area they call the dance floor is packed with people. I've been here twice and never plan on going back again."
1,"The hostess in front was not at all friendly. She didn't even welcome us. Just asked for name and party. That was kind of a bad start... The wait was 50 minutes for Sunday at 12... We waited the 50 minutes Bc I had wanted to try this place for a while....we were seated in 53 mins. \n\nThe waitress Megan took 10 mins to greet us at our table ad she wasn't all that helpful. When I asked if the waffles were good and she replied, \""yeah.\""  Let me tell you after she too our order she did NOTHING for us. We actually ordered another side dish through another waiter.  \n\nThe busboy was great! Always filling up our water cups. We personally gave him cash tip and left our waitress with a 5% tip Bc again she did NOTHING. She didn't even serve our food get us condiments. NOTHING. \n\nMy husband got the ham steak which took 20 mins to rcv. I ordered the waffles and it took 30 mins. Again I ordered waffles- not chicken and waffles just waffles... 30 mins. \n\nThe male waiters were all very nice and attentive to us and our needs.. All of the women workers seemed to have a pretty large stick up their............ \n\nI will not return here again.. So disappointed in the upgraded ihop/Denny's food.  Not worth the wait, money or rude service. Blah!  \n\nThe service was so bad that my husband who never complains about anything, was even pissed and called the manager... He spoke with \""yushon?\"" And she offered to pay for our next meal which we all know is the restaurants way of saying \""shut your complaining\"""
4,"My sister and I were in Madison and went to Great Dane twice in one week!! Beer, food,,service and atmosphere were all good.\nCheese curds were delicious, pretzel basket was tasty try the spicy mustard dip. Our favorite is the tomato mushrooms soup it was hot and enjoyed each time on our cold fall visit."
4,"Whenever I'm off on Wednesdays, I try to take my nephew to the storytime they have here.\nBest of all is it's completely free!\nThe staff is so friendly and great at reading to the kids. So fun to see all the kids read along and sing along. Always great to get kids imaginations running so early in childhood.\nWe like to borrow books and DVDs after storytime. \nNot to hate on other libraries but, this one is so new and clean. It's easier to find books and dvds because of this. They don't seem so compacted into a small space."
4,"Had another great lunch recently at the Bauer Kitchen. I really want to try the sandwiches on their lunch menu, but I'm never able to because the daily feature sandwich always wins me over. This time, I had a slow-roasted pulled pork sandwich with bbq sauce, coleslaw on a house-made cheddar ciabatta. It was extremely filling and delicious! The meat was tender and succulent, perfectly complemented by crunchy coleslaw. I'd eat this sandwich everyday!\nMy mother had another lunch daily special- the fish and chips. I'm so happy that they let us substitute regular fries for sweet potato frites with no surcharge! The accompanying lemon tartar sauce was rather lackluster, but all in all, it was still really tasty and satisfying.\nWhat a great place for lunch! I'm really curious to try their brunch menu as well."
2,"Sat out in the back patio here. I loved the low key vibe of this place and how easy to was to grab a seat. I had a ripper (hot dog) with slaw and spicy mustard, and a cup of the jack Mac. Hot dog was tasty and delivered my meat fix. I was a bit disappointed by the Mac n cheese though. It was more \""liquid-y\"" than my preference and clearly had not been baked. It was good and I ate it all, but reviews would have me believe it was the best in town. Definitely not the case.  Service was pleasant but very slow, especially for a quiet night.\n\nIf I lived in the area I could see coming by here on a whim for a drink and a bite. But as it stands I do not live nearby, and there wasn't anything in particular that would make it a destination for me so I will likely not be back."
4,"I love this place!!  Very good food at reasonable prices.  Be prepared for a wait with large groups and at peak times, but the food is worth it."
1,"I'm honestly surprised to see these good reviews. I picked up a large cheese pizza - simple as can be. It was burnt, and cost almost $18.00! Absurd."
3,"I've been going to drip now for almost a year now, I love it everything about it.  Gina is always super friendly, and the food is always great.  Free Wi-fi makes it the perfect place for me to wake up in the morning, have a nice breakfast and study in an actually well lit and open coffee shop.  THe only reason I can't give it five stars is I do wish that it would be open past 3 pm, but after 3 I have to head on over to Lux."
0,Not so great.  The hot wings were not good. The flavor was bland and had hardley any sauce.  I had the stuffed numero one-o that tasted very bland and had too much cheese so it melted on my plate. The person next to me had the thin crust which looked pretty good. The wait was extremely long which eould have been okay if food had been worth it. On top of it all it was a little pricy for pizza. I would not recommend this place.
0,"The food is bland, overpriced, and bad service (although our server was sweet) everyone else was rude. I ordered a chicken caesar salad, my husband ordered the shrimp scampi. I didn't taste his food after he said it tasted like the smell of Raid. The chicken in my salad was so bland I had to pour a bunch of salt in it. Not to mention it took them forever to bring out our food."
3,"Grab a drink while waiting in line for the Sunday Seafood Brunch cuz the line is long! Luckily for us we came before 11 when the madness started. As for the food my only complaint is that they should buff up the sushi section a little. The rice is a little hard and the sushi fish was dry. Otherwise, you get the hallmark carving station with the prime rib, the selection of Asian to Italian cuisines and my favorite the desserts! You also can't hate on the unlimited beer and wine that comes with lunches and dinners. A must try!"
3,"I make it quick\n\n- overall I think this is a very nice Airport\n- nice entertainment, even when you have to wait for your luggage you can watch commercials on the big screen\n- your luggage gets to the belt pretty quick\n- slots almost everywhere you go to spend some of your money\n- lots of shops to spend even more money, if you did not lose it all at the slots\n- No rental car pick up directly at the Airport, the bring you in a Bus to the Rental Car Terminal, that sucks since it took more time. \n\nBut other than that a very convenient Airport, I liked it!!"
3,"When you want a great burger, expedient and friendly service and a casual welcoming atmosphere, this is the place!\n\nThe selection is great, prices reasonable, food fresh and best of all, never too busy to accommodate your special requests.\n\nMy partner and I look forward to future visits and giving 4 stars only due to ordering at counter prior to seating and not table side. This is perfectly ok and the post order delivery table side follow-up service in ensuring you have all you need is perhaps better than the typical competitor."
1,"I haven't been back here in a long time and the restaurant certainly aged so much. It's old and run down. The atmosphere was not pleasant. We weren't even acknowledged when we entered. We were just standing there waiting for a few minutes before the server came to sit us down and it's not even busy. The food was not what it used to be, dry and not flavorful. We have had better Thai food and probably won't be back."
0,"The general manager Becky at this location is very rude! I showed her an online coupon that did not state one per customer (clearly Arby's fault! ) and she was clearly pissed off at me. Slamming stuff around an yelling to the other workers \""I knew this was going to happen\"" I do not normally eat here and this was their one shot at potentially gaining me as a regular customer but no thanks to Becky I won't be returning even for free food! Horrible customer service training Arby's!! This is your management???"
2,"FINALLY got a call from the manager of the office after emailing twice. I received 3 months of free contacts, which is great since my lenses are really expensive. The manager was really nice and wouldn't stop apologizing for the awful experience. However, when I went in to pick up the contacts, all of the girls at the desk were rude. There was no \""How are you\"" or any of that. I even witnessed one of them say \""just sit down over there and I'll get to you in a minute\"". Only reason for the 3 is because the manager was so nice once I got her on the phone."
3,"I've been a fan since going to their NY location. I love hot chocolate...and I love hot chocolate in slushy form. The price is a bit steep, yes...but the same goes for the rest of Vegas so I don't really have any complaints. I'm not nuts about the food. It's decent enough and if I was rating this place on food more than dessert, it'd probably score a 3. \n\nI think it's pretty convenient that they have a take out counter outside. The wait for getting a seat in the actual restaurant usually takes between 30 minutes to an hour, but there is plenty of seating in the surrounding areas to indulge in chocolatey goodness. With all the glitz and glamor of Vegas, this is a simple and fantastic dessert to have during your stay."
0,"After gazing at the scantily clad actresses (and actors--for the ladies) for the duration of the show, the only thing I could say to my wife was \""Wow, we can never unwatch that.\""\n\nThis show is just awful. Horrible plot (or lack thereof), painfully annoying songs and minimal action. I wonder if originally the cast was more clothed, but then they realized nobody wanted to watch this garbage and decided to \""skin it up.\""\n\nThe drunks standing next to us were more entertaining than this disaster.\n\nI'm getting irritated just writing. \""Free\"" is too much to pay to see this show. Give me back my twenty minutes!"
1,"I saw the mixed reviews, and thought, let's give it a chance.  It's close, it has delivery, and I might get lucky.  Even after placing the order with the lady who didn't speak a lick of English (and had to call back to repeat our credit card number six times), I thought \""Hey, she can't speak English, it must be authentic!\""  Well, that logic fell short.\n\nThe sushi rolls were by far the worst I've had in a while.  I'm not being a snob.  I've been satisfied with sushi from supermarkets -- but this place just doesn't cut it, especially for the prices.  As for the other items: salad dressing, bleh.  Miso soup, alright. Tempura, bland.\n\nOn the positive side, I've heard that poor quality sushi means lower mercury content!  So here's to my health."
2,A good meal on 10/1/14. Very reasonable price for the quality of the meal and great service. Not my favorite meal in Vegas but worth the visit.  The interior of restaurant is less than special and reminds you of a low end Vegas buffet versus a fine dining establishment. I would visit again if on this end of the strip but would not make a special trip.
4,"First of all, the salon is beautiful, what a gorgeous, new and CLEAN salon. The experience was so professional from the time I walked in the door. The place was sort of high tech, I did my whole transaction on their salon IPAD which ultimately made their front desk look more neat and less cluttered. I loved the interior, the stations are high quality, you can see they didn't cut corners in the salon.\n\nI had the pleasure of being styled by Ellice, who is the salon's senior stylist. This place is solely a hair salon which I think is pretty cool. I was taken when my appointment started, which is very important for me. Ellice educated me on the special product line that she carries in her salon, only she and maybe one other person carry it off the strip, its super exclusive, which makes me feel exclusive too. I feel that she invested a lot in her products so that I have the best experience and overall results. Ellice focused on me the entire time, she wasnt juggling a million clients at a time which I have unfortunately experienced in the past. Also, I have the thinnest most flat hair, and I walked out of there with more voluminous, soft and shapely hair I've ever seen on my head. I thought that was great but I figured I would step out and in two seconds my hair would lose all of her hard work, but it didn't...not until I washed my hair again!! My hairstyle was maintained, man this girl works wonders. I highly recommend Moda Di Capelli, Ellice and I'm sure any of her other stylists will do the same stellar job. Everyone was so accommodating and welcoming, the way a salon should be. I'll definitely be going back."
4,"If you are looking for a delicious burrito, go no further! My husband and I are huge fans and eat here weekly.  The carne asada burrito is my go to choice. The ingredients are fresh and the tortillas are made in house. I highly recomend the salsa/chips and horchata, if you are looking for a little something extra. We always get friendly service and the building is well kept and cutely decorated."
4,"I have been friends with the owners for many years even before Gyro Time opened in 1978. The food has always been excellent & continues to get better, with bigger servings and more tasty yummy cucumber sauce. Today I got to sample their soon to be added gyro slider, a BBQ gyro with cheese & bacon on a mini pita for about half the price of a gyro. That's gonna be an extremely delicious addition to an already great menu! So definitely visit anyone of their 3 locations or try them all!"
4,My favorite Sunday spot.  I have never had a bad experience with the service or food.  I would recommend a skillet or the sundance omlette (yuMmm!)
1,"Consider Zyng as an overpriced Thai Express. I had the soba noodles with grilled chicken and spicy peanut sauce, and it was fairly disappointing. The food wasn't flavourful, the proportions were small, and the chicken was dry. Equally disappointing was the vermicelli with grilled chicken that my friend had. \nThe waiter we dealt with was also quite crude. As we had placed a takeout order, we had declined to tip because no service had been provided. Immediately after paying for our meals, however, the waiter processing our transaction asked us forthright whether we would be tipping in cash now, or tipping later. This is really poor waiter etiquette, and while we acquiesced, we should not have been asked that question at all."
0,"Expensive ($80 breakfast for 2 adults and 2 small children), pretty low quality (I ordered eggs over easy and they were over hard), small portions (3 egg omelette was 2 eggs at best, french toast came with one piece of bread cut in half) and very very slow service. Nice atmosphere in a neat place but otherwise abyssmal"
1,"Royal resort....from the outside and the lobby it appears you are staying at a pretty nice place. Step off the elevator into the dimly lit halls and you see a place in desperate need of an update & a deep cleaning! rooms are small! balconies overlooking the strip are true however balcony is very small and it overlooks the riveria ( also run down) and circus circus ( a dump)! Rugs are dirty, bedding is old, pillows are few and flat. The TV is an old fashioned 27 in w so so reception....in the day and age when flat screens are cheap as heck.although reasonably priced will definitely not be back until it's totally renovated and deep cleaned"
4,"*Do Not Let The Wait Scare You Away!\n\nTo sum up our experience in 1 word: Superb! This place is just fantastic. We have been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile. Tried going a couple weeks ago but the line was too long for a party our size. Tried again last Sunday and only had a minimal wait. It was well worth it.\nAll the employees were very friendly. Our waitress was patient and helpful. The prices were reasonable and selection vast. The wait for the food to come out after we ordered was pretty minimal for how busy they were. And the most important part, the taste... Well that was just perfect!  I wish we had room to eat more because it was that good.\n\nForget the plain ole run of the mill Denny's and Ihop... You must give Biscuits a try, you will not regret it!"
3,"Hurray! Another option for lunch on Mill. They have scrumptious pastries, handmade breads, soups, sandwiches, quiches... Went in the other day and had the  Turkey Brie Panini with apples and walnuts and a tropical iced tea.\n\n My meal was great and so was our service. I have to go back to try one of the hand-dipped Bouch\u00e9e chocolates especially knowing they are prepared on site by a chocolatier!"
1,There were still feathers on one piece of chicken.  Need I say more?
2,"Any Cirque du Soleil shows are guaranteed to be a spectacle-- and sure enough Le Reve was no different. As much as I enjoyed watching hot men with hard abs jumping into water at great heights, 75 minutes of it was more than enough. Honestly, they lost me 20 minutes into the show. Maybe I don't appreciate the art-- but I really didn't get the storyline at all! I understand it's suppose to be \""A Dream\"" but a dream about what?! Hot men running around being hot? Fine, guess that's quite a dream.\n\nWe sat in the splash zone and barely felt any splash! Any seat in the theater is a good one but if you're looking to save yourself a little cha-ching.. do the splash zone!"
2,"I wanted a burger the other day, decided to finally give Smash Burger a try. \nI went for the Arizona Big Burger. Guacamole, Jalapeno. Regular Smash Fries. Large drink. While the burger was nice and juicy, tasted very fresh.....I have to say the fries just weren't my style. Super thin and oily. I enjoyed the burger, but for the $12 I spent, there are just other places to go around here. While I didn't buy one, I have to say their Beer Prices were pretty ridiculous. $3.49 for a Can of Kilt-Lifter? $2.99 for a Can of Macro Domestic? C'mon. Then again I was in SnotsDale so I can't speak for the prices at other location. \nWill I go back? Maybe. Next time I will skip the fries and enjoy a better than average burger."
3,"3.5 stars but I'll round up.\n\nBeen here multiple times and never really had a bad experience. However, did have awkward experiences haha. \n\nMy first time was with bun and got my Rose MT. Pretty sweet where I could taste the rose so I was satisfied. But it was a little hard to concentrate when the cashier, with really big boobs, was taking our order. I looked for bun and me - sorry but they were huge lol. It was also a bit different with another waitress asking if I enjoyed my drink...when I have not taken a sip of it yet lol she was trying to be friendly, but I guess it felt a bit forced. \n\nOther times I went with bun and guy friends, bun made me realize that tipping there may only be for the experience - not so much the food. The popcorn chicken we ordered was dinky and more of like an appetizer size - costing $5.25, unfortunately it was very delicious, comparable to SF. The drinks also, are a bit pricey, small mason jar MT dine-in is about $5 I believe and with choice of syrup, it's around $5.50 - so a snack is as much as a drank lol\n\n^ going off of going with guy friends, this place is more of the experience not so much the food/beverages....\n\nAnd prepare to not cock-block your guy friends too when you go. Waitresses come to you less when a female is present lulz....\n\nreally. that wasn't my intention, guys. honest."
2,"I don't understand the draw of this place. The atmosphere is fun and staff are great, but the food just isn't that outstanding. I had three tacos: carne asada (meat was tough), shrimp (tastes like algae), and I can't even remember the third which is a bad sign. Also, the prices are such that you're paying at least $1 per bite. I much prefer Phoenix Burrito House which is a better value and has tastier food! OK, I will say the sopapillas here are delicious. I'll give them that."
2,"If you're looking for a cheap place on the strip to stay, Excalibur is a good fit.  The rooms are decent, if older, and there's lots to do either in the hotel, or in neighboring hotels. The biggest part of going to Las Vegas is being out and about, so if you're just looking for a place to stay, you could definitely do worse than here.  \n\nPersonally, I also really enjoyed the Tournament of Kings dinner show.  It's pricey if you're not staying at the hotel, but with the room we got discounted tickets and it was a pretty fun experience for the price."
2,"There is a lot of street construction and hotel remodeling going on here, spring 2011, so very tough to give them any more than 3 stars.  The rooms are nice, the location is nice, but the detours, crazy elevator layout, and street construction keeps this from becoming a destination hotel.  But, I'm looking forward to returning in 2012 and updating my review."
0,"Upon entering, the place was empty. Should have been a clue. I was allowed to taste the chicken, and it was good. However, upon placing my order, I was disgusted. I watched as the lady called it back to the cook, who was putting food in his own mouth before licking his fingers. I IMMEDIATELY canceled my order and left. Such a shame that they're so nasty, because the food is good."
3,"Dropped in for lunch today and had a delicious meal.\n\nI ordered the boss sandwich, fries (per our server's recommendation) and a soda.\n\nThe sandwich was delicious, had a great flavor too it and the dressing was awesome. The bread was fresh and better that what I'm used to. And it was a nice, big portion. The fries were equally addictive and needless to say I had people picking them off my plate.\n\nThe service was great and the decor is cool. I could definitely see myself coming back for dinner or for a few beers. \n\nThe prices weren't bad either.\nMy only complaint is that we didn't come for dinner. From the looks of the dinner menu they have even better options at dinner time. We'll definitely come back."
4,"I had been dying to try Nittaya's after hearing about it from close friends.  I envisioned a small mom & pop place with just good food and was so surprised at this beautiful little oasis tucked away in an nicer than average strip mall in Summerlin.\n\nFrom the moment you step in to the zen/modern/Asian flair styled dining room, read from the beautifully bound menu til the time you finally push yourself away from the table, the experience is delightful in every way!\n\nMy friend's insisted we order 2 of the  world famous spinach salad (spinach leaves fried in tempura with lime dressing) which was like nothing I  have ever tasted before.  The leaves were light, airy & crispy and the dressing was tangy & the perfect compliment to the spinach. I ordered the Pad Thai.  It was so tasty and fragrant! My favorite pad thai in Vegas to date.  My one friend ordered the Lemongrass-Rubbed Cornish Game Hen which he proclaimed delicious although pretty spicy!  \n\nDid I mention the orange infused water?  \n\nI'll be back because I'm dying to sample more of their their  tasty sounding thai tapas and I'm already craving the spinach salad!"
4,Normally I don't like to go to famous restaurant . Coz I have never experience such good service and good food.\nBut this time was different..\n\nTwo thumbs up!\nService was Great and food was excellent for me.
4,"The class was excellent.The owner,Mike is very knowledgeable about all the subjects that he covers.He makes sure you understand everything that he covered in class and on the shooting range.The best class ever!"
4,"Gosh! I really wish I could carry an extra stomach or had a stomach the size of a hippo because there are so many options its ridiculous! I love that they portion everything out there for you that way you don't waste so much food. Because people suck at taking proper portions. It's either our eyes are hungrier than our stomach or we just grab big portions because we're scared someone will take the rest and when you get back theres none left for seconds (as if we didn't realize it was a buffet right?!?!) well...I did the brunch for father's day but the $30 brunch excluding the unlimited champagne (which is an additional $7) was still worth it. I mean if you're On a really boring date with someone at least you have the amazing interior design and contemporary art to entertain yourself with.The presentation was amazing. They were even put in cute little mini skillets and fryers. They were all so cute that I even ended up grabbing food I couldn't eat just because it looked too cute not to sit onmy plate. Their prime rib was tender, juicy, and full of flavor! They had steamed pork buns and yogurt. They had French fries and fried pickles. my favorite was the red velvet pancakes...mmmm amazing!!!! You have to eat it or I swear you should be banned from that buffet. Also the best part was the dessert section. They even had chocolate fudge and just Chocolate candy in anyway you think of itwas like willy wonka sponsored that dessert section. Anyway...go forth and experience it and if you don't then you can't really say you've experienced the buffets ever...."
3,I dig hanging out here. I am a fan of anything open all hours of the day. When you walk into Amelie's there is a homely feeling that makes me want to order half of the pastries from the case and post up in the living room (a personal fave chill spot) forever. I work here on occasion when the office walks start to wear on me. It's also a super good late night hang out after a show at the Evening Muse. A neighborhood gem.
2,"For our third night in Vegas, we headed to Mon Ami Gabi.  Now I wasn't quite as excited as my friends because we have one at home in Bethesda.  They sat our group in the patio room which had a great view of the Bellagio water show.  It was exceptionally dark though.. so much that we needed to pull out our cell phones to read the menu.  Mood lighting I suppose.  Our waiter was full on with the theme and right off the boat from France.  He might as well have been named Pierre, wore a beret and a little scarf, and had on a black and white striped shirt.  It was really too cute.  I was SUPER disappointed, however, when he told me that the only duck and lamb options were available on a single day of the week... not Saturday.  I considered having Chilean sea bass for a third night in a row, but instead went with the Seared Atlantic Salmon with pommes pur\u00e9e, mushrooms, pearl onions, red wine sauce for $19.95.  It was a great sized portion and they cooked the salmon to perfection (extremely rare).  My friends ordered the brie (which I'm never a fan of) and the mac and cheese for side dishes.  I was not impressed with the mac and cheese and stopped after a small bite.  It tasted like anything I could have made at home.  Nothing special.  My adorable waiter does get extra points for helping me to select a great wine that fit my taste buds.  He also explained the difference between French and South American Sauvignon Blanc.. complete with a map!  Dinner was great and I'd go back.. just in my hometown and go somewhere a little more unique for Vegas next time."
2,"CF must have seen it on a bad night.  I thought it was pretty darn funny and also, well acted.  Now, I agree that it has deviated away from Improv.  I think they had maybe 4 instances of improv during the hour or so show.  If you are there to specifically see improv, skip this one.  However, what was sketch comedy was pretty funny with several hilarious moments.  There was one sketch that I thought sucked which was the Imus skit, but other than that, funny stuff.  I would recommend this and in fact, would recommend getting the half price tickets at the mall."
1,Mediocre food probably a decent bar.
2,"I love seaweed salad every time I order it, but not at this restaurant. The seaweed was awful and the tofu was overwhelming. I had the vegetarian sushi, which was nothing special. Good cold sake. Buy the bottle, it's cheaper."
4,"I was in the area and needed a chiropractor. A friend of mine recommended I contact Dr. Meyers at the Palmer Center. Well, I can say I am sure glad I took the recommendation. I am very impressed with the facility and all they have to offer. In addition to the great chiropractic care I was given, they also have massage and rehab for particular cases. \n\nThey also have the top of the line spinal decompression machine called the DRX 9000 which is awesome. This is unique and not everyone has this machine because of its cost. The worked great for my low back pain and was what I needed.\n\nThanks so much for the great care you provided and I will recommend you guys to anyone in the area."
3,"The first time I came here was back when it first opened. The place was packed and the waitstaff were pretty disorganized. Luckily, the food was good. I had the pork & apple pie and enjoyed it, though wouldn't call it a must-have. \n\nI recently went back at a less busy hour. Had the fish & chips, which were delicious. I ordered their curry dipping sauce as an extra since I'd heard it was good, and indeed it was! \n\nMy friend and I were both happy with our food, but the service is still a bit shaky. There were periods where it felt like they were hurrying us along, and then just as easily it would seem like we'd been forgotten. Our waiter, though charming, was scattered and left my friend waiting to pay with her card until finally another waitress did it for us.  Still, the food is good and the atmosphere/clientele is thankfully not-Clyde's. If I had to change anything, I'd take down the damn TVs. I came here to socialize, not be constantly distracted by your big flat-screens."
2,"If you need something different to do with your kids, take them for the free circus acts.  It's like a super scaled back cirque du soleil.\n\nLayout here is harder to navigate than most. And the decor is creepy. Go with the circus tents and acrobats for a classier feel and lose the clowns. The outside looks like a giant paedo-trap."
0,"I will never eat at this location ever again. First of all it took well over 30 min to get our nachos. When we finally got them they were room temp and the cheese wasn't even melted!!  I sent them back and got attitude from the waitress.  We came at 4:30 pm mind you so I'm not sure why it took so long in the first place . The 2nd attempt at the nachos were better but this time they didn't drain the juice from the beans and it was really soggy! Really?! Finally the rest of our meal came and the fries were cold, hard and not a lot of flavor. They tasted like they had been sitting for quite awhile. We got our bill and I was shocked to see we were being billed for the nachos. I couldn't believe they had the nerve to charge me for them when I complained about them twice! I think got up and asked to speak to the manager. The manager comes over and I explain why I felt I shouldn't have to pay for the nachos. She then begins to argue with me about the length  I had to wait for the nachos. Wait. What? Is she serious? ! Finally she says she will remove them from my bill....she leaves for a few minutes and then comes back to our table and then says to me..we are able to check ticket times and I didn't even let her finish her sentence at that point. I was shocked that she'd come back to tell me that! !! I said are you really coming back over here to argue with me about the time it took? ??  At that point I said just give me the bill since we were already making a big scene.  Why would this manager fill the need to fight me on this?  I will never be back to an Islands.  Besides that, the hamburger my friend ordered looked disgusting!  It didn't even look like fresh hamburger meat. I WILL NEVER BE BACK."
4,"Finally.\nThis is the kind of Yelp event that I've been waiting for. As much as I love eating with my fellow Yelpers, working out with them is even more fun.  \n\nA bunch of us did a free Dethrone Basecamp workout, which their website describes as: \n\""... a whirlwind of 30 1-minute exercises. It starts with one fast-paced minute on the Airdyne Bike. Then one minute off, doing an intense weight or bodyweight exercise. Then it's back on the Airdyne for another minute. Then another minute off. Repeat this cycle for 30 rounds. Top that off with some abs and core exercises at the end and you've got yourself an exhilarating, calorie calorie burning, body-toning, muscle building Basecamp Workout.\""\n\nAnd, that's what we did.  I shared a bike with Niyen because we're about the same height.  The group was split up in A, B, C, and D groups, with half of each group on the bikes to start and the other half doing the assigned exercise for one minute on the exercise floor in front of the bikes. So, for example, I started on the bike for one minute while Niyen did the exercise assigned to our Group A, push-ups.  I rode for a minute and he did push-ups for a minute, then we switched, so he rode the bike and I did push-ups. The other groups had different exercises, but we all eventually did the same ones in the rotation. This continued for 30 minutes, with exercises that included box jumps, burpees, jumping lunges, medicine ball squats, TRX flyes and bicep curls, and deadlifts.  We then did 10 minutes of ab/core work on the floor together.  \n\nI don't normally do these types of exercises or classes, so I greatly appreciate the opportunities to step outside the box this month with Yelp Fit Club.  A big fat thank you goes out to Drew and Victoria for organizing this excellent event as well as to Dethrone Basecamp for hosting our group; I burned off at least one cronut last night."
1,I have been a regular there since they are the only one that has authentic Taiwanese style food. But I gotta say that they really don't have any service there and the quality is good is never consistent. The server there is always rude even if you speak Chinese. My girl friend and I have been really upset about their service not only once. They really need to work on a lot of things to survive in the industry.
3,"4.5 stars for Fiamma. I'd heard good things from a trusted foodie, and read all my fellow Yelper's reviews. I went here for my bday dinner celebration with 13 people. We waited for our table in a lounge area near the bar with an glass encased fireplace and modern couches. Had a lime martini - first one was pretty good and light on the simple syrup. The second one, not so much. Way too sweet, but was easily fixed by the bartender.\n\nFiamma has the multiple server thing going on, almost to the point of confusion. Hmmm who should we ask for drinks, food...??? We were presented with the \""bottled\"" or \""still\"" water question, to which my sister stupidly said \""still.\"" For a table of 13, imagine the number of dollars, ca-ching! The table bread was odd for an Italian restaurant, it was closer to an Indian naan. It was good, but just odd. The menu had so many great sounding choices, it was hard to pick! \n\nWhat 3 of us decided on:\n\nRAVIOLINI\nShort Rib Ravioli, Barbera Wine\nImported Pecorino Romano \n\nSPAGHETTI\nFresh Cut Chitarra Spaghetti\nKobe Meatballs, San Marzano Pomodoro \n\nAGNOLOTTI\nPiemonte Ravioli, Imported Bufala Ricotta\nSpinach, Crushed Pomodori Pelati \n\nYum, yum, and yum. We sampled each other's food. Spaghetti was definitely homemade. Raviolini was great. The Agnolotti was what I ordered and it was my favorite. Being a cheeseaholic, I loved of this dish. \n\nWe got two birthday desserts but that was disappointing. I'd ordered the CIOCCOLATO: triple chocolate cake, godiva ganache, white chocolate gelato, berry gelatina, but it never made its way to the table. Instead they delivered the CROCHETTE: crispy amaretti doughnuts, chocolate ganache, dolce di latte, cinnamon glaze, which I definitely could have left. I wasn't even hungry come dessert time, but I thought it was on the house for the birthday and I figured I'd share it.  Alas, they charged for the desserts. Ridiculous even though I hadn't even wanted those little chocolate donut holes (which were not amazing at all). But after some coaxing, the server (rightfully) removed the charge. Next time, I shall get my Cicollato!!!"
3,The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is this place is the hole in the wall.  Pretty much the hole was made by a wrecking ball.  The food is awesome and and very tasty and authentic.  Don't expect too much on view.
2,"I would rate this 3 1/2 stars. It's good, especially the ceviche and small plates, but we went late in the evening, around 8:15pm and they start clearing the food at 9:15pm so I don't think we got the cream of the crop or even all the dishes they offered for the night. And it was $44 a person. The sushi was so-so, think they might have had more selection earlier in the evening. Desserts were plentiful, with gelato and ice cream, pastries and mousses, and chocolate covered strawberries. Maybe for a cheaper price and more selection, it would be more impressive."
3,"in town for a conference and craving 'real food'/a substantial breakfast to start the day - breakfast club, walking distance to our hotel, completely delivered.  our server was super friendly, though we were sleepy and indecisive; she recommended the french toast side we ordered to be made ala bananas foster - YUM.  more like dessert but nothing wrong with dessert for breakfast...  otherwise we had fairly standard egg dishes but they were yummy, fresh, served quickly, and exactly what we needed.\n\nthe *only* complaint i have is wayfinding - perhaps, since they were setting up for an event downstairs, it was moved - but there were ZERO signs on ground level, and while we could smell bacon/coffee/breakfast, we had to lap the block a few times and only found it because we figured we may as well try the escalator...  a few signs would go far."
3,I would call it a 4.5 star. It's not quite a five star restaurant but it's close. Table was ready at the exact time of our reservation which is always nice.  Great waiter and fabulous bus boy.  Service was quick but not rushed feeling. Prices are reasonable for what you get. We had the jumbo stone crab and enjoyed them. Very meaty and easy to eat. We also had a few side dishes. Asparagus and hash browns with grilled onions were both excellent.  Nice wine list as well.
3,"This is actually one of the nicest Life Time gyms in the country (I have been to many of them)... and it is also one of the least expensive (compared to the membership fees at the other Life Time gyms).  With that said, before moving to AZ, I was a member of a high end club located in downtown Chicago and paid less... so yes, LTF is expensive compared to some other options out there.  I think the membership fee is up to $54/month now.\n\nHowever, they have very nice amenities including basketball courts, indoor and outdoor pools with water slides, child care with hours seven days a week, cafe, wireless internet, and a salon.   \n\nThey also have plenty of free yoga, cycling, and activity classes available.\n\nOverall, I'm addicted to going to this gym and won't consider going elsewhere (well, until the monthly fee gets over $60)."
0,"Zero stars = total rip-off !\n\nDecor and ambiance just so-so.  Service is only average; staff seemed inexperienced (not counting stints at McDonald's or Burger King).\n\nMake sure you have eaten and stopped by an ATM before your arrival.\n\nMenu and items are all way over priced, portions are ultra-tiny. \nThe roaches in this place are fed better than the patrons.\n\nThe single scallop they used to construct  an appetizer seemed to be \nformed using a surgical laser which yielded 6 slices the thickness of a human hair."
3,We always try to go to Firefly at least once on our Vegas jaunts.  Reservations are a must as the place fills up with mostly the younger crowd.  I love bringing new people here to show that some Vegas places can still make awesome food for low prices.  The parking can be hit or miss when it is busy.  I haven't tried Drangonfly next door yet - next visit I guess.
2,"For a hotel restaurant, surprisingly tasty and interesting food! The first night I had the standard steak  cooked well, with great fries. And I had a side of green beans, which came with chopped hazelnuts. Interesting  not my style  but credit for the creativity. Something which is lacking in pretty much any other hotel restaurant.\nThe second night I had a fish soup, which was OK  was expecting chunks of fish inside but there were none, and the soup was a bit too liquid-y. I also had the squid risotto, which was amazing though. Just perfectly done.\nI would have given 4 stars, but it is at hotel prices.\nThe London Insider\n\nhttp://www.london-insider.co.uk/"
0,This place is a joke. I admit my daughter & husband wanted to try it again for the shark week themed ice cream but that was a big fat no! They refused my cisaves app mobile redemption due to the fact they only accept print outs! Called to complain to the manager who sounded way to young to be manager said well that's what corporate said is that we can only take print outs. Even though they accept campus apps and has their logo on the door! Prints out are a waste of time & paper. And a waste of gas to drive to campus town. Good thing I left there and spent my money well worth it Jarling.
3,"This is my go-to spot for late night eating.  Fortunately it's close to my house, so I can satiate the post-drinking munchies that inevitably happen. The staff is friendly and quick, and the prices are unbeatable.  \n\nI don't like a rut; always having \""the usual\"" at a restaurant, but the Cook Out Style burger is what always drags me in.  I can't pass up that cheese, chili and onions.  My lady had the cheddar and bacon burger in a recent late night adventure to Cook Out and she gave it rave reviews.  I only got to gnaw on a tiny piece of bacon, but it was enough to make me want to try it the next time I'm hungry for some grease."
2,"Not bad. Stopped in to grab some take-out Chicken Tikka Masala and Naan. The sauce was very good, as was the naan, but the chicken \""felt\"" as though it might be under-cooked. I was surprised that I didn't get any rice or anything with the tikka masala, just a tub of chicken in sauce.\n\nI'll happily give them another try though, when I have time to eat in."
1,"I wanted to like this place, because it's close, but the sushi was just OK. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The server didn't know what Ponzu sauce was... That may have been our first clue. The sushi chef did, though, and dunking our sushi into ponzu made it better. \n\nThe fish could have been a bit fresher, the seaweed a bit less tough, and the rice a little more fluffy and sticky. \n\nThe edamame, however, was top-notch. Service was pretty attentive. I'd go back to try the hibachi, but the sushi didn't do it for me. The search will continue!"
1,"Good Ole Rabbie Burns! or not...as in the case of the tourist Cafe on the Royal Mile. The name may be appealing, but trust me - thats the extent of its appeal. Yeah ok, it's a pleasant place, nice and clean and a reasonable layout but the overall experience leaves a lot to be desired, I'm afraid to say...\n\nYou can tell it's aimed at tourists as the menu has a quaint Scottish twist, such as 'a wee rolly' and 'haggis and mare haggis' . Being a local, I avoid these places like the plague. I generally try to avoid the Royal Mile, but I can understand its appeal for visitors.\n\nthe menu of Rabbie Burns isn't exactly extensive, don't expect fois gras and terrine of duck. More like...4 cheese panini and Macaroni Cheese. Yeah, don't get me wrong, if you're looking for a quick, cheap bite to eat while catching all the sights then Rabbie Burns is your place...but if you want something a little bit more exciting there are a plethora of places lined along the same street as the cafe which would fill the whole a lot better"
3,"Durants is old school cool. The lighting, red wallpaper, and wood paneling are the perfect combination. It's not Scottsdale sheik, it's above it. If Sinatra wanted a great cocktail, he would come here. \n\nGuys order a real drink like a martini up or a Manhattan and you won't be disappointed. They have a great wine selection and even offer the majority of it by the glass. \n\nThe food is unassuming, but good. Your steak isn't going to be overdressed or or over cooked, but just right. The oysters, when in season are almost the best in town."
3,Pei Wei Combo!  Need I say more?  :)
2,Ok. Not amazing but my girlfriend really likes it.
1,"Been here many times for breakfast, the place is a zoo, but it is sort of a controlled chaos, but tonight it was just a write off. I don't know if they were short staffed, but a quick coffee, turned into 20 minutes, then we were told to go stand in line again (10 deep) at 7pm?!?  Extremely slow service, so if you want a quick coffee in the evening go somewhere else, but they seem to have morning coffee figured out!  Of course the parking is the usual :("
3,The tres leches dessert is phenomenal.\n\nThe guacamole is kinda bland and the salts served with the nachos are fun. The chile relleno is unacceptable.\n\nDiego should be really happy that the tres leches is so damn good.
2,"I'd seen this place for awhile ago and had been wanting to try it. I didn't go, my friend picked up lunch, so this is just a review on the food. I had the filafel wrap. It was good but not great, especially for the price. The onions were a little excessive and I had a hard time distinguishing different flavors over that. I've had worse filafels but I've definitely had better, at least outside of vegas."
3,"Great food, great service, fantastic hot wings! \n\nIt was a little loud, but we were there on a game night. The drinks, though pricey were great!"
0,"Pathetic car wash. If you want good service, value for your money go to another car wash. They left patches of dirt on the tires, body and on the bumper. Even after complaining to the so called \""Manager\"", nothing happened. I paid for the VIP car wash. Left disappointed. Will never go back. Stay away from this car wash."
0,"The Good\n\nThe Hostess and Waitress seemed nice and the place is cute modern neat and clean .\n\nThe Bad\n\nBread basket contained squishy bread (Italians don't eat this kind of bread) but they do get a point for adding an herb and salting the top .\n\n pizzetta (margarita) I don't know how to describe but the crust had that very similar taste to frozen pizzas not even like a bad pizza out and unripe roma tomatoes were placed on top , the addition of some fresh basil topped the pie but didn't save it from tasting sort of cardboard like this was not tasty and after a bite or two we didn't feel like eating more .\n\nHerb roasted salmon tasted farm raised and was cooked to approx well done not sure about herbs but it tasted like salt pepper and garlic just a notch better than salmon off an Asian Buffet . This salmon ($15.75) dinner only came with what I think was the frozen broccoli cauliflower carrot mix you can always taste frozen especially in the broccoli . If I had this same meal in a food court at the mall  I'd say it was OK for a food court meal but even fresh vegetables are served at Panda Express and I don't intentionally go out to eat and pay for meals that are far lower quality than what I'd eat at home .\n\nMy husband had the penne pepperonata and he thought his peppers were raw and said the sauce tasted like crushed tomatoes out of a can without seasoning also the pasta was gooey and over done .\n\n\nI do feel sick and sad for who ever owns this place and I hope they aren't like this all the time .\nI hope they get help from someone on how to prepare better food .\nLast Night was our first visit here but even Wild Horses would not be able to drag us back for a second visit .\n\nas a slight update the owner contacted me and said I was a \""mudslinger\"" and he said I HAD A GOAL in saying something awful about his place...Gosh I don't know what I set wrong in my Yelp for not getting his message posted.\n\nI am NOT endorsing not to visit his place.....\n\nhe didn't say anything about what I said about the food. \nmaybe I was there when they weren't at their best?\nmaybe we've ordered what they do least well?\nand maybe? they've improved since...I hope so\ngive them a try......\n\nI don't know what to say to the owner other than that.\nalso I will mention now...that I left out we took our unfinished pizza home and it was packed sent to us all stuck together so I had to throw it out...I wanted to retry in case I was too harsh but as I said before they had unripe tomatoes that day so it didn't taste good and the dough I think might be frozen or a mix?"
0,"I went to the happy valley location with my daughter to get our hair cut.  My daughter got her cut from Jennifer and I had the displeasure of Philip.  They were both extremely rude and unprofessional. Philip even had the audacity to tell me \""this is Supercuts and im not here to make money for my pocket, its for the customers pocket!\"". all I did was ask if I could have a shampoo and hair dry.  I will never go there again and hope they can either find better staff or train the current staff on customer courtesy and professionalism. It's an embaressment to the neighborhood."
4,"One of my favorites, I love this place.  Been going here for years and when friends and family come to town we head to Ellis Island.   The steak special is fabulous for $4.95, I always order a salad with mine and I love the fact they add enough dressing to cover the whole salad.  I usually play the Keno machine and have won twice 8 out of 9 in the last few months.\nIf you sign up for a players card, you get coupons in the mail every month for the meals 2 for 1, plus checks.  \nIf your looking for a good price, down to earth fun this is the place to go."
2,Typical BofA but at least there is never a huge crowd here.
4,"I'm in from out of town for USA Volleyball Nationals. Over the last few days my right knee had developed really painful tendonitis. Through a referral I found Jesse, he made room in his schedule to see me.\n\nJesse made me hurt in new and unusual ways. I left his shop with the ability to move my knee freely without pain or restriction. He does absolutely amazing work.\n\nIf I lived in Phoenix, I would be a regular customer. \n\nThanks Jesse! Now lets see about bringing home a gold medal..."
4,"I said I'd give them another chance, and I did. SO I went for my scheduled service today.  The overall communication is really good, price are fair and they added a smart showroom.  Here it is they got their 5th star back!  You can trust Dain to take care of your smart service."
3,Pretty nice if small modern art museum and architecturally somewhat intereresting. The restrooms have a cool design. It only takes about an hour to look at everything but at $8 it is relatively reasonable. I saw the Giacometti exhibit here it was quite well arranged and documented. Be sure to walk out on the second floor balcony to check out the sculptures there and the view of the immediate area of downtown
0,"Very disappointed.  I'm not sure if all the other reviews are family or have never had anything but boxed cupcakes. Which I have had better cupcakes from a box.  None of the cupcakes looked very appetizing.  They were very dense and so was the frosting, which tasted like lard. The banana cupcakes was not made with real bananas, but banana flavoring. Gross!  I'm not sure what the strawberry shortcake or Madagascar were made of, but they were flavorless. We could not finish are cupcakes and we definitely will not be returning. Oh and the older lady smiled a lot but the younger lady who helped us was very short with us and gave us the feeling that we were bothering her. I also hurt my finger trying to get a soda out because a sign was leaning on the side and caught my finger when I pulled the door open."
1,"The food was good but OVERPRICED.  The setup was exactly like the old spot.  I thought the old location forced them into a cramped space but apparently,  they like it that way.  Service was good.  The $12 specialty margaritas DID NOT produce a buzz and I COULD NOT taste the tequila. Yes, I SAID IT, 12 DOLLARS!!  (Pint size with ice)  I guess if i order a $12 drink, I expect to taste some liquor in it and it should probably come in a giant margarita glass, like at Arriba's.  I think that the owners are cheap and trying to lure a snooty crowd that likes to show their friends how to properly waste some perfectly good money!!!  I had been to the old location several times.  Won't find me coming back to the new location though.  You've failed to retain an old customer.  Oh,  and the valet parking is just irritating. I walked out and there's my car, parked 20 feet away, and I gotta wait for the guy to get it for me?  All those blue cones are enough to piss ya off!!  What other place in Phoenix is like this?  I had a hard time finding my way out!!"
4,"Best birthday ever, came here for my 21st to see Tiesto and I couldn't have spent it another way. My girlfriend and I had a blast. Only downside is it's always packed, literally like a can of sardines. People bumping into you at all times. Tip, get table service. Totally worth it."
0,"so very disappointed. bellagio used to be one of my favorite vegas buffets, and now it has been reduced to the worst on my list.\n\nthe variety was simply lacking. and worst of all, the quality was abysmal. there was nothing that i wanted to eat, and everything that i did eat was sub-par at best. i was stunned at the fact that the carving station only offers medium or well-done prime rib. it was far too overcooked for my taste, and the carver was rude and unskilled. after asking multiple times to slice the prime rib thinly, he continued to carve 2 inch thick slices to patrons. everyone was frustrated with the carver, his rudeness, and just the appalling waste of food because he was incapable of slicing anything less than a size of a brick.\n\nanother shocking discovery was the installation of soft serve machines and the disappearance of hand scooped gelato. this utterly disgusted me and was the final nail in the coffin. who the hell wants drippy icy ooze that melts the minute it hits the bowl? it was worse than the local sizzler.\n\nand there is an average wait of 45 minutes for this atrocity? no thanks."
4,"My favorite dive bar in Vegas. It has alot of character and charm with a wide selection of craft beer and delicious Mexican fare next door at Tacos Feliz (they share space). Stan's the owner/bartender and he's the coolest cat. Tell him he looks like Busta Rhymes stunt double, lol. Thursdays and Fridays are open mic and local Vegas musicians. Scensters and hipsters come crawling out of the woodworks for the debauchery and entertainmet and girls with piecings and tattoos drape the bar with their  presence. \n\nCome thru, the 1st beer is on you."
4,Went for a friends birthday and had a blast! The show was fantastic and the people in the show even came out after to take pics with everyone! I would see it again.
1,"Came here every morning for breakfast while staying at Mandalay Bay. They have a to-go section which offered a selection of fruits, breads, donuts, sandwiches, coffee, etc.\n\nThe bagels are decent too. Whole grain, poppy seed, original and raisin. They also offer flavored cream cheese such as honey walnut, strawberry, veggie and blueberry. \n\nFruit cups are fresh and the fruit were sweet and crunchy everytime. I hope they were changed out every morning. Overall, this place is a great grab and go to start the morning off."
2,"Delicious food overshadows poor inattentive service. My party of four waited nearly 40 minutes today(Friday morning) and when we were finally seated our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink order. After that, service was slow and had poor follow up. Forget trying to get a coffee cup refilled(I got up and went near the kitchen window to get a refil). \n  The good news is that the omelette and egg scrambles are delicious and large.  Homemade breads are wonderful. Our meals were delivered by some other team member and we never saw our waitress again until it was time for a check.  No follow up!!! Management may think the team approach is fine but someone, ie the primary waitress, needs to maintain some degree of attention to the table once food has been served.\nWhen we were leaving we mentioned this to our waitress and she just shrugged her shoulders and thanked us for coming...wow!\nI must reiterate how good the food is...We will return again because of that fact."
2,"I went here for lunch and its a cool place, totally like the decor. The service was good. My girlfriend got the lunch special with salad, soup, rice, and chicken. She loved it, I tried the chicken thought it was plain with no seasoning but cooked perfect and was moist and crunchy. I had them make me a sushi roll. It was very good but I thought it was small in size. If it was bigger I would have given 4 stars. The roll I had them make was shrimp tempura, cream cheese, jalapeno, topped with yellow tail. Overall I do like this place, sushi wise I have had better but I did like it. I will be back, glad to have a sushi place in this area!"
3,"I didn't know that this place existed until today when I accidentally missed the entrance to Asiana Market and drove on.  If I knew earlier, I would have totally ditched Lee Lee long time ago.  This place is clean, new, and has fresh products. Oh and the fish are not just FRESH but they have VARIETY.  They actually filet/fry fish for you at the station like they do in the Cali markets.  \n\n*Store = Clean, NEW\n*Groceries = FRESH, VARIETY of fish\n*Service = GOOD\n*Location = ~2min from Asiana Market and ~10min from Lee Lee."
4,"Linda is AMAZING, not only is she an amazing person but she is also awesome at scar revisions.  I have a dog bite scar from 1996 that went all the way to the bone that I am self-conscious about.  I saw a crazy deal on Living Social for skin needling, WHAT??? I had no idea what that even was but after talking to Linda on the phone for 20 minutes I felt confident that she could help, at least, make the scar less noticeable. She never made promises that I felt like she could not keep, as in, she said it would be invisible or it would disappear, etc.  We are talking about a deep, old scar.  However, my scar looks AMAZING after 4 treatments.  It is flat, smaller and the discoloration is on the way to being gone.  I am beyond impressed with how it looks. I AM THRILLED! I get comments all the time from people that know me and say \""Is there something different?\"", it's crazy!!!\nNow that we have covered the skin needling, let's talk about the other services Linda offers.  Along with the skin needling that Linda performed, she treated my whole face to make sure my scar treatment was getting the best chance to work.  Skin scraping and all over face treatment.  My skin looks and feels amazing.  I have not ever been this happy with how my skin looks and feels.  I have less wrinkles, less middle age acne break outs and the texture of my skin is amazing.  \nLinda never over sells products or pushes things on you, so you never feel like you \""have to buy what she uses on you\"" like you do at some salons you visit.  She is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet and she will be honest about what she can and can not do to help you.  I really appreciated that when we started working on my scar.  I truly appreciated all her hard work and how my scar looks now!!\n\nThank you Linda and Scottsdale Skin Needling!! Amazing place and amazing business!!"
0,I am so upset to come here and place such a large order late at night with no one really there so obviously it shouldn't be that hard to get the order right. \n\nIt's another fast food spot that you don't expect customer service from but the least they could do is get the order right. I call to speak to a manager who Ofcourse doesn't speak English that well and if she does she sure didn't sound like it on the phone.  \n\nAs she sat there telling me what she did to our order I'm explaining to her that it's wrong with missing items she talks over me to correct me. I will never understand how such people are hired to run a store. I'll be calling again in the morning in hopes I talk to someone who understands customer issues.
3,Shaded Canyon Trailhead part of Amargosa Trail has a few picnic benches and bike racks to park your bicycles.  Nice view of the Strip too from here.  Just heed the warning signs.  Gravel can be slippery and there are some dips and sharp twists along this trail ...and most importantly please bring water with you.  It's crazy how I've run into people w/o bottled water along the way.
3,"Great addition to Monti's... Needs a better name... Put \""Hayden's\"" above the back bar in rustic lettering or something!  This is one of the few old places left in the valley... \""Hayden's Front Porch\"" would generate interest in the awesome story of this location and pioneer family."
0,"I stopped in for lunch last Friday and ordered a Teriyaki bowl. There was one other party in the restaurant besides me. That should have given me a clue right there. The person who took my order was decent. I got the order rather quickly. It tasted good but when I got down to the end I was very shocked. I took a look at a 3\"" strip of chicken I was saving just to check it out. Well there was some chicken but mostly fat and grissle. I put it back into the bowl and threw it away. That is something I would throw away and not serve to anyone. I thought what are these people thinkin serving something like this to someone. Please avoid this restaurant no matter what you want to eat."
3,"Scottsdale Fashion Square houses department stores such as Nordstrom, Dillard's, Neiman Marcus and Macy's.  They have a huge food court, sit-down restaurants, and a movie theater.  The roof is retractable!"
2,"This hotel is middle of the road; not the best but not the worst either.  The room was not very impressive at all.  The ipod dock did not work and the shower did not drain well.  They really need to add more outlets to allow for phones to be plugged in near the beds.  Also, no mini fridge so bring a cooler. \n\nHowever, it was very clean and the overall hotel was better than some of the rest in Vegas.  If you are looking for a clean place to stay in Vegas that is on the cheaper side, stay here.  If you are looking for a nicer room...I would skip."
0,"Are you kidding me? Couldn't believe that I was excited about this place. I guess there is something for everyone, but this was not for me! No stars really."
3,"If you're staying at the Cosmopolitan anyway, this is a great place for breakfast.  Delicious French toast, tasty breakfast burritos, and an excellent bloody Mary with a strip of bacon and chipotle infused vodka (the kind of bloody Mary that you eat! yum). \n\nIt was the perfect way to get our vacation started."
1,Food is good. Says they're open until midnight on Saturdays but I just tried walking in at 9:30 and they told me the kitchen was closed. Bogus
4,"Green Valley Tint was recommended to me from a friend who recently used them for window tinting on her car.  Always willing to visit a word-of-mouth suggestion I thought I'd give them a try when I finally broke down and decided that I would like a little shielding from the sun in my own car.  The front desk staff was friendly, they brought me right in and were done within the timeframe quoted, and the tint job looks great.  Plus, the price was about 25% less than I was expecting, bonus!  Cheers to feeling less like a frying egg when traveling in summer!"
3,"I had to go shopping at the Forum Shops for some new clothes. The wife and I stopped in at the Palm for some dinner. \n\nThere are two seating options: inside or patio. Now the patio isn't outside, it's just in the Forum shops. The patio is fun for people watching, but be cautioned in that it can be loud out there and if you want to chat it's not the best option.\n\nWe were seated promptly and had bread and water delivered very quickly. The staff seemed very attentive and efficient. \n\nI opted for a Filet Mignon. My wife, who eats here for lunch quite a bit, asked for the Lobster Roll, which is on the lunch menu but not for dinner. They were able to accommodate her request.\n\nFor cocktails, I ordered a \""Simply Nectar\"", which is a Jack Daniels version of a Mojito. Frankly, it was great and I boosted the review by a star just because of the quality cocktail.\n\nDinner came and it was fantastic. The Filet was cooked exactly to specifications and the Lobster Roll was perfect. \n\nOverall, a great dinner and cocktails."
1,Went with another couple and you would of thought we had a disease or something.  Just wasn't couple friendly at all.  Drinks were not worth what you paid for them $20 for a beer and mixed drink in a SMALL glass.  I guess you get what you pay for. We paid $10 a person for the privilege of being snubbed.  Dancers if you want to earn money act like you want to be there and see everyone not just those you think you will make more money. I've been to better strip clubs and will make sure to take my business there.
0,"Was there today to get a small dinette set.   The salesman had the NERVE to take a call on his cell and proceeded to blast his co-workers by ethnicity, I kid you not.  I guess I didn't look like a spending customer.  Jokes on you Mr. Mustache, today was payday. You did not and will not get a red penny of it."
1,"Very disappointing!!  We went there wanting to try burgers, bloody marys and bacon wrapped jalapenos!  The bacon wrapped jalapenos aren't even on the  menu!  Not a LOT of bacon items either.\n\nWe walked in, waited a few minutes and were brought menus.  We didn't place a drink menu right then, as we wanted to see the special options. (about 4 over-priced bloody mary's were it).  There were maybe 5 or 6 other people in the place...early Saturday evening.\n\nWe never saw the bartender again, well actually we did...talking on her cell phone.  After waiting about 15 minutes we left.  AND...won't be back!"
1,"Well, I gave it a shot...twice... before writing this review.  My co-worker mentioned seeing this place a while back and when I saw the Groupon, I decided I'd give it a try.  I got the cobb salad the first time and it was eh.  The second time I went I made my own chopped salad and they forgot the artichoke hearts and totally skimped on the turkey (which you pay extra for).  My salad was super overdressed and pretty soggy by the time I got back to my office (which is 2 blocks away).  The service is slow and there seems to be a lot of confusion behind the counter.  I understand that it hasn't been there more than a couple months but really...get your shit together.   A $10 salad isn't worth this nonsense!"
4,"the apple crisp pizza desert.   gotta be the best pizza ever.   wow love it.   wife says we can't buy pizza anymore unless we get this apple pizza.\nfyi:   my opinion....even without the apple pizza, this is the best pizza joint in charlotte"
0,"100% MOVING NIGHTMARE!!!!    I told the owner that I have a 3 bedroom home that needs to be moved. Everything was packed in boxes and moved into the garage except a few large items.  The owner agreed to charge me $245 for the first FOUR HOURS +$84.00 an hour after that. The owner also agreed to include shrink wrap, and dropping off a few items to my new place with no charge. The movers arrived at my house at 8:30am in a UHAUL truck fit for a 1  1/2 bedroom house.  The unexperienced and unprofessional movers had to take 2 trips. The second owner still agreed to give me the same price with no additional charge for their fault of bringing a small truck. The drive is 45 minutes per trip from the storage space to the home.   At the beginning of the 2nd trip, the movers asked ME to go to the store and get them something to drink. I really did not feel comfortable leaving strangers with my personal belongings with no supervision. I did not want them to pass out in the heat. Even though they should have been drinking water, I took a chance and went to the store to go get a blue PowerAde and Dr. Pepper at their request.  I took a photo of the license plate on the UHAUL truck. I hurried back. Time as passed and they are close to filling up the truck the second time. Once again, the truck is filling up FAST! My washer, dryer, treadmill and refrigerator along with other large items are still not on the truck. One of the movers was annoyed  and begins to tell the other mover that he hates his boss (the owner) for giving them a small truck.  One of the mover's proceeds to call the office, but no one answers for about  1/2 an hour. Once they finally answer, I see the movers closing the truck without the remainder of my items on the truck! I ask them what is happening. They replied by saying they were going back and get a BIGGER TRUCK.    They left WITH MY ITEMS on that truck and headed to the downtown area were the office was.  They left  at 4pm and came back at 6pm. When the movers arrived at 6pm to finish the job,  IT WAS THE SAME TRUCK, BUT  DIFFERENT MOVERS! They finally finished after 8pm. By this time, my storage unit is closed so they had to keep my items OVERNIGHT!  They gave me a new price of $500! I could not believe this was happening.  I was being swindled!  The owner told the movers that she wanted me to pay the $245 right now and pay the remainder of the balance tomorrow morning when they dropped off my items at the storage unit and wanted me to sign a document stating that I would do that. I refused to sign anything that I did not agree to.  One of the movers agreed that it was wrong the way I was treated. I let them take my items to their office over night. The mover said he would personally deliver my items to the storage space 1st thing the next morning. Once the mover showed up the next morning, he showed me some paper work that one of the owners put together for me to sign and pay the balance. THEY WANTED TO KEEP MY STUFF UNTIL I PAID DOUBLE OF WHAT WAS AGREED!  I still refused.  I was going to call the authorities. The mover stopped me and said squash it. After 24 hours of moving, they unloaded my items into the storage unit. I too afraid to have them drop a few of my things to my new place so I did not ask. I still gave the movers tips.  I don't see them staying in business by using movers with no experience and giving promises and not following through with them. SO GLAD THAT HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE IS OVER!"
3,"Normally I like to order an item from a menu without making many changes to the dish - especially if I have not had it before. I like to try it as the chef intended. In this case I decided to add their mole sauce to my dish that was not supposed to come with it.  I was glad I did - the mole made the dish. It was great, and everything tasted fresh and homemade. What made my meal was the skinny margarita I had.  I never had a \""skinny\"" margarita but I generally don't like how sweet regular margs are, so I gave it a try. It was amazing, and I have not had a better one since.  It was very expensive - so after I saw the price on the bill I was a bit shocked, but it was worth it.  It was quite strong too."
0,"Where do I start, What a Horrible experience.... Talk about high blood pressure. I WILL NEVER GO BACK... \n\nMy father goes all the time and I decided to go with him. I have been in the pass but I said it was not worth the wait. But he wanted to go.. So it was a good father/daughter bonding. We arrived at the clinic and as usual long lines. They stated it was an 1 1/2 hour wait. We both asked for gender preference. I do not feel comfortable with a man and either does my father. They said no but my father stated that we just skip to the next female when we are there, as he has done in the pass. \n\nWe waited longer than an hour and watched people get called 3-4 times and when they came back from where ever they were put 1st on the list. So when my name was called I had a male, I went up and asked to skip, they guy said NO. I said they did it in the pass. He said to go up front and talk to the manager, I said NO. He showed me that you can get female preference with pre-approved and people actually had female preference interesting.... The manager came to us and PULLED us into his OFFICE like Kindergarten children. He did not handle the situation like taking care of us right then and there!!!!!!!!!!!   WOW as I got more and more upset, we did get female preference. He gave us reasons which did not make sense but that is the way he is going to run this business, I do not want to participate. All of this could of been taken care of if the front entrance had better verbiage such as asking if we have been there before and given us the rules. We would not of stayed. \n\nI will say my student therapist Jennifer was fantastic. My father did enjoy his therapist, but I would not recommend this place ever again unless they allow preference!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nGood luck with running the weekend massage school but POOR business tactics. \n\nYes and good luck to everyone that goes sits in a sweatbox room with people sick and coughing, nasty... NOT WORTH 32 dollars for 2 people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"My tandem-mate and I took our \""bicycle made for two\"" here for a standard tune-up since we hadn't had one since we bought the bike. \n\nThe staff (owner maybe?) was very friendly and knowledgeable about our bike: an example, he told us that Shimano, the maker of our tandem, was notorious for poor gears. Our bike did, in fact, have a hard time shifting gears. But when we picked it back up he fixed them!\n\nThe Golden Spoke is a great place for a cheap tune-up (only $40!). The service will take a couple of days, but it is well worth the wait!"
1,"This place has definitely gone down. I ordered a panini, and it was a sad, sad panini. Basically, a toasted sandwich. My boyfriend ordered the \""New York Yankee\"" and it was sub-par and dry. We both didn't finish our half orders. To be fair, the salad bar was decent, and the broccoli and cheddar soup was fine. We will not be returning."
3,I live 3 minutes away from Ricardo's and I went on my birthday a couple weeks ago. The food was pretty alright but the what really sold me was their cocktails. They have a great variety and I got some coconut margaritas . Those were surprisingly good! My server was great and helpful when it came down to choosing drinks. I'll be back ! :))
4,"I love, love, love this sushi! I can't always dine in so it is good to know you can call in an order and pick it up, easy peesy! The food is fresh, the service is fantastic, and it is a great place to take people visiting Vegas!"
3,"The steeper the bill becomes, the better the food is ??? \n\nIn this instance, it is correct. With the bill coming out to about $250 for four people. We sure got our monies worth. We ordered a plethora or goodies. Everything was great in its own righteousness. We also shared a carafe of sangria which wasn't too bad and topped off with the olive oil ice cream.. yumm.\n\nIt's a tapas place so everything comes in small portion, though each plate is an average of $12/ea. It's worth it. You have to try the chicken frittatas that comes in a shoe!\n\nWorth the experience. \n\nA more detail list of how everything went will follow."
1,"Aldi's seems to have changed its operation since my childhood in Indiana. Back in the day Aldi was a small store with only 2 employees (deliberately) working in the store. One ran the register while the other stocked the floor and the line was always suuuuuuuuuper long.\n\nAnyhow I noticed newish Aldi's when I moved to Pittsburgh and people's excitement about this store that I remembered as not being  so awesome as a kid.  \n\nThe stores are larger and a few more employees actually work there, but its nothing to write home about. The produce  was bruised and unremarkable... The oranges that I bought molded within a week and I could not find staples like rice, dry beans or plain pasta. There was however organic milk and a few other nice products. And just as one other reviewer mentioned there is a lot of processed sugar crap here. Fake juices, soda, cereal, snacks. It felt like the grocery store was missing its groceries a little. \n\nAs for me and my money I will continue to go to other BYOBs like Good Cents and Bottom Dollar."
2,"I suppose this place as aiight.\n\nMe and my friend shared a plate of the meat combo entree and the grape leaf appetizers. It was definitely enough to fill us. Ended up paying $17 per person not including tip.\n\nOverall I wasn't too impressed with the place. The decor was whatever. The service was really bad and ......Russian?? Who worked here who was from the Mediterranean really?\n\nI probably would not come back. It was just so moderate on every level. If this is the best Vegas has got, then everyone ought to raise their standards."
2,"After 6 visits I think it's safe for me to give my honest opinion. \n\nThings I like: \nThe studio space, it's cool and industrial yet warm and inviting. \n\nThe class descriptions and variety offered, although I've only tried a couple different ones, I really like the concept of the yoga fusions. \n\nIn the past they have had really great deals on their classes through twitter and facebook, not so much lately.\n\nThe owner is always there to greet you with a smile, she is super sweet and welcoming. \n\nThings I don't Like: \nThe monthly unlimited you have to agree to 3 month contract that would be automatically deducted form your checking account and these terms aren't made clear on their website. \nI have enough bills being drafted from my account I don't want to add to the list. \n\nThe Bathrooms (toilets, floors) still aren't clean and there is no adequate changing space like a bench or chair to put your things on. \nI personally don't want to put my belongings down on the bathroom floor. \n\nIt's too far away from me, obviously not their fault but a viable reason for why I cant make it a regular Yoga stop. \n\nThey don't have a menu of classes available to take with you.\n\nClosing Statement:\nLike Gabi's review stated, SuTRA has a lot of potential, I look forward to seeing the transformation and wish them the best of luck for the future."
4,Amazing knowledge of foods that are healthy for type preys!   They have coupons also!
1,"let me make this clear:  this review is for THIS Chipotle and this Chipotle ONLY!  i've never had what i consider a friendly experience here.  (mental note: the one on 59th and thunderbird is closer.  i need to go there next time)  the last time i went in, it was on the heels of a great experience at another location (if i have time it'll be right above this one).  first of all, there was  a pretty long line considering that it wasn't really busy.  i considered the possiblity that there could be ONE customer  up there that wasn't sure what they wanted or something along those lines, but as the line crept along i realized that it wasn't a customer, but indeed the staff behind the counter.  when i ordered my vegetarian burrito, the burrito maker didn't seem to know  what went in it.  come on guys, you have a VERY basic, very SIMPLE menu.  the veggie burrito gets by default: onion and pepper mix, BLACK BEANS (unlike the other burritos where you get a choice -- of course you CAN substitute the pinto beans, but if you don't specify you get the black).  he points to the pepper and onion mix and asks if that's what i want. \""yes\"".  then he put the rice in.  no beans until i reminded him.  i realize we all have our off days, but there was just a bunch of stuff off here.  no one was smiling or friendly and the burritos seemed a little smaller than what i'm used  to at a Chipotle.  If i'd never been to one before, i'd probably just suck it up and enjoy my delish food, but i KNOW this isn't the standard and was really disappointed.  from now on i MUST remember that there is another one in my vicinity and go there instead."
0,This nightmare of an embarrassment of a dinner .. Not only doesn't serve the eggs Benedict but when I ordered the lobster omelet.. It arrived 37 minutes later (empty restaurant people! ) with no lobster ! ! ! I can't even imagine the mess this place is when it gets busy.. If it even does ..This place sucks. Might as well go to McDonald's  or starve .. Stomach acid is way better.
4,"Alright fellow yelpers,\nWhen I first heard about this place it took me forever to finally try it out, and look at how my addiction has grown. Yes, it is a little bit on the pricey side, but if you go when they have their happy hours then my stomach is satisfied and my wallet isn't so empty. Now this place has quickly became my favorite spot for sushi, for a few reasons ... Their Johnny roll is my favorite, happy hours, and the atmosphere. So with that said, please do come here and try it out for  yourselves. There is plenty to choose from the AYCE menu and you can add to it for a few dollars more. So at least try this place out. (:"
1,"I recently went to this establishment for lunch.\nI have been here before but decided to give them another go since their remodel menu expansion.\nThe service was slow at best. They weren't very busy, may have been understaffed. I imagine they don't pay well as the wait staff didn't seem interested.\nI ordered their signature \""Vinny's burger burger\"" medium-well, with a side of french fries.\nThe burger came overcooked and dry.\nThe fries, also overcooked. They advertise fresh-cut fries, but my order had a very dark appearance and will small in length.\nI'm sure this place does great bottle/six-pack business due to their large selection.\nThey may want to reconsider items on their menu or better yet, give up food all together."
4,Love this place. Always something new. Changing all the time. Very user friendly. Also lots of fun shopping. Good food every where. Live intertainment. Even the security was helpfully.
3,"I love an airport that feels like a casino.  If they had free cocktails and waitresses in little skirts, I'd give 'em the full five stars.  There is good people watching here if you run outta quarters."
2,"The Flamingo is what it is:  one of the original strip hotels trying to keep up with the never ending crop of new, ultra-modern hotels.  The flamingo succeeds on some levels:  full amenities, clean rooms, recent redesign.  It mostly fails though.   Service is poor, casino floor is dingy, the rooms are not up to par with neighboring hotels, and dining/nigh life offerings are poor.  Margaritaville is a nice try, but it comes off as dated and cheesy.  \nFlamingo is centrally located though and the rooms are nice.  The value is high too (relatively cheap).  Not a bad choice and MUCH better than the Imperial Dungeon."
4,"Never having been to Wisconsin, I was pleasantly surprised to find this clean, spacious and well organized store. Virtually a one-stop shop for all your grocery needs with a number of \""bonus\"" points including a photo lab, US Postal Service, wine & spirits, bulk foods, Caribou Coffee counter, hot food & deli, plus a drive-thru pharmacy. They even had some Badger gear. If I wasn't in such a hurry to catch a plane i could have spent the whole afternoon there."
2,"Good but not great AYCE.  \n\nI really enjoyed the appetizers that came with the AYCE and the nigiri was flavorful and fresh.  But the rolls were smothered in sauces and the flavors didn't complement each other.\n\nWe had the scallop and bacon, beef and shrimp skewers - definitely yummy!  Sucks that you can only do one per customer\n\nSeafood Udon - good amount of seafood and flavor in this dish but it is a big portion and definitely fills you up with non-sushi...\n\nThe fried calamari was not too greasy and just the right amount of chew.\n\nPoke Salad - Very nice size portion and good chunks of tuna\n\nSalmon, yellowtail, mackarel, halibut, white tuna, and squid were all fresh tasting and flavorful.\n\nGood service but there was only one other occupied table while we were there.\n\nSo if you are going for AYCE with non-sushi eaters or if you stick to nigiri, this is a great place to come visit.  If you are looking for flavorful, creative and tasty rolls, I would go to one of the other many better AYCE places in town."
1,"Not sure why management is dressed in casual shirts and jeans.  It really brought down the whole feel for the restaurant, but I digress.\n\nThe food!\n\nOur server left us pretty early on and one of the managers helped us out.  Except he was terrible at explaining everything, so we just ended up nodding and not even knowing what we ordered (probably the omakase).  \n\nThe presentation barely fit on the table, and while the sashimi was good, we agreed that the second plate of rolls and other sushis were probably better.  Nothing is too memorable other than being quite full.  \n\nI recognize that this place is expensive (every other review talks about how pricey it is), but this is coming from someone who didn't even pay for my meal (shout out to my wonderful friends!), it probably isn't worth how little or much you pay here, I wouldn't come back.\n\nAlso, dangit, I forgot to try the wings.  So if you're stuck at Blue Ribbon right now, reading reviews for what to get, that's what you're supposed to get.  I remembered reading about it but forgot, then someone asked us if we got it when we told him where we had eaten.  Oh well."
1,"Having relocated from NYC, maybe my standards are just too high for Vegas. I'm used to definitive answers, prompt service, and great value (contrary to popular belief, quality salon services are quite affordable in NYC if you know where to look due to the hyper competitive environment) and I just did not get that here.\n\nI made an appointment earlier this week to get my hair done today with Ellice after finding the salon on Groupon and reviewing the Yelp reviews on here. I noted I found them via Groupon and spoke with her on the phone about what I was looking to get done. She asked if I had purchased the Groupon yet and said \""Oh, good!\"" when I told her I hadn't, then insisted I not purchase the Groupon, noting she would honor the price (to save herself the fees, of course--typically Groupon charges businesses 50% of the voucher price!). I obliged as I understand what it is like to own a business and have friends that own small businesses. She DID mention there may be a slight up charge if I have a lot of hair or very long hair but was very vague with the exact costs.\n\nWhen I got to the salon today, I sat down and she says the up charge would be either $20 or $40 yet could not give me a definitive answer as to which one despite a) looking at my hair in detail / feeling it and brushing it so she obviously knows the thickness and length and b) my asking repeatedly. First red flag there--an experienced stylist SHOULD be able to eyeball approximately how much color is needed if they see your hair in person. 1 tube extra or 2 tubes extra is a wide range and you should be able to narrow it down to approx. 1 tube or approx. 1.5-1.75 (aka 2 tubes). Also, it just seemed shady to me to begin with considering that in my 10+ years of getting my hair colored and highlighted at various salons in NYC, using Groupon deals the majority of the time, I have never once had to deal with an up charge and my hair was longer/thicker before I moved here (I had it layered to reduce the thickness and cut shorter a few months back).\n\nI mentioned that if it was $40 extra, it would not be worth it for me to take a risk on their services since it is my first time. Yes, I don't mind paying for quality but how do I know its quality if I've never tried it and everyone's hair is different? While she/they may be great at caucasian hair, they could totally butcher Asian hair (this has happened to me countless times before).\n\nSince I am taking a risk and looking for a new go-to salon now that I've relocated here, I noted I am willing to pay the extra $20 but not $40 as that would make the total more than what I would pay in NYC for a cut & color at my trusted stylists AND more than all the other local salons' REGULAR prices (I got quotes from 2 others with just as great/better reviews on Yelp) so in essence, I would not be getting any discount. Also, considering that I did not buy the Groupon per their request, they would be getting an extra $34.50 from me than they typically do from Groupon customers since they're not paying Groupon the 50% fee so if they were good business people and could do math, they would realize that they've more than recouped the \""extra costs.\"" My mother has owned a salon before so I know how much professional hair color costs and it sure as hell is nowhere near the $20 per tube they quoted, even if they use high end products.\n\nAll in all, this business is just run very poorly and perhaps Ellice is a good stylist but management is not welcoming to new clients apparently. There are plenty of salons who will appreciate your business and are looking to attract new clients in Vegas so I would go elsewhere. Its one thing if you're marketing yourself as a high end salon and charging high end prices but this is a neighborhood salon, not the most convenient location, not the most high end, and offering a so-called \""deal\"" on Groupon to attract new clients yet adding extra charges when you show up so that the \""deal\"" is no longer a \""deal\""...just reminded me of my awful car buying experience and all the extra fees once they get you through the door! \n\nAt the end of everything, I did not get my hair done with them as it appears to be a business/salon that wants to nickel & dime their customers more than they want new clients. They were completely unwilling to budge on capping the up charge even when I stated I would be fine with $20 (about 29% of the $69 groupon) if they could just cap it at that.\n\n2 stars instead of 1 for the fact that Ellice was friendly throughout the whole discussion/ordeal despite her manager / the owner's poor business development and customer service skills.\n\nLastly, as a seasoned Yelper--I would caution you all to be wary of businesses with many reviews from individuals with a) less than 10 reviews and b) no photo(s) of themselves as oftentimes, friends & family write biased reviews."
2,"Service: 3S\nRooms: 4S\n\nWe've stayed here a few times and this is the first time that I've had a problem.  We checked into the room and settled in. Hung up our clothes, put our belongings where they belong. Mixed ourselves a drink. No problem so far.\n\nI decided the jump into the pool for a swim, wait a minute I meant sit on the couch. Yes, the couch was wet as if it was a swimming pool.  I immediately call the front desk and they apologized and said that they just finished cleaning the room and the couch was dry and they didn't fully dry it yet.  The asked if I wanted to be moved to a different room.  Excuse me? If you knew this, then maybe you should've gave us another room to begin with?  \n\nI informed them that we are all already settled in and I suggest that they just bring two couch cushions  from another room and simply swap it.  They said they couldn't do that.  They will send room service with towels to dry the couch.  15 mins later, room service came with towels and some crazy loud fan to dry to couch.  I expressed my disappointment.  The cleaning guy said he will try to get two couch cushions and swap it for us, sounds like an idea that I heard somewhere before.\n\nI tipped the guy for swapping my couch cushions.  I am utterly disappointed in Encore staff for failing so many ways.  I expect this from Imperial Palace or even Harrahs, not Encore. Shame on you. Probably the last time I stay at Encore, back to Cosmo."
2,"I'm not sure if this is the most legitimate way to judge a restaurant, but I was hungover and after eating the food at Blueberry Hill, I still felt like I wasn't satisfied. Granted, I didn't try their pancakes, but the food tasted mediocre and was sparse. \n\nI had the corn beef hash with eggs and hash browns. The corn beef was good and was the standard that you could get at any breakfast place. The hash browns were a little stale and the eggs were eggs. \n\nYay for ketchup."
4,"Amazing!!! This place is a must.  Fantastic BBQ. Super friendly and attentive staff and don't even get me started on the sides... Bacon potato salad, corn bread and banana pudding.  This place is awesome!!!"
3,Not bad at all.... And im usually picky when it comes to my Ramen. I would definetly come back to this place
3,Our first time here and our server Matthew was very helpful with suggestions. Omelets were excellent and the potato chips were awesome.
4,"I am pleased with the service and quality of this place.\n\nFirst of all, it is easy to locate-- especially if you are visiting downtown Phoenix and using the light rail for the first time (it's right across the Central & Roosevelt station).\n\nThe atmosphere is perfect for:\n- studying/ reading/ internet browsing\n- meeting with a friend for some coffee/tea/snack\n\nThey have an outside patio as well. Their drink selection is great. They have coffees, smoothies, teas, sandwiches, and other pastries. Prices were reasonable. The staff is definitely friendly and they are very efficient in how they operate. \n\nDefinitely would go there again if I am in the Phoenix area. Loved it."
4,"Always a great spot to grab lunch, and contrary to what I've heard, you don't have to be LDS to eat there. J/K.  Great lunch specials!"
4,"Went to Ah-So last night for the first time. Took advice from other reviewers and drove right past the location on Happy Valley and proceeded to this one. What a wonderful experience it was! Good service, the owner and his wife welcomed us personally... and the food was great. I had the Filet, Shrimp and Chicken Teppanyaki combo; my dining partner had the lobster, scallop and shrimp combo. The young grill master (Terry) was funny and quite adept with the tools of the trade. The filet was my favorite - it was like buttah. Just melted in your mouth. The scallops were cooked perfectly. It was a mountain of food and now we have dinner for tonight. Just one thing could have been better - we waited for our second hot sake order. But Terry saved the day and ran over to the bar himself and filled the order. Over and Above... We are looking forward to returning to this little jewel!"
0,"Don't stay here. I'll sum it up like this: They tried to force me to take a double queen instead of the king I paid for, I insisted and got the king room. In the room it had dirty towels( had stains ), then there was mold on the tile in the bathroom along with freshly spattered BLOOD, the coffee maker  set up was on a cubby shelf with no outlet so I made coffee on the floor, I called before making the reservation and asked if they were still renovating- they said no, two days later when I arrived the entire place was being worked on and sharing elevators with the workers and tools not appealing, I can go on... Oh and the drunk hooker with a dog in her purse and spilling out 100 dollar bills walking by added to the experience!"
0,"Guy Fieri, why do you do this to me!! I love your shows so much and I had such high expectations for your restaurant, but you let me down! \n\nI had to get the mac n cheese burger, because if anyone should know how to put together a crazy delicious burger combination, it's Guy. However, the flavors were seriously lacking- the mac n cheese tasted like watered down easy mac! The buffalo fries were equally disappointing- huge fried potato slices with buffalo and blue cheese dipping sauces on the side- the sauces were overpowering and the fries themselves too dry. I did taste my friend's tacos and I think they must be the winner on the menu, but again nothing to write home about if you've ever had a good taco in Southern California. I won't be returning. :("
0,"Not the worst, but definitely could have been better.  I don't like having an empty glass while I'm at a restaurant, you would figure on a slow Monday night service would be a bit better.  We walked in and no greeter was there, no line of people either.  When asking for sauce it shouldn't arrive after your food has gotten cold.  Dirty silverware is always a turn off.  Not that we were planning on getting dessert it wasn't even offered before our waiter brought the check.  Actually it was never offered.  Most likely our last visit here, now I remember why we quit coming here, usually get bad service at Applebees."
2,"This review is just from a Take-out perspective. I had a free voucher from LV Local and used it trying OM. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and flavor of the food. We order two combo-entree's for $8.99 each and I ordered the aloo cauliflower, chicken curry, chili chicken, and naan. The naan was naan bad (not bad). Would have given them a 4-star but not all the entrees were available for the combo meal and the portions were small. I guess I'm spoiled from Panda express. Anyways I will definitely return because it's close by and inexpensive for Indian food. May give an update on review. Hope this helps."
0,Went there for memorial day weekend the racist bastard at the door did want to let me in because of my foreign Belizean ID from the Belizean Embassy in Los Angeles. He was very rude to me and my party yelled at us and told us to leave the building or he would call the cops. It was a very stressful ordeal now Rehab dont want to refund us our money.I left emails and called and still no response. They need to learn to respect customers. Iam 28 years old and was being treated like a minor trying to use a fake ID.... I will never give up..
1,"The food just isn't very good. The service is not very good either. However, they find a way to keep the place packed. I just have no motivation to go back and eat there."
3,"Being someone who is not a fan of red meat, I don't go to steak restaurants very often.  But my best friend wanted to eat here and she was buying so... kind of a no brainer.  Our waiter, Damien, was very helpful.  I asked him for advice on different steaks, he asked how I like mine cooked, I told him well done (steak lovers, don't criticize, I prefer my meat NOT mooing!).  He recommended the New York strip so that's what I got.  It was very tasty and the baked potato I had with it was fabulous.  My friend however, ordered filet mignon, which was so rare it pretty much should've still had hooves and a bell around its neck, but she likes it that way apparently.  Hers, however, was a very bad cut of meat - it had this massive section of fat in it.  Even the waiter was appalled.  He had the manager come over to check it out and the manager gave us free dessert and took some money off the price of my friend's filet.  We had the brownie sundae for dessert and it was delicious!  I wish I could've eaten more of it!  Overall, my meal was really good.  I wish my friend had gotten a better filet but then there wouldn't have been free dessert and I am certainly not going to complain about free dessert.  Despite not being a huge fan of steak I would definitely go back to the Keg."
3,"Nice, clean, very friendly staff help me find the perfect coffee travel mug for my husband and gave me tips on some other stuff I got \nNice brands love the retail price \nIm usually a Ross shopper but Marshall as for now had Better prices on brand names items \ndefinitely wil go back !!!"
4,"We always have a great time here. Sercivce, food and all. Usually make a fiew friends too."
4,They got this down. The chef is the best. He definitely knows how to please peoples pallets. amazing food and great staff. I recommend everyone to come and dine here.
3,"I enjoyed the Bellagio. Best of all was its location on the Vegas strip.  The hotel is quite large with great rooms that have great views.  As a smoker, the hotel that offers smoking rooms that are beautiful is a definite plus.\n\nIMO, the pool area is the best part of this hotel.  It's open from 9a to 4p and offer full waiter service to get your drink on.  Great towels and beautiful pool area makes it enjoyable for both families and adults."
1,"the biggest strip club in the world?!?!?!  im there!!!  \n\nwalked in around 10 ish...still early for vegas time but we just couldn't wait to have boobies rubbed all over us especially my homeboy eugine y. that wrote the review below mine.  haha!!!  what up nucka...holla at cha boy!  \n\n$30 bux to get in as usual in vegas.  walked in and it was extremely packed full of perverts.  it was pretty much standing room unless we got bottle service.  so we ended up getting a bottle skyy for $350...ouch!  where we sat seemed like a prime spot, in the middle of the club towards the back, felt like a vip for the moment.  \n\nsome of these girls will try and rip u off!  its $20 for a lap dance, some were trying to say its more!  $200 for 30 min. vip dance in the back with a 2 drink minimum for both you and the stripper.  you do have the option to do $100 for 15 mins but they won't tell you that.  \n\nthey said there was a few hundreds girls that night working but it felt way less than that.  we started to notice a pattern, wtf is up with all the ugly bishes coming up to us???  is it because we look like a group of perverted asians???  probably!  haha!  we did have my boy who was white sitting with us so we did get some action come our way but it was all asian chicks!  i have nothing against asian chicks but im asian so i wanted to see something different.  its like having chinese food every night at home and when you go out to dinner, you want some tacos once in awhile...ya heard!  \n\nthen you hear from the dj...sapphires welcomes nba champion robert horry in the house.  then it clicked, all the hot bishes are probably with his entourage!  overall, i would have rather spent the night at a bar somewhere on the strip watching hot chicks walk by in their club outfits!!!  ain't that right eugine y.?!?!?!"
1,I have loved Phil's Grill for years but the last few times have been so so. The service is very slow when you sit on the patio.  I also recommend staying away from the tacos.
4,"Update! I found out that you can order the Veggie Beer bread the \""old\"" way and they will make it for you how they used to. Hooray!"
1,"This is the 3rd time at Toast and I can definitely say I won't be going back. \n\nHere is the lowdown on my thoughts:\n\nService - 2 stars\nBloody Mary - 1 star (mix is awful)\nChicken wrap- 4stars.... Lots of chicken in that wrap, had service been better to have sauces - it would have been much better \n\nOthers breakfast were rated around 2-3 stars... We were w a group of 6\n\nWouldn't go back, so many other great places"
2,"I needed some new tires for my Harley, so i decided to check out the dealership first. I was quoted a price of $800 for two new motorcycle tires, installed. Wow! I'm sorry but that is ridiculous! I called another small shop after hearing the $800 quote and low and behold I found a shop to do the tires for $400. That is a little more like it. I like the staff here, they are always great, I just am amazed at the prices on EVERYTHING! They are super expensive, from an HD coffee mug to tires, you are going to pay out the ass for stuff here. Like I said before, the staff is great. They are knowledgeable and always there when you need them. When you do end up having services done here they wash and detail your bike before they give it back to you. Nice courtesy but you definitely pay for it. Lower the prices a bit guys and I would use you for a lot more!!"
3,"This is definitely one of the better resort pools if you're trying to find somewhere to cool off with your kids. We came here recently for the Yelp pool party and have since returned twice to relax and cool down. Our kids have had a blast each time! They especially loved the lazy river and the waterfalls. They also liked the zero entry pool (where it slopes down from the deck level to the bottom, like a beach). My youngest enjoyed the fact that she could just walk into the water and be at a comfortable depth. The fact that this pool seems to attract the kid crowd is nice for people that don't want a meat market atmosphere, too. There were a couple of hoochies and meat-heads walking around, but they really looked out-of-place. \""Go back to your Scottsdale pools and let us swim with our kids!\"" I agree with some of the other reviewers that they could pick up the trash more frequently, especially on the lazy river. There were cups and cans on either side along the entire length of the river. If they just put some short trash cans every few hundred feet then people would probably utilize them to throw their garbage in. There seems to be enough employees wandering around that they could keep the place tidy. But that's a small complaint. As for the food, we ate at Slim Picken's bar right next to the pool. The menu items didn't seem outrageously priced, and they had drink specials that seemed to be a pretty good deal. We ordered the nachos, which were decent. For $7 there were a fair amount of chips, cheese, onions, olives and jalapenos. We also ordered the pizza , which was way overpriced. It was $8, tiny and tasted like a cheap Tombstone pizza. We barely ordered in time, too, as they shut down the bar kitchen at 6:00 pm. It seems a little strange, because the pool is open until 8:00 pm on the weekdays. Some people might want to stay at the pool until it closes and eat dinner pool-side. But, again, these are minor complaints. Overall, it's a fun resort pool and your kids will be absolutely worn out by the end of the day."
0,"Did not enjoy my meal at all. Ordered the eggplant appetizer. First cut into it and oil flooded my plate. Could not get myself to eat it. The main courses were completely forgettable. The service was pretty bad too, had to wait forever until someone came and took my order for the second glass of wine. First time here, and probably the last time. Don't care too much about the bad service, but really bad  food, that is not acceptable."
1,"BOOKING / CHECK IN: booked online (bed breakfast package, king bed, no smoke). get there at 12midnight, huge line to check in. customer service is rude! they said a reservation is only a request and then tried to shove us in a smoking room, then called and acted as though she did us a favor by putting us in a non smoke room (by the elevator). \n\nnever gave us our breakfast coupon or opened up our room so it would be charged, hubby had to go back down to correct her mistake.\n\nCASINO: played in casino (cocktail waitress was too good to bring us a beer)? have no idea what her problem was.\n\nCHECK OUT: this lady threw the bill at me, i asked because it was kind of confusing the way they list all charges, she got a pen, circled stuff and was very rude, embarassed me completely. \n\nNo one every welcomed us or thanked us for staying there.\n\nSPA: I had booked 2 massages, never got them, they were unable to do any day / time we wanted and could only tell us what they could do, and couldnt accomodate what we wanted. \n\nTHE ROOM: tiny drops of blood on the white bead spred? room appeared to be clean other than that, cheap shower, head was falling out of wall & sink was cracked.\n\nFor $100 (approx.) per night, I would of expected better!\n\nGOOD POINTS:\n\nVirginia is a bartender there - she is funny! and provides great conversation! :)\n\nValet - they are all very polite!"
1,"stayed here for the weekend and it was surprisingly a little better than i expected. the rooms were fairly clean but you can tell everything was dated. the carpets definitely need to be replaced, they had all kinds of cigarette burns in them. the outlet in our bathroom didn't  work so we couldn't use any hairstyling tools. they have a vanity but it has no light and no outlets near it? the beds were super comfy though! i have to say the best beds i've ever had in a hotel. we had a cute little balcony that surprisingly opened! we ate at the hooters restaurant and that has got to be the WORST service i've had. my friends and i literally got the WORST table in the place. i'm not trying to say it in a way to offend anybody but the table we got looked like it was meant for someone handicapped because it was so low, it was in the corner and all the tables around us were high tops. wtf is that? the food didn't  even come in order, the entrees got there before the apps. leave it up to hooters to be the ONLY place in vegas to treat their guests like crap because the majority were girls. the food wasn't very good either, we ended up switching one of our orders of wings for something else. our waitress was very rude too she was giving us attitude and made it seem like she didn't  want to be serving us. no smiles, and I'm sure i saw her roll her eyes. we got charged a $60 resort fee.... ha! resort? i don't understand why they would charge so much! maybe if they updated the place and got more amenities i wouldn't mind. one cool thing is the pool is open 24/7."
0,Complete scam!! Got discount food tix from tix4tonight!\nI have done this before with good 25% off whole check.\nThis time we were required to show our coupon to hostess and server before being seated or served.\nConfident we were given an over priced menu!!!!!! Able to compare online menu; as service so slow full 8$ more on our menu!!!!! \nBeware!! Complain!!
2,"Three years ago, I would have given this place 5 stars. Today, three stars is a bit of stretch. In short.. great concept, poor execution.\n\nCreate your own cupcakes? Sounds great! Kids adore this place. They have several different flavors, toppings, fillings, and they can even sculpt Elmo. \n\nThe issue with the cupcakes is the texture. It's hard to eat them without a utensil. They crumble when you bite into them. The cupcakes have great flavor. They just happen to be too moist.\n\nIf you have a kiddo with you, stop by. If not, head to Gigi's,  the Cupcakery or even Smith's."
2,"It's really more like 3.5 stars.  Better than 'OK' but not like I'm a total Fan... I mean... it's a really good breakfast but they don't serve bloody marys... so.... ya know.\n\nService:\nGot there a little before 8am... there were a few people in line but we were seated quickly... and the busser got us our coffees and waters really quick... and then we waited for like 15 minutes.  Our waitress was slammed and she was 1 of only 2 working at the moment.\nShe was really nice and efficient.\nOur food was delivered quickly... and hot.\n\nFood:\nTaste.... right on!  I ordered the Veggie Benny... and it came with lots of avocado slices which I love!  The side of potatoes were 'ok'...nothing special... they need seasoning or something but I don't really need the extra starch... so I left them.\n\nThe hubby had the croissant breakfast sandwich and that looked good... I didn't get a taste because I was too excited about the yummy avocados on my dish.\n\nThe FIL got the oatmeal overload.... WOW!  It came with fresh berries, cream, raisins, brown sugar and almond slivers on the side... and a huge bowl of oatmeal.  Looked Great and he was happy with it so thumbs up.\n\nWill I be back?  For Sure.  :)"
1,This outlet lies way south of the strip and is easily accessible by bus if you don't have car.\nAs for the mall its in decay like many places in Vegas. I got a dimly lit old feel when I walked in.\nPlenty of shops to go around but the prices aren't any better from the north branch outlet of this outlet.\nFood court is just a ragtag of chain fast food food joints. Nothing special to try here.\nIf you are looking for outlet prices I would recommend driving all the way down to Primm Valley outlets.
2,"We ended up here on a Friday night close to 10pm, partly because there aren't many restaurants in the Valley open this late and partly, because we tried it before and found it \""okay\"".  This time, I wanted to order the campong; but the waitress made it clear, in both word and facial expression, that it would take a long time to make and it was obvious she didn't want me ordering it for that reason.  That was fine.  I had instead a dish, which basically took most of what is presented as cold appetizers in multiple dishes brought to the table, except mixed together, served very hot on a bed of rice and included an egg and a little meat.  While I do enjoy the cold appetizer dishes, I have to admit, they taste better very hot.  My partner had a soup, which could be best described as pot stickers in broth.  The amount of food was copious and we were quite happy with what we got  (which was not the case the first time we came here).  The fact that neither of us are Koreaphiles and know Korean food doesn't exactly help in choosing items.  For one thing, almost every dish on the \""entree\"" page is soup.  While I readily admit that Vietnamese Pho, for example, could easily fill you up, because everything and anything is thrown into the soup, I come from a background where soup is something served as an accompaniment to a meal, not a meal in itself.  So, mentally, a soup for dinner wouldn't cut it with me.  The 'non-soup' entrees are limited and are on the menu's back page; so don't despair if you can't seem to find items that aren't soup!\n\nThe restaurant is small and intimate.  There are a few booths made to look like stereotypical Korean \""huts\"".  I feel like I'm in a cage sitting in one of them; my partner likes the privacy and cozy feeling they provide.  A TV plays in the background, which might be fine, if you understand Korean.  However, the scenes from a report about some hospital and skin diseases (along with a blurred image of a man doing his business at a urinal) is not really something I want to be seeing while I eat.\n\nThere have been complaints on Yelp, that they're not very attentive when it comes to filling the appetizer dishes.  I can only say, that these appetizers arrived after we were sitting a very long time and (coincidentally?) very close before the main meals came out.  Whether this is done on purpose to limit how much of the appetizers you'll eat before your dinner shows up so they don't have to refill it, I don't know.  But the coincidence seems pretty strange; especially considering other complaints about this very topic.\n\nTo sum up, while I would enjoy a bi-yearly trip here (six months ... two years ... you choose the meaning!), Korean food simply isn't something that wows me enough to make the effort to make a special trip out here ... especially from the west valley, some 45 minutes away.  The food is hearty; can be very spicy (though I didn't think overly so ... maybe I'm just very used to spicy food); and, let's face it, \""basic\"".  I've yet to have ANY Korean food that I'd describe as \""finessed\"" or \""subtly spiced\"".  That may just be me.  Sushi will always get top billing with me (but not other Japanese food!); followed by Vietnamese and then Szechuan.  Korean food just seems to be something that I find \""collides violently\"" with my taste buds and assaults the senses.  As proletarian as my taste in food can be, I just don't find enough variety in taste to make the cuisine something I can get excited over.  Add to that a small restaurant, which is very hot in summer (when we last went), crowded, not cheap and has slow service and my enthusiasm drops even more.\n\nI don't dispute fans, who've written that this is the next best place to Inchon or Seoul in the Valley.  Like I said, I'm no aficionado of this cuisine, so I wouldn't know.  I can only say, my taste buds told me, that this food and the service in this restaurant is more \""Pyongyang\"" than it is anything down south.\n\nAcceptable; but no \""wow\"""
1,"2.5 stars\n\nI have some really fond memories of Fitzgerald's. I visited this location as a broke college student and though it is off the strip, the beds aren't the comfiest, it reeks of cigarette smoke and lacks all the bells and whistles of the modern Vegas hotels we have all become accustomed to, Fitzgerald's has a few things going for it: \n\n1. Cheap drinks at the bar.  SUPER cheap!\n\n2. Cheap slots and card games. You can play the penny slots and $5 blackjack tables to you heart's content\n\n3. The staff here are absolutely amazing.  They are friendly, accomodating and will bend over backward for you. \n\nThis is a great low cost option for those traveling to Vegas on a budget.  That being said, \""The Fitz\""could really use a facelift."
1,"Been there twice.  Once because of a Groupon.  Service was pretty good except the server cheated us out of some change at the end (a common occurrence we are noticing in the Las Vegas area).  The food tasted good and the setting is cozy, yet kinda cool.  Like an upscale sports bar with better food and not TVs.\nWe wanted to avoid the NYE strip traffic so we went to Sedona with a couple friends this past NYE and it pretty much sucked.  We had reservations and despite arriving on time, had to wait about 25 min. to get to seated. In the meantime we sat at a bar table and it took a while for us to get our drinks.  The bar server told us the beers 2 of us wanted were not available, then the check came out with the unavailable beers listed on it..  I received the wrong drink altogether.  Then we were seated so we asked to transfer the bill as we hadn't ordered food yet.  Our server said it wouldn't be a problem but the bar server i guess wanted her own tip or something cuz she came back saying she \""needed to close out\"" our bill separately.  Yet once we paid she just left the book there with her tip in it.  (Oh yeah, this was after it took her like another 20 min to bring back the change in the first place.)\nMeanwhile we were presented with additional \""pre fixe\"" menus, then a few minutes later told that they were out of them.  In addition the server told us a few other items on the reg menu they were out of.  Seems very unprepared and unprofessional for an established restaurant serving people on NYE.\nThe rest of the service was fine and all the food tasted very good but not sure if we can get past the above issues.. Feel free to check it out for yourself.  If you have low expectations hopefully you won't be disappointed."
2,"This place is new to the scene. I did enjoy it. There is a faux tree inside the restaurant which is sort of cool. The layout is kind of tight which is slightly uncomfortable. I went in on a Monday with some girlfriends for their all you can eat crab legs. Served at 6 pm until they run out. The crab legs were really good, some of the best tasting I've had outside of the beach. The service could have been a little better, but I blame it on the place still being new. I wasn't a big fan of the drink menu, I got a muddled drink with blueberries which lacked taste. I had it sent back and requested more syrup but it came back the same way. I would definitely return, but probably just for the all you can eat crab. It's not really my scene."
4,"This is the Pizza place i have searched for all my life, The new york style pizza just melts in your mouth. The perfect crust has been created at enzo's.\nyou must go here period.."
0,"WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!  DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL.  My husband and I were in town to vend at a music festival.  After reviewing this hotel on YELP, we decided to stay here and stayed in Room 104.  We were assaulted by BEDBUGS in the middle of the night.  We immediately alerted staff, who saw the actual bugs as my husband and I took pictures.  They offered me another room in the same hotel.  Sorry, not acceptable.  The manager on the phone was very rude and non-empathetic to our plight.  Finally, after I hung up on him, in tears, the manager called the front desk and had them find us other accommodations.  It took us over an hour to find the new hotel. They did not charge us for the room that night, but have yet to refund the $25 fee they collect for incidentals. We got NO SLEEP that night bc by the time we found the other hotel, it was time for us to leave to work at festival for which we were in town.  BEDBUG bites (about 15 of them) were severe enough to send me to the E.R.  Management would not speak to me for over a week after incident, only to reveal that they were unwilling to do anything to rectify my medical expense and my loss of income due to missing part of the festival at which I was working.  I had to specially treat all of our clothing, not to mention purchase new clothing to wear bc everything in the hotel room had to be put in garbage bag for heat treatment.  I reported to Health Department.  They claim they saw no signs of bedbugs and that the room was quarantined and the mattress against the wall.  EMPLOYEES SAW THE BEDBUGS.  I believe there was a cover up.   Manager told me I was welcome to sue them.  I AM!!!"
2,"67 reviews. Holy frack.  I've watched a few soccer matches at the downtown San Diego Yard House, never been impressed.  Haven't eaten dinner there in half a decade.  I ate here on friday night with a mixed tables of locals and visitors- everyone was pretty satisfied with their meal and the dinner was impeccable.  On the other hand, the douche factor is through the roof: tons of ed hardy and ladies rocking the high heels/shorts look.  I think they actually charge a cover on friday and saturday night?  I know they have a similar scene at the San Diego Yard House, but I literally can not fathom why people would come here on a friday or saturday night."
3,"I ordered the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash for brunch. It was very different. The sweet potato was not soft enough but the spicy chicken was tender and the sauce was good, which made it taste better and balanced it. I also tried the Mesa burger which I enjoyed very much and the fries were seasoned well."
4,"As a new business owner I was a couple years behind on filing my business taxes.  Lizeth at iQ Taxx was very courteous to me with all my questions, and there were plenty.  Also keeping me informed on the whole process from beginning to end.  I am very happy to do business with iQ Taxx as they have helped me with mine.  Support Small Business :)"
2,"Pretty good food, great service. The presentation of the food might be better than the flavor... Lots of selection, fun place to try..."
1,"Since Vegas has a huge Hawaiian population, there are a lot of Hawaiian restaurants out here.  I've eaten a lot of Hawaiian food out here..but I didnt really like the food too much @ this particular restaurant. I didnt go to this location, I went to the one off of Maryland Pkway, near UNLV."
0,"I'm very suspicious about this place. The first time I went there, the dentist was so heavy handed and did not go over a lot of things with me as far as my dental condition. I had to probe and ask questions. He also seem to be in such a hurry to get out of there.\n\nThe 2nd time I went, I was shocked to see different people, different staff and different doctor. I was assured by the 2nd dentist, hygienist, and front desk receptionist that everyone will be there for my 6months cleaning and check-up.\n\nToday I arrived and found different staff. New dentist, new hygienist, etc. when I made a comment about me noticing different staff, the hygienist had the nerve to tell me 'well, why did you come back if you feel uncomfortable'. \n\nThis place is a joke! I wouldn't be surprised if they would have a totally different staff 6 months from now."
3,good pho. good ice coffee. lousy service. try ox tail pho. as good as italian ossobuco or better
2,We went her for our anniversary dinner. \n\nHostess and waiter were both wonderful.\n\nBread and olive oil for dipping were below average.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers. Beef carpaccio and fried calamari. Both average.\n\nMy husband had the ribeye and I had the filet mignon. He ordered his medium rare and I ordered medium well. Thy both came out medium. I sent mine back and it still came back bloody.
3,"When in Vegas, you think you'd find everything on the Strip, but Chinatown has a few gems just a few miles away. My friend took me here for lunch and it was a great place for some tasty food and for a mild hangover. \n\nWe ordered the duck fried rice and pad thai. The duck fried rice was delicious! Fried just enough, slightly sweet, and plenty of duck. I really, really enjoyed this dish. The pad thai was also good, not too special but just a staple when you go to a Thai restaurant.\n \nIt was pretty poppin on a Saturday so get ready for a bit of a wait but so worth it! Definitely try to get away from the Strip to try this place!"
0,"I am from New Mexico and I really miss the food so I was really happy to see a sign that said \""New Mexico Cuisine\"". This is false advertisement. Just cause you use Hatch chile does not make it New Mexico cuisine. And lets be serious, how can you charge $14.00 for beans and rice and for salsa that is to hot to eat. I have more, they dont have a kids menu so you have to buy sides that are over priced.. My niece ordered a $6.00 tostada that literally had 5 beans and a mountain of lettuce. I will stick with Filabertos.... they are cheaper and give bigger portions."
3,"When we get into the city late and don't have time or want to go to the clubs, we love coming here and hanging out for drinks.  It's a great atmosphere and the waitresses are always nice.  Sometimes there is a wait for a table but never too long.  The bartender pours very strong drinks every time I've been here.  We always enjoy Parasol Up for the people watching too."
3,-Consistant \n\n-Friendly staff.\n\n-Quickly helped customers in line.\n\n-Clean store.\n\n-Plenty of places to sit.
1,"I came here on my first visit to Edinburgh 3 years ago, and have deterred any of my visiting friends to do so since. It's a gory tour of Edinburgh's gory past, with a lot of dressed up people waiting around the corner to go boo. It definitely worked for the younger members of our tour group but it was very tackily done and the decorations and layouts of the places were not even convincing. And this is all for an expensive entry as well! My advice to those visiting Edinburgh is that you are in a very historic City with plenty of open air tours offered to real (quite scary) locations so why pay to see a replica of something you can walk to and see down the street ? (unless fake blood is your thing). I suppose it keeps the kids entertained?"
1,"The location is beautiful and interior has a unique touch so it has a lot of promise to be a great daytime business lunch or a cozy dinner date. \n\nWe were just at the Premium Outlets next door and Yelperazzi needs some drinks. \n\nThere were three different waiters coming to our table at first and that's a lot of milling about when they don't coordinate with each other. One already talked to us about drinks, another took our order, another wanted to give us menus and take our order again. The ordering waiter was pushing hard for us to get appetizers when we were going to just try a drink and sit here deciding our next venue. We were just left alone after given drinks and complimentary chips until we were brought a check. \n\nI got the Mundo Martini - Elnino said mine tasted like mountain dew blue. I've never had that, but the blue curacao and pineapple definitely come through and it's a sweet drink. I liked mine, but it wasn't the most palette tantalizing drink out there.\n\nThe Sassy Senority Margarita went to our sassy gal Lily. It has prickly pear in it and the juice was going bad which made the \""feet\"" taste. We suggest they taste check their juices periodically. \n\nElninos drink, the Paloma had grapefruit in it, but I barely tasted it since it seems they didn't put juice- just a fruit slice. It was strong alcohol if you drink from one part of the drink and then water on the other. Mixed up well since the flavors weren't together and then it was watered down vodka with a grapefruit in it. \n\nEl Andys probably was the most \""complex\"" in fragrance, but still was more sweet than anything. Still, the Spanish Kiss wasn't even a peck on the cheek. \n\nAll our drinks were $8-$11 which is a theft for drinks that didn't impress.(Sorry and thanks El Andy). Shoulda went to Herbs&Rye for a cocktail! \n\n So this isn't our spot for drinks it seems but I'll give them another try for Happy Hour appetizers and also I have a GC for dinner so I'll save the next review for the most important items- the food. For now, I think for the weirdly enthusiastic, pushy service turned cold to the subpar drinks the 2 I think is fair."
0,"Was in here today to purchase 3 things. I had a coupon for 1.00 off of Purex Cystals and I had used one the other day with no problem. I got to the cashier and the coupon would not scan, so she proceeds to read the whole thing word for word then tells me I got the wrong size. There is no size on the coupon, like I said I used the same one a few days ago.  She calls over her manager who tells me if the computer does not recognize it they do not take it. I said \""Seriously\"" and her manager turns around to me and says \""Yeah Seriously\"" ..No I am sorry . nothing . She did override and took the dollar off and when I said Thank You she just walked away. It's not about the dollar it's about the customer service and how rude this manager was ."
1,"I really want to like this place. a) i enjoy supporting downtown establishments b) i love doughnuts c) both a & b. Unfortunately, I have had these doughnuts three times now and each time, the doughnuts are extremely oily. So much so that you can't taste the actual doughnut flavors. and the flavors they have are so interesting and delicious sounding. I am so sad that they are so oily. On the plus side, i got an iced latte in salted caramel that was very tasty. I probably won't ever have their doughnuts again though. Sorry...but for the money they charge per doughnut, i expect them to be as delicious as voodoo doughnuts in Portland."
3,Huge place with tons of great shopping including most of the same chain stores you see in the US. There is also a Starbucks here and an extensive food court. It's easy to get lost in here but it's a fun place to pass the time.
0,"After seven months of e-mails and proof of a rip-off, management decided to do nothing. While in Vegas last September, three of us decided to park at the hotel's bar from 10:00 to 1:00 AM. The next day, my business partner had indicated that he had cover the bar bill for $200.00, he left at 12:00 midnight. In looking in my wallet, I too had basically the same bar bill, but showed my bill being paid at 1:00 AM. We all had different drinks, rum and coke, double rum and coke, and margarita. To show the management, that I agree the first bill. However, my bill had the same drinks plus, the few drinks we added from midnight to 1:00. Bill should have been $250.00 total. Not $400!\nAs a result of this \""SCAM\"" I am giving the hotel bar 1! Even though it could have been an oversight on the bar tender and the waitress,accounting decided to ignor my many request!"
0,"I live right around the corner so I am here frequently. I've shopped at other F&Es as well both in Phoenix and Los Angeles and this one just isn't the same. Sure the product is, the layout is, but that's it. Today's experience was probably the worst I've had here in a while. Usually things are fine, I go in, get what I need, check out and go home. The employees are there but seemingly there just to take up space. Today however, it was very clear that I was inconveniencing them just by being in the store. They are out of plastic produce bags and when I asked them employee gives me attitude, doesn't say anything walks off. Another employee standing next to him said they were out but that he would get me a grocery bag. I finished my shopping and went to check out. I asked the very unfriendly employee at the registers if they had the Friends Card and was told they were out. I asked if they had any $25 gift cards, I was told they were out. I continued checking out and she begrudgingly bagged my groceries (without me asking, I would have rather done it myself. Um, ma'am, please don't bag my bottle of wine in the same bag as the tortilla chips.) and then walked off. Um, excuse me you just bagged 3 bottles of wine for me, do you think you could come over and authorize my purchase so I can leave? Ugh."
0,"Why did I come here? I already know how mediocre this place is and I still came.  Wet Burrito was flavorless and the manager said \""its great\"" and basically said I was wrong.  Casa Don Juan makes Macayo's seems like grandma's cooking.  Never coming back....this review is a reminder to myself!"
4,"I enjoy coming to Gallo Blanco for lunch.. The food here is excellent. I am Mexican and I don't consider this traditional per se.. It definitely has traditional Mexican picks but the way it's prepared and put together is a more modern take on some of my favorites. The guac is amazing! They add citrus bits which gives it an extra zingy taste, tacos are tiny but delish; I would eat them as an appetizer and not a meal. The pozole needs work, it is quite bland and could use some love. Service is always great, drinks are always full, and I never have to wait any more than 15 minutes for a table now that they have extended the seating area."
4,"You have to, have to, have to go here!  \n\nOn a recent trip to Las Vegas, I wanted my friend that lives there to take me somewhere where the locals hangout and this was our first stop.   I can't believe how many pinball games are here and the excellent condition.  I had forgotten so many of them but as I walked down the aisles it all came back.  The art work on the rear glass and cabinet, that loud \""thwack\"" for earning an extra game, feeling flipper button action...  pant, pant..   so I got a bit carried away.\n\nNeedless to say, the highlight of my time in Las Vegas.  I can't wait to go back."
1,Why is your gas at the pump still $3.30 when everyone else around 3.18
3,"We went for a business lunch on a Wednesday. The servers were attentive and speedy. Our group of 10 seemed to all enjoy their food. I had the vegetarian quesadillas.  They were very tasty and I had the biggest plate on the table. \nThe atmosphere was fun, but relaxing enough that we could talk to each other in normal voices. There were flat screen TVs in the corner running SportsCenter. I would love to come back and try the chimichangas. They looked amazing!"
1,"Ok so to start the food is actually really good and consistent. The reason i rated them lower is because of the customer service. I have been several times and usually have good service, however there is one waitress that needs to have customer service lessons. Im not sure her what her cultural background is but she is Asian, prob thirties or late twenties. The last time i went there was with a group of seven. On this occasion, there was plenty of seating but there was a sign to wait, so we did. There were two waitresses one was white and one was Asian, both saw us and continued working, one was even clean a table. The  after about 5 minutes the Asian lady came over to us and sat us at a table. The first thing she said to us is \""How are you planning to pay?\"" i thought that was really strange and kinda rude. Im used to waitress telling u about the menu before discussing money, we looked at each other with a puzzled look and answered her and that some of us were paying cash and some were paying credit cards. Right away she responded, \""i can't do that. I can only take up to 4 payments.\"" we tried to figure who had cash and if we needed to sit at separate tables in order to have lunch (literally talked about payment stuff for ten minutes before we were allowed to look at the menu) . After we go that worked out, she gave us a minute to look at the menu and came back and stood at the head of the table and requested our orders, requiring us to yell across the table to place our order over the noise. Isn't it a common technique of waiters to walk around the table and the order, unless your at a booth and there is sonly on place to stand? I felt it was rude. To make it easier, i placed my order over the phone as a to go order, that way she didn't have to worry  about splitting the bill and the number of payments she could take. To this day each of us talk about this experience and how we are not planning to go back. I really do like the food and want to go back but I'm tone on supporting that type of customer service. If I go back my order will be to go 100%. No need in staying there, i rather eat at the picnic table by the movie theater than be in there with that customer service and feel obligated to tip someone who isn't doing their job from a customer prospective. Overall I think they could improve their customer service, especially for seating. I typically wait about 5 minutes and every time i have gone it has always been between 2% and 25% full."
3,"I went to 15 North for a Tweetup, so I didn't have a full meal, just appetizers.  I must say, though, those appetizers were pretty tasty!  I will definitely go back for dinner.  The mini meatballs were excellent - and I'm an Italian from the Little Italy section of Wilmington, Delaware!  They make them just like we do - mixing beef, pork, veal and fennel seeds to make delectable little treats.  The prosciutto-wrapped asparagus drizzled with balsamic glaze were also very tasty!  The atmosphere was very cool as well - chic, but not uncomfortably so."
2,"My boyfriend and I flew out to Phoenix so he could meet my parents. After a really nice weekend with them, we thought it would be nice for him and I to cap it off by inviting them to a lovely Sunday brunch before we headed to the airport. It just so happened that Sunday coincided with Easter. I made my Sunday brunch reservations for the four of us over Opentable.com and the week before the reservation, I received a call from the restaurant asking me to confirm the reservation. They also asked for my credit card to hold the reservation.\n\nThe brunch itself was tasty and enjoyable. The service was great. But we were quick to learn upon our arrival that this was NOT the standard Sunday brunch. That for their holiday brunch, they automatically included a hot buffet, coffee, tea, and champagne for all guests. At first I thought this meant we would all have to pay $35-38 for the hot menu price.\n\nImagine our surprise when my boyfriend received the bill and it was $430 (including tax and a pre-included gratuity)! That means brunch for each of us cost over $100, which is a far cry from the advertised $35 brunch! \n\nShame on Wright's for not telling us about this beforehand. Why didn't they inform us that the buffet would be over 3 times the regular price for this holiday Sunday?\n\nWhile we enjoyed the brunch, I can't imagine we'll be back. At $110/person, this is not a good value for your money."
2,"Dos Gringos- Yo tengo Uno mano, dos cervezas, tres chicas y nunca tengo inabicciones. thats what its like here on a good night. on a bad night take out tres chicas and please insert tres numeros de telefonos de una servicia de sluts. Its actually a great place with the best deals around and a spot to watch the game and according to the sign, its also an offical border crossing."
0,"My husband has been staying for work for 2 weeks now. He had to return on he's 3rd week, he made reservations over the phone without a problem. Once he got there to check in they told him that he could not be checked in because of a disturbance that was entered by a staff that would be there in the morning.  When he asked, what was the disturbance they could not tell him. He works night and would sleep most of the day. He left for work since they told him there was nothing they could do till 6am. When he came back at 6am they told him he was banned from the hotel and could not comeback. Wtf!! Couldn't the person who made the reservation tell him over the phone. So my husband didn't have to make the long drive and had to work all night and not able to stay the morning??? Who does that?? Only unprofessional staff that doesnt give a rats ass about their guest. Besides the motel being full of prostitutes and dirty. I would give this a 0 star rating with their bed bugs and all.. I personally would never stay there, my husband had no choice. He's work has an account with motel 6 and I think that's absurd."
1,"The Beautiful Carin and I were out and about this past Sunday evening. She was recovering from some sort of bug and had a little craving for something sweet.\nI would love to give Sprinkles another star (or even 2...I am a generous and thoughtful person:) for being open Sunday evening, when no one else was (and I do mean no one...we tried See's, anywhere else, etc...no dice).\nWe went in and I swear, they had at least 10 employees behind the counter...Chief Greeting Officer, assistant to the greeter, Chief Order Taking Officer, assistant order taker, Chief Cupcake Hander Outer, assistant cupcake hander outer, Chief Money taker, and her assistant...you kind of begin to see why they charge $34 a pop for the cupcakes (no, not really...I'm exaggerating for \""comic effect\""...the cupcakes are only $20 each:)\nBut they had a ton of folks working there...and when the door to the kitchen (I can't really call it a bakery) opened, there must have been another 15 oompa-loompa's scurrying around in there, mixing, icing, sprinkling, etc.\nWith all that, you'd think they could make the best cupcake in the universe...no, not even close.\nOn Sunday, they had the added advantage of being the only ones to show up for work and they still couldn't beat the locals. \nI will say that the cupcakes seemed better than the last time (although still sub-par)...fresher...but I frankly attribute that to the fact that they were the only game in town and the cupped cakes weren't sitting around as long.\nSadly, still 2 stars, even if they were the only place that was open."
4,"Not usually on yelp much! But I figured I would get on and review Pasta Brionis. Last week I called in a pick up order to grab on my way home from work. Called in an order for the to-go side. Spoke with a lady on the\nPhone and didn't catch her name. The customer service was outstanding! Just even in the phone. I ordered the eggplant dinner. Was a little hesitant because I've never tried eggplant. The way she explained was the way it tasted! Amazing! Ordered spaghetti and meatballs for the kids. Tasted it and the meatballs were fresh and moist just how I like! \n\nThursday evening my husband and I went on our \""monthly\"" date night! He was out of town when I ordered Togo so was unable to try the food! So we go and a young gentleman greeted us and sat us at a booth. The server took our drink order, the house wine delicious! I'm not a huge drinker, but wow! We ordered the Veal Parmesan and the Dumplings. (Shared) I got the Rigatoni con pollo on Chefs menu. All were soo good! Had left overs for two days. I highly recommend dining here. The staff makes the experience even better! Go Pasta Brionis! Will be back!"
1,"Lackluster, flavorless breakfast. Do not go out of your way to come here. I was shocked at how many people were waiting to eat here. I ordered the poached eggs with toast and potatoes. They overcooked the eggs; a place with the word EGG in the title should be able to properly poach an egg. The potatoes were very basic and sad. The bacon my dad ordered was fatty and kinda undercooked. The big killer is that the prices were more expensive than a diner yet the quality of the food was the same."
1,"Not enough staff is on hand the two times I have been in to properly pay attention to paying customers. I agree that the portions have shrunk over the years, and the effort is no longer there. It is convenient to have nearby but not worth my time when other great restaurants are around. Wish I could rate it better but it's just not that good at all."
2,Always packed. Suuuuuper straight. Very very very loud. Tasty food.
2,"My husband and I checked the place out for the first time on a First Friday (http://www.artlinkphoenix.com/alp/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=27) and were really impressed by the setup - the house right on the corner has a huge circular bar in front of it and the house on the left is the actual restaurant (with 4-5 tables in front for outdoor dining). The outdoor area was filled with people sipping drinks and waiting to be seated and the vibe felt really hip and urban, just like the artwalk taking place in the surrounding streets. \n\nThere was a wait for a table, so we put our name down. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the hostess isn't particularly warm and is actually a bit snippy. I don't think it makes the place seem more desirable if the staff is aloof and plays hard to get, but hey, maybe some people fall for that. We then walked over to get a drink at the bar. I tried the Pad Thai martini (a mix of lemongrass and basil, I think it was). It was strong, for sure, but for $12, I expected a slightly larger portion. The flavor was also really strong (very herbal) and not particularly tasty. \n\nWe were seated inside after about 20 minutes of waiting, which wasn't too bad given how busy the area was for First Friday. Unfortunately, however, we were seated at this high, communal table - across from each other, but sandwiched (literally) between two other parties. We didn't necessarily have a problem with this arrangement, but what did piss us off was how *ridiculously* uncomfortable the bar stools were. They were made out of this hard metal criss-cross material and literally dug into the backs of our thighs. My husband commented that they should have sat on them before they decided they would make sense for seating during a meal. On a positive note, the inside was decorated in this really cool urban-loft style and being so close to the kitchen created a really homey feel (although on this 110-degree night, we couldn't \""stand the heat\"" but couldn't really \""get out of\"" or away from the kitchen). \n\nOur server was friendly enough and the food was definitely decent. For our appetizer, we tried the Thai spring rolls - the rice paper was the right softness and the dipping sauce was awesome, but the rolls were literally stuffed with vermicelli and contained just one miniscule shrimp each. The entrees - the shrimp sesame salad and chicken Xa ho Fun noodles - were definitely good but nothing mindblowing. The veggie selection in the noodles seemed random and not necesarily well-thought-out. The sauce on the noodles was tasty and perfectly spicy, but there was too much of it, so the noodles got kind of soggy. The salad was also overdressed, and the dressing was too salty. However, the shrimp in the salad was amazing quality - we've had a lot of bad shrimp here in Phoenix, so this was a huge plus. To sum it up, for every positive we encountered in our food, there was a drawback. \n \nActually, now that I stop and think about it, the whole negative-for-every-positive thing kind of describes our whole experience at Fate. We loved the bar area but weren't big fans of the drinks. We appreciated the cool vibe of waiting outside a house to be seated but weren't thrilled with how inhospitable the hostess was. We thought the inside of the restaurant was well-presented but hated the imprints those horrible stools left on our thighs. We thought some aspects of the food were great but that others were sub-par. Didn't love all of it, but didn't hate all of it. Three stars."
1,"Whole Foods represents more than high quality food, it also represents great service.  Unfortunately, this WF doesn't stack up.   BOO!\n\n1 STAR for a huge location and neat and organized store. \n1 STAR for having an OK selection of cheeses - but could be better. \n\n-3 STARS for POOR POOR POOR service.  The folks at the bakery, cheese counter and check out are terribly unfriendly, not service conscious, and poor at making suggestions.  \n\nWhole Foods is for people who are ingredient conscious, highly selective, and willing to pay the price - at least staff with people who can cater to this crowd in the specialty sections!!!  \n\nParking is competitive and crowded at this lot.\n\nOnly shop here if you know what you are looking for..."
0,"All I can say is disgusting. Spent the evening trying out the different food joints and the wine bar. First off the other food joints have a decent product. And the wine bar some pretty nice wines.\nSo the reason I am writing this review, Big Erns, disgusting. First off, during my travels through the park I saw one of the cooks getting drunk at the wine bar and then at the taco shop. When I saw him at big erns never saw him wash his hands. To me that's just disgusting. So to say the least I didn't order any food, just beware when you eat there."
4,I came here to catch some March Madness before a Yelp Elite event I was going to be attending next door. I was helped immediately upon walking up to the bar by a handsome bartender named Matt who greeted me with a huge smile and a awesome attitude. Best part was he recommended a delicious jameson cocktail that I of course don't recall the name of but he promised it would be delicious. Once he made the drink for me he even waited to make sure I liked it first. To me that doesn't happen enough now a days where a bartender actually knows how to earn their tips. Matt wasn't the only guy who was friendly behind the bar another hottie was back there named Shaun(Shawn) Im terrible with names but he was really friendly too and able to make me laugh which is always a win. I know they have casino games and beer pong and tons of people looked like they were having a great time. I can only review the experience I had at the bar and it was a good one!!! I look forward to coming back with some friends!
1,"Booo!! I was super excited to check out the food trucks that I religiously watched battle it out on the food network. First off, I would like to start with the good. \n\nGOOD: \nThere was a huge effort by the festival to provide shade in the dining area. \n\nBad: \n-The lack of shade waiting in the hour+ lines for food. I saw one girl actually faint! \n-No one was selling sun screen so I had to buy a $10 umbrella and look silly \n-I was deeply disappointed by the food quality and attitudes of the frustrated food truck workers. My \""gourmet\"" grilled cheese I waited over an hour for was soggy, made with the wrong bread and had tomato on it which I specified I didn't want. \n- Water was 1.50 at some trucks but $3 at others\n- The DJ was incredibly loud. \n\nWith admission, my boyfriend and I spent over $80 on food (taste/quality) we could have made at home. \n\nI wont be back next year."
3,It's a great place to save some money. Located in the Kohl's'Target shopping center.
0,"This is without a doubt, the WORSE Verizon Wireless store in the valley.  Go elsewhere if you want polite, nice customer service.  All verizon wireless stores leave a lot to be desired, but this one rates a 0 in reality, not a 1 star."
0,"Harassment with a smile...well not as much! Very poor customer service, not very helpful and mean when someone sets off the metal detector. I think they should have private security like they have in SFO....TSA should change their motto to \""People are not our specialty\""\n\nI had the honor of one of these fine guys stick their finger up my butt because he believed I had a bulge on the back of my pants. I was fondled also...not a good way to start my vacation!"
4,"Gil was so friendly, super professional.  The New Mexico enchiladas were delish!!!! Hands down for this place!!!!"
1,"I have never been so disappointed with an olive garden before. So I arrive in the parking lot and the outside looks like your typical Olive Garden. Walk in side and it is very open and very rustic looking a plus the chairs are on wheels which I'm not used to but was kind of cool. As usual the wait staff is very friendly and polite. I ordered the bottomless pasta bowl I first had the three cheese marinara with penne pasta and Italian sausage. the sauce was almost non existent and I had to slice the sausage myself and the penne pasta was mushy but I decided to try something else so I got the Alfredo with penne and meatballs. The Alfredo was tasteless surprising because Alfredo is usually always good the penne that time was good but they forgot to salt it during the boiling part. The breadstick were delicious because it is pre made all the have to do is bake it. The chicken gnocchi soup taste good as soon as it cooled and the lasagna fritta didn't taste good till it was coeld. I feel sorry for the waiter cause he could tell that I was not happy, because of him I give it two stars."
4,"This is hands down the best thai food in Pittsburgh! Chef joy is very personable and treats every guest like royalty. The Tom ka soup is so wonderful, with fresh lime juice! Amazing! The portions are the perfect size, and the atmosphere is softly lit and comfortable . You could bask in the delciousness for hours! It's BYOB too, so grab a bottle of wine and friends- you be in for a great night!"
3,"I grabbed dinner and some brews at Daily Dose Midtown with my friend last night. Great food, great beers, great prices! The burger was exquisite, and with the happy hour prices going 4-9 daily, my adoration for places like Smashburger is in peril.\nI'm looking forward to future meals at Daily Dose, and plan on returning super soon!"
4,"XS is one of the better clubs in Vegas and has a gorgeous venue with the huge pool and outdoor bars. They play a good variety of music and the go-go dancers are pretty hot. The crowd differs but sometimes you run into obnoxious people or guys who are looking for a fight. I've seen the fights and champagne being dumped on people. Yes, the drinks are overpriced and yeah, it's flooded with Asians (I am Asian and I don't give a crap) but if you don't like it, go to a different club. It can get insanely crowded and I can't believe people wait in that ridiculous line to get in. Get to know the right people so you can skip the line and get in w/o any entrance charge. 5 stars because Vegas puts up a great looking club and I don't have to spend any $ on entrance or drinks just cuz I'm a girl :)"
0,The worst dinner. I ordered the skate fish which was ammonia ridden to the point of making me nauseous. The waiter didn't seem surprised when brought to his attention. The manager came over but was not in any way apologetic. Absolutely no concern was shown as she couldn't be bothered by such serious food and health issues. I am thinking should at least bring this to the attention of health department.
0,No stars for Hash A Go Go.  We waited over 45 minutes for frozen sunny side eggs.  We asked for a new order only to be served more frozen sunny side eggs.  Avoid if Salmonella is not your thing.
2,"Wooooow the portions are sooooo big!!!! Everything you order is oversized!!! I couldn't finish a thing, which would've been nice if I had somewhere to take it back. But we hit the road right after (not smart, as we all got struck with massive food coma after our meal here), so unfortunately a lot went to waste :(\n\nMy friend and I shared the chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was nice. Crispy skin, juicy meat. Very enjoyable. The waffles were whatever. I expected a lot more out of them, but they're just waffles. This dish comes with a lot of just random things on it, I suppose for aesthetics. But you will really just ignore all that filler stuff. We just had to try it because it was a famous dish at a famous restaurant. 3/5 ratings because it wasn't amazing, but it was still good.\n\nThe wait was long, so they were giving out free mimosas and bloody marys! We were still recovering from our weekend.. So we really didn't take part in that offer.. But I thought it was nice. The atmosphere is very loud, and the waiters are always hustling. I recommend sharing your plates, because the portions are seriously gigantic. Don't know how one person could eat all that food!"
0,"I used Care With Confidence for my elderly mother. I was extremely disappointed in both the caregiver and company owner.  In my opinion the caregiver, Lily, was unprofessional, fell asleep on the couch while caring for my mother, and was extremely lazy.  The owner did not follow through on resolving an issue for us. I would not recommend this company."
2,"Overall, a nice Italian restaurant in the South Point Hotel. Elegant and comfortable atmosphere, good service and good food.  \n\nWith the opening carb basket, they serve a tasty italian \""chutney\"" of olive oil, diced tomatoes and roasted garlic ... Super delicious on the warm slices of bread!\n\nI ordered their cioppino, and it was really quite yummy. Came in a huge bowl and was chock full of various sea-dwelling creature pieces. The broth was very flavorful.  I would order this again. My date had the chicken parm, which was fine. Not particularly impressive, but fine.\n\nIf I was in the area, I would happily eat here again,l but wouldn't travel out of my way to this perfectly fine but less-than-awesome Italian restaurant."
4,"Always good. Tonight on impulse walked there and back on a crowded Friday. Won about $80 for $20  on machine at bar. Not bad, even if my sandwich was no good."
4,"Expect to splurge on this, but it is worth EVERY penny!\n\nWe did a helicopter ride to the Grand Canyon.  Whole experience takes half of a day.  A van will pick you up at your hotel (and make stops at other hotels along the way) and then there is a 45 minute -1 hour ride to the airport.  They have you watch a short safety video and then you head out.\n\nThe actual flight is amazing and there are great views of the Grand Canyon.  The pilot was friendly and gave a short narrative/tour on the flight.  We landed in the Canyon at their own landing site and the pilot served us a light snack and champagne.  \n\nGreat alternative to spending the whole day driving to the Canyon/Hoover Dam from Vegas!"
4,"After living near DC for 8 years, I absolutely caught the cravings for Ethiopian food.  Where else can you eat delicious meat and vegetable curries served on spongy pancakes?  I admit it is a cuisine that either you love or you hate; count me in for some love.\n\nThat said, I had not been near a good Ethiopian restaurant in almost 5 years since we moved to San Francisco.  When our friends suggested Meskerem in Charlotte, there was no hestitation.  YES.\n\nThe food was excellent, the service adorably friendly, and the environment perfect: a tiny restaurant with a few booths and huge plates.  We devoured two Meskerem Combos and a Veggie Combo between the four of us.\n\nI even asked if they do the Ethiopian coffee ceremony, and sure enough they will!  Meskerem, we will be back."
1,"I was introduced to First Flight by my friend who is based in CLT with Nascar. He had to take me there because he raved over the sushi and the sake. When I was flying out of there not in my uniform I gave it a shot. It's strategically placed in CLT where the main food court is after security. Make no mistake, it looks like a bar. BUT you can get sushi and sashimi to go on the fly at the walk up area and pay at the bar. I just wasn't that impressed. I tried to keep in mind that it is sushi.. in a airport.. and IN Charlotte. Because I grew up near the sea where the sushi is still squealing , or whatever sushi would do if they could yell, I am, without a doubt pretty picky about my sushi. Sake is sake. It's strong..hot.. and can jack you up before flying if your not cautious. Well, I felt that way about the sushi. I don't care how sweet Carolina the staff is, and they all are! I truly hoped I made it through this 5 hour flight home with no sushi remorse."
1,"ONLY went here since we were crunched for time and had to find something close and quick. NEVER again. LOUD, too much hustle and bustle walking around. Not bad food, just your typical chain style fare.\n\nAgain, as I said,,,,never again."
2,"The Lane (formally Berlin) was always one of those really 'cool' places that I always felt too intimidated to go to. As I used to work in a nightclub in Edinburgh, I always heard rumours about Berlin - and not too favourable ones. But I actually quite liked it. The music is very indie (well, it was on the night I was there, but I'm told that it changes) and the club itself wasn't too shabby. the staff were brilliant - Richie, the manager, in particular was a great host and you didn't feel like you were in a club. Yeah it was a bit dingy, but nothing that a lick of paint couldn't help.\n\nThey have a great night called Diva for all the girls out there, and I thoroughly recommend that too. Drinks were cheap-ish and overall was quite good fun!"
0,"The hotel has a very confusing layout. Had to go to the back of the hotel to mess around with the parking. The parking garage is very small and confusing. The lobby was like entering a set of a 1970s tv show. Mirror chandeliers and out dated carpet. The check in line was very long and they only had 4 people checking guests in. I requested top floor and only got 17! I received 5749. I said there was no way that the room was on the 57th floor because the building didn't even look like it past 20 floors. We walked to the elevators which are beyond outdated. Scratched and scrapped up gold walls and Mirrors, doors and floors. I looked at the wall of buttons to push my floor and it had numbers 47-61? With arrows and other room numbers. I pushed 57 which is where my room was.  Got off and the sign in the hall said 17th floor but all the other signage says 57 but clearly we were not 57 stories high above the Vegas nightlife. It is extremely confusing and makes no friggin sense. That's all I ever heard the other guests complain about. The room we got was a \""luxury\"" in the \""renovated\"" Monoco tower. \""Renovated is an understatement! I think the last time it was update was in the 90's. The carpet on the halls was stained. The room doors are an old wood type very dark and ugly. The room was worse. It smells like mold as door are you open the door. The room was certainly not \""luxury\"" nor updated. The bathroom was terrible. Ugly old 1970's yellow bathroom tile and shower and old outdated bathroom fixtures. The shower head was the worst I ever had in a hotel. Everything in the room was dirty. The rugs the ceiling in the bathroom stains on the carpet. The desk and the pictures looked like it hadn't been dusted in years! The windows were absolutely disgusting and dirty. The view was pretty good except the view of the ugly buildings and dumpsters but overall it was a nice view. The bed was pretty comfortable I was surprised. The fridge didn't work and we had to tell them 3 times to replace it and they never did! We came one night and there was absolutely no parking! All the garages were filled and even valet was full! The one night we did valet the car it took almost 30 mins to get the car. And they were very short handed.  I didn't have any change to tip on me except a large bill so I went in the hotel to front desk and asked for change and the older lady told me no and I had to walk to the casino which was on the other side of the hotel to the cage to break it. Really? You can't give me some change? I'll never come back to this place. The casino was horrible. They advertise $1 blackjack and only have it On 1 table! Really? And they only had 3-4 other BJ tables but the min was $25. Really? The slots sucked and so did the players club which gave me a. $3.00 crappy shirt for joining and spending all my money in their hotel. The restaurants suck and are fast food places. Please update it. You can still have the history and old charm if you just update the dam place! Absolutely the worst! Save your time and energy and stay and play somewhere else!"
4,"Imagine waking into a Denny's but instead of trying to win an ugly stuffed animal from a grabber game, you can play cheap craps and blackjack. What's even better is the food. I ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs and breakfast potatoes. Also, got a side order of pancakes. I ordered the corn beef hash extra crispy. If you prefer crispy textures, order the hash this way. Everything was good, if not really good. The corn beef hash had great flavor and appropriate seasoning (not too salty). The breakfast potatoes were good with a nice crispy pop with each bite. I also was impressed with the pancakes, mostly with the texture. Nice and crispy on the outside and light fluffiness in the outside. \n\nAn overall great value for food you can eat anytime of the day. Plus, if you're down on your vegas strip, Ellis island is the place to go because it's cheap and where you can overcome your wallows with hit the spot kinda of food."
3,"Good choice for brunch, especially sitting at the patio. Love the Egg Norwegian. The trio Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e after is perfect and cute."
0,this place sucks big time invited by one of the host here for a comped suit  lost 8600 palyin here and still got charged 1250.00 for 2 nights i will defienitly not be back very disapointed mr maloof
1,"I had the pleasure of eating at Mesa Grill in the Bahamas and enjoyed ever bite. The food was spectacular and the steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The service was also a top notch experience. \n\nNow on to Vegas:\nWhile on a mini family vacation (cheer tournament) in Vegas with my wife and kids I thought it would be great for the family to enjoy what I had the opportunity to enjoy in Bahamas. After checking yelp and calling ahead to see when Mesa closed we promptly arrived at 10:30. After hustling my kids by the questionable statues in Caesars the Romans call art. Did I also mention that we passed Nobu's and Rao's on our way to Mesa. All because I thought my family would enjoy what I fell in love with in the Bahamas.  \n\nAfter being greeted by the receptionist she politely informed me that the Resturant was closed for the night (Saturday) and all of waiters that could serve us were let go early. I asked her politely is there anyway that someone could serve us because my family and I traveled 400 miles just to eat at Mesa grill. She politely smiled and said no. At this time my family was hunger crabby and looked at me like \""we should have stopped at some sub par Resturant on the strip\"". After walking away defeated like I just climbed Mount Rushmore with no one to greet me at the top I walked outside with my family and reviewed the hours of operation that said \""Mesa grill closes at 11pm\"". I then walked back into the restaurant and asked again politely to someone standing by the polite hostess and they finally said OK. \n\nBobby if your reading this.... I love your food that much to walk back in the same Resturant that turned away my family of five away before official closing hours. \n\nThank goodness for the second hostess/ manager who seated us. In addition the food was spectacular and the service was incredible. The server saved the day for me. Just couldn't believe that the hostess was ready to turn away a $450 check."
1,"This is the most incompetently run company I have ever given thousands of dollars to.\n\nThe merchandise is simple, but stylish. No complaints there, that's why I added the extra star.\n\nThe customer service is deplorable. The employees are consistently rude. It's actually impressive that so many people could collectively care less about helping their customers. \n\nCommunication is terrible. I had a piece of furniture on back order for six weeks. Those six weeks pass and no furniture arrived. I called the labyrinthine customer service center and got the news that the piece would remain on back order for another eight weeks.\n\nI proactively called around to a few other locations and was able to track down the piece at another location. Would have been nice for the person who sold me the piece originally to think of that, but I think paragraph three up above has that concern covered already. Two weeks later the piece arrived completely damaged. Damaged merchandise happens, not necessarily the store's fault, but spending the next two hours on the phone with a customer service department that is clearly paid by the number of calls they transfer could have been avoided. \n\nAs much as I like the store's style, I'll save myself the stress and shop elsewhere going forward."
2,This location does not have a drive-thru but they have ample parking and the service is fast.
1,This place has been going down hill. The food quality is getting worse and worse. The servers are trying to make it a better experience but the food is just disappointing. Skip this place if you can until they either fix with what's wrong in the kitchen.
4,"Good bunt cakes, friendly staff, fairly quick on preparations"
1,"Nice place..I mean I really like it...except...The way you run your shit! How can you hire a bunch of douchebag guys that talk to people like their assholes? Yeah I told the security guard to go \""F\"" himself but that's only cuz he was rude when I was trying to be ever so polite. Also, $68 bucks for fout Jager bombs!? Seriously!? I thought this was a recession period, not an inflation period....Go fuck yourself Pure!"
1,"Uhhh, I think my neighbor is on crack.  He said, \""Julio G's is the best!...blah blah blah...the food is so good...blah blah blah\""  When he should have said, \""Dude, stay the hell away from Julio G's, their steak effing tastes like cardboard.\""\n\nI'd give it 1 star, but I reserve that for restaurants that have exceptionally bad service as well as food. J.G's had decent service, awful food.\n\nI can't think of a single good reason to go to Julios G's."
1,"Had the Thai spicy noodle, it was baaaaad. I asked them for another dish to replace it and they had the chef come out and tell me it was my fault that it tasted \""sour\"" because I put the red chili sauce on it. Obviously that was not the reason, but eventually they did replace it with the panang curry, which was delicious. My friend also had the spicy basil which was really good. Overall I was a disappointed in the service but selective dishes were good. Your call if you want to try this place out."
2,"I have been here twice now. First time it seemed expensive so I avoided it for a long time. In search of something different we ventured here again and while it wasn't as expensive as I remember the food just wasn't quite on. \n\nMargaritas: way too much sour. I didn't finish mine. That never happens. \n\nEmpanadas: seemed frozen/reheated\n\nDates: can't go wrong here. Tasty but only 4\n\nTenderloin from tapas: tasty. Potatoes weren't the real deal but I thought it was good enough. There was something cheap about the steak. \n\nCorn cakes: sugar bomb. I honestly didn't taste anything corn about these guys. They were dressed with maple syrup seemed more like a pancake. The bf enjoyed them so they got a few points. \n\nAll in all, tapas are no bueno. I will try one more time because I like the area, but I'll go for an item off the menu -- sandwich or entre."
0,"Do not come here!!! 1 hour wait when half the tables were empty. Groups that checked in after us were served and done by the time we got seated. I write this review as we're 2 hours in and I'm still waiting for my food. There is no excuse for this. We're only a party of 6. Honestly, will never waste my vacation time here again."
3,"I'll start by admitting that I am not a NASCAR fan. That aside, I had a really great time at the NASCAR Hall of Fame. This visit was added to our itinerary because one of my travel companions is a big NASCAR fan. Having seen my first race the day before, I think I was better able to appreciate the museum. I enjoyed that I was able to pick my personal tour guide (I picked Kasey Kahne) for the audio portions of the visit. Really enjoyed seeing all the different cars, both the actual cars and models. My favorite part though was where we got to pretend to be a pit crew and get timed performing the various pit crew tasks. I'm glad we visited and you should consider stopping here if you are sightseeing in Charlotte."
3,"Yay! I think I finally found a cool dive bar close to work to frequent. I stopped in a couple of weeks ago for an early happy hour/quick bite to eat. I was a little nervous about ordering food from the appearance of the outside of the bar. My kind of place to drink, but not necessarily to eat. The inside looks better, but still dark and bar like. I asked to see the menu and was surprised to see the selections, and even more surprised by the pastrami sandwich I had. It was tasty. The best part was the bread, grilled to perfection. I would definitely recommend a cocktail and a bite to eat at the Q. \n\nI wasn't there long enough to give it a 5, so I'm going back today to try it again. If you drive by that area, stop in and give it a try."
4,"Second day of cross county trip and my Van dies outside of Phoenix. Found Litchfield Auto using Yelp.\nCalled was told to have it towed, would check it out, was able to drive the Van there the next morning.  Owner was ready to jump right on the van as we were traveling  but told him I would like to leave it, as we rented a car to finish our trip and would be back in a week. Spoke to the shop two times while we were gone, both times was told they could not find anything wrong, and did not want to just throw new parts in and not solve the problem. When we got back, the Van was running fine, but still no obvious problems with it.  The owner discussed what he found or did not find testing the van. We both came to the conclusion that the fuel pump may have overheated, due to low gas levels.  This is Astro/Safari vans which are known for weak fuel pumps, and most people just keep having fuel pumps put in at $300-500 a pop.  I have always worked on my own cars, and in fact had replaced the fuel pump a year earlier myself.  \nThis place is great, and a truly honest Repair shop, I will recommend them to everyone in the area.\nI have told people on the AstroSafari forum that this is the place to go if you have problems in Phoenix area.\nMy only regret is that they are too far away from my home to use."
1,"45 minutes between clearing appetizers & being served dinner. Extremely disappointed in meal & service. Went here a few times years ago months after it's opening when both food & service were phenomenal. Seems like different place, so we'll be going elsewhere in the future."
0,Subpar! Feels like a Cracker Barrel that serves dinner. Not worth $. Menu was POORLY executed! Sounded good on paper (& that's a stretch) tasted horrid!  I would expect better from a Four Seasons...
0,"Worst customer service award= Best Buy Tempe Marketplace! I called the store to inquire about replacing a lemon TV they just sold me. 1 hour later, after being on hold and transferred 4 times, I was told that I need to lug the TV back in... And then the call was disconnected. Really? After an hour on hold with zero customer service, I will be returning to the store... And they can have the joy of dealing with me in person. I'll make sure to never spend a dollar here again- there are other places that actually care about delivering quality products and services to customers!"
1,I love the food. But they have the worst policy when it comes to splitting checks. We went there with some friends who were out visiting and they put up a huge fight just to split the check. We then went there again tonight with my mom who is visiting and again the put up a huge fight to split the check. The waiter had the worst additude about it. Sad we will not be returning here again.
1,"Lets first start with the ambiance. The furniture and decor was outdated. It was dark, gloomy, and far from elegant being the prices were more then your average restaurant. It needs a lot of gordon ramsays help to fix this restaurant. The service was average, if that. We started with the shirazi salad which contained diced cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, a little bit of EVOO, and a tremendous amount of lemon juice. It was very difficult to enjoy with the sour/tart aftertaste. Since this was our first time, we decided to order the chefs special platter. It contained chicken breast kebob, ground beef Kebob, and lamb Kebob. On top of that we also ordered the shish Kebob platter. This platter contained \""filet mignon\"" Kebob (biggest lie, filet mignon isn't a thin strip of meat which is tough, unless they don't know how to cook it), another chicken breast Kebob and lamb Kebob. We ordered these platters for some variety, but the funny thing is, there was no variety. All of the meats were marinated in the same spices/sauce that in result, didn't allow us to differentiate between all of the different meats. I am a foody and I cook traditional shish Kebob at home, being that I am from the Middle East. This restaurant does not deserve to sell and advertise their horribly tasting Kebobs. Having said that, their basmati rice was my favorite dish. That is why I'm generous enough to give them two stars. In conclusion, 6 skewers of the same exact tasting meats, a huge portion of basmati rice, small bowl of salad, and two hot teas costed roughly 120 dollars with tip. Don't waste your time and gas. You would have a better service at McDonald's."
3,Indoor & Outdoor dining with drive in and drive threw type service.  Food is always good.  Never had slow service.  They have 1/2 off drinks between 2-4p
4,"Went back to VBar this weekend. Had a great time as usual. The service was top notch. Me and the boys don't really go out unless we're getting a table somewhere and Jorge always makes sure we get taken care of. What's nice about this place is even if bottle service isn't your thing, it's still spacious enough to have a good time. The DJ spins hip hop on Saturdays and unlike most DJ booths these days you can actually put in a request; and he'll play it. The crowd ebbs and flows so even if you show up and it's slow all I can say is don't leave because the party always appears just when you think it might not. I've gone out to all the biggest venues in Vegas for the last decade, but now I'm over the super club and much prefer the upscale bar/ultra lounge scene. Right now VBar is my stop at least once every trip."
4,"I love subway, I usually go to one on Cheyenne, but I discovered this one on my way to the grocery store. I'm always annoyed with the lack of products at the other location, so I tried this one out.\n\nThe employees were very friendly,chatty and I didn't have to repeat myself. They had all their products fully stocked and they actually had AVACADO!!!! \n\nI will now always come here!"
3,"Jekyl and Hyde is probably my favorite bar in the South Side. Why? It is not frequented by the high heeled drunk girls and their popped collar boyfriends. Yes. I'm a bar snob.\n\nBest of all, the place has a year-round Halloween theme. The interior reminds me of a haunted house... but with sports playing on the TVs. Jekyl has a decent beer selection at great prices, too. Their well drinks all have a corresponding \""spooky\"" name.  On Saturdays, a DJ livens the place up with dance hits and there are often free taster shots on weekends. \n\nAll in all, its a great dive bar with a haunted twist."
3,"I thoroughly enjoyed the food- they serve large portions and mine was very good. I ate a combination plate of chile relleno, enchilada, and tostada there. The only thing bad about the food was they served it when it was still way too hot to eat. Although they got me the food fast, I would have preferred if they had let it cool down slightly before bringing it to the table. I also had some of their margaritas. I really can't complain because the price is so good. I've had better margaritas, but for under $2, that's a pretty good deal. The waiter came by frequently and it was a pleasant experience. It's a fairly loud venue so it's good for a fun night out but not as good if you prefer more intimate conversation."
1,"Food was great, as usual, but management really needs to do something about the service. Every time we come here for lunch we wait and wait and wait. There are usually only 1-2 servers downstairs and half the time they cant be found. Its ridiculous.  Then, they leave tables full of the dishes from previous customers and take forever to get them cleared off. Its actually quite disgusting. \n\nManagement: get a clue!"
0,"ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. This store is such a joke. I've shopped at Best Buy before... not for any major purchases, usually just for CDs or DVDs, never had any problems until now.\n\nI decided to buy a computer from them. Biggest waste of time/money. First of all, their \""computer experts\"" couldn't tell me anything about the computers that wasn't written on the little spec cards on the displays. But i had done my own research, so i thought I was making a good choice. I also bought it \""optimized\"" which is where for $39.99 they have Geek Squad go through and get rid of the programs that you dont need and do all of the updates. \n\nI got home, and right off the bat had problems with the computer. It was shutting off randomly, wasn't downloading programs correctly... pretty much just a bad product. I returned it today, which brings me to...\n\nTheir HORRENDOUS customer service. They checked over the computer and did declare that it was defective. Then they told me that they would refund my money... minus the $39.99 for the optimization, because \""labor charges are non-refundable\"". Well that's great, except for the fact that they sold me a DEFECTIVE product, AFTER I paid them extra to make sure that it wasn't defective! But they really had a hard time understanding that. I had to talk to a salesgirl and two managers, one who had to call a higher up. For $40. come on people. I think I fought with them for a half an hour. They were ridiculously rude, and really had nothing to say except \""it's our policy not to refund labor charges\"". Long story short, I eventually was reimbursed the full amount and was rid of the POS computer. \n\nLast time I EVER shop at ANY Best Buy"
3,"I don't know what else to say other than this is a huge warehouse that has tons of pinball games.  Old, new (The Iron Man 2 game is AWESOME!!!) this place has so much cool stuff and they all have description of the machines on them (where they're from, a little history, etc.). It's fun just to watch some of the guys that work there play a game or two.\n\nThis is how I like to lose my money in Vegas!"
3,"Bonne petite place pour manger du cor\u00e9en pas cher du tout. Max 30 places assis, vous pouvez aussi prendre pour apporter. Attention, pour les gens qui aiment les resto propre propre, la partie vers les toilettes fait peur. Aussi il y avait un cheveux dans notre assiete, mais bon c'est des choses qui arrivent! \n\nJe suis desole, pas de photo du menu et de nos plats car j'ai manqu\u00e9 de batterie, mais je vais faire une description exaustive. Nous avons test\u00e9 le jus de riz, mmm que dire, c'etait tres sucr\u00e9 et il y avait une tonne de morceaux de riz (je suppose) alors je ne recommande pas, a moins que vous aimez l'aventure des textures.

Puis une entr\u00e9e de patates douces, courgette, champignon, crevette, etc frits dans une pate fine, c'etait wow pour 5$. Repas principal, une soupe ramen a la coreen bien sur au boeuf, le bouillon etait savoureux, et l'oeuf poch\u00e9 amenait un petit plus. Et un saut\u00e9 au boeuf et legumes, qui etait bon mais rien de special. Le riz blanc etait cuit a la perfection, collant comme j'aime. Je vais y retourner malgr\u00e9 tout!"
0,"We just moved in together after my Girlfriend/fiance lived here for over a year. She said it they used to care about their customers. \n\nManagement knew you by name, issues were resolved, and the grounds were well kept. \n\nWe have been here since Mid May 2012 and have had nothing but issues with the staff, and requests for repairs. The Repair staff is phenominal. The process to get the simplest request done takes 2-3 times as long usually due to management dropping the ball.\n\nWe made a payment on time through their system and it not only posted late we got to pay an additional 100 bucks in fees, which the office would not bother crediting even though it was their error. There bill pay switched over and after speaking directly with their systems operator/company they verified it was their error. But we were still out an extra 100. \n\nWe were up front with them about two pets moving in. We told them we would not renew if our pets weren't allowed. We were told by management everything was fine. Two months into the lease and only after we were attacked by a neighbors dog, my hand and my smaller dogs face, resolved, not on the leash and not even listed on the property, we received a notice of unauthorized dogs on the property. After confronting the office it turns out they messed up but we now get to pay an additional 51 a month. Even though according to our agreement that cost is already factored in... \n\nNeedless to say after numerous headaches with the office staff having very poor customer service, after ripping us off, we are now seeking legal action to garner back our costs spent and have also contacted The Better Business Bureau. \n\nI would not recommend this property to anyone. The cabinets are cheap, the appliances in the kitchen were new, the dryer and washer were old. Stains on carpet when we moved in and after requesting a price to replace we were quoted over 900 dollars out of pocket to replace carpet we were renting. \n\nThe grounds are well kept, and the community is really sketchy, I have seen a man pummel a women and after I threatened him to lay off her he just flat out said \""I don't care, seems to be the slogan of the Broadstone Ahwatukee Fairways. We went from a rent of about 845 a month to now almost 1000 a month and due to poor insulation about 200 in electric a month in SRP bills. \n\nThere are better apartments and I highly recommend you keep looking. 700-900 in Ahwatukee can find you a lot better."
1,"how do you spell ghetto?in this case it is spelled A-M-C R-A-I-N-B-O-W P-R-O-M-E-N-A-D-E 1-0.i am used to the AMC's in California that have huge theaters, stadium seating, clean bathrooms, and have a sort of epic feel to them.this was the complete opposite.no stadium seating, bathrooms you wouldn't even dream of stepping foot in(no automatic paper-towel dispenser!ya, i'm spoiled.).i came here because this seems to be the only AMC theater in Las Vegas and i had a gift card that i got when i was still living in California.i must recommend that you not try the hot dogs.i'm pretty sure i was served a hot dog that had been sitting on the heater for about a week and the bun tasted a few weeks older than that.the one saving grace about this place is that you will always find a good seat because it is fucking empty.i'm the kind of guy that hates going to a packed theater.for that reason alone i might actually come back here(still have 5 bucks left on my gift card)."
3,"Pretty expensive but this is the reality of casino restaurants that are not buffets.  The ambience and backdrop was really very nice and polished. Service was very attentive and was on top of any empty glasses or plates. The prawn toast was the highlight to the night including the complimentary fortune cookie and baileys liquor.  The portions were also well sized leaving my father and I content and full.  \nThe only con was that I felt like everything was an up-sale even without noticing it. For example, my dad got the sweet and sour pork and was asked what kind of rice he wanted with it only to find out on the bill that the rice was not included in the meal (even though it was an extra 2 bucks it still felt a little shady)."
2,"Stingers is my neighborhood bar. I was going there several times a week for awhile until I decided to cut down on my drinking. They make really stiff drinks and always have a \""you Call it\"" special going later at night so ask for it. Their chicken wings are delicious and on point. I get them HOT. My favorite thing is they have karaoke EVERY NIGHT, I think it starts at 10 pm. They do have a karaoke host but my one complaint is you have to pay $1 into a karaoke machine in order to sing a song."
2,"I would like to provide a review of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino.  My last review was on the Aria and I found the Aria an outstanding resort.  My stay at the Aria was July 2012.  The stay at the Bellagio was November 11 to 15, 2012.  I was travelling on business and had a confirmation that needed to be amended.  I tried the 1-877 number on a number of occasions and was never successful getting through.  I arrived at the hotel on the 11th and proceeded to the front desk to check in.  I explained to the checkin lady (Jodi) that I was frustrated with their 1-877 number and she did not care in the least.  She advised that she was going to place me in one of the \""newly renovated\"" rooms.  I obtained the keys and lugged my baggage across the entire casino.  Enter the room on the 16th floor and commenced unpacking.  Part way through I went to enter the bathroom and found the light switch snapped in half.  This meant I could not turn the light on.  I called the front desk and advised them of the issue.  Again I was met with someone that did not care.  She said I would be moved and tried to swap my keys to the new room.  She could not do it so I was told I would have to wait at the room for the bellhop to arrive.  It was at this point that I would have expected a typical Vegas \""upgrade\"" for my troubles.  Instead I was met with person after person that did not care in anyway.  The bellhop arrived and said \""I guess I am here to help you move rooms.  I took the keys to the new room and moved myself....I did not see the need to endure his poor attitude why I moved.  They also ensure the move was convenient by making me move to a room on a separate elevator bank.  This meant returning with bags in tow to the lobby then into another bank of elevator and up to the new room.  Once at the new room is was as average as the other.  Simple room with a view of nothing.   The rest of the trip was as I should have expected....packed Casino with very impersonal service.  While I know both resorts are MGM properties let me clearly state...if you want a great experience with friendly service head to the Aria.  If you want to be treated like crap and be just another customer in the land of packed casinos...take the Bellagio.  Aria is 5 stars and the Bellagio needs to be downgraded to a 3 star at best.  Even the cocktails are better at the Aria..."
4,"Went last night for dinner with a group of 6. The staff was really friendly ans seemed genuinely happy to be there and to see us! The ambiance is great--a little house that is beautifully decorated. The menu is fabulous and we wanted one of everything so we shared a lot of little plates. The meals started with some delicious Buckwheat Biscuits covered in butter. We then had 10 plates including sweetbreads, octopus, caprese, green chile papusa, crispy chicken, roasted potatoes with truffle cheese, beets, peaches, stuffed dates, and a dessert (which I didn't eat since I was full). My favorite dish was the beets. I was most looking forward to the peaches, but I did not enjoy the texture of the crema. I wish Bink's was in my neighborhood because I would love to eat my way through their menu!"
4,"I'm a born and raised New Yorker living in the desert.. I laughed when people said there was a good bagel place in AZ and I was right. Then I was told there was a NY Cheesecake as good as Juniors (Brooklyn, NY).. I laughed again, then I tried it. The owner (Nick) was friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about his cakes as only someone with real passion can be. When he suggested a variety of great sounding flavors I passed and went straight to the \""Classic\"", the real test. denser than Juniors and as delicious as any I have ever had in NYC. Well done. I'll be back!\n\nNow, if he could only craft a decent bagel........"
4,"These guys are fast and friendly. Although it's kinda pricey compared to their other competition sometimes I don't mind spending the money for my car. Demitirus the service guy is great and friendly, also not pushy, but honest as well. Will be coming back. Price paid $68 for full synthetic."
3,"The day after the 100-year-flood we had recently I was watching the feed from a TV news helicopter and saw a parking lot that had turned into a giant swimming pool with a bunch of kids on boogie boards. I wondered where the heck this place was until the camera panned out and I caught a glimpse of the Travelling Monk truck. I didn't have to wait for the camera to pan out and confirm it was near Denny's and Hungry Monk to know where this mall was. This is when I realized the Hungry Monk was a landmark. In the month before this happened, Hungry Monk had become a dining and drinking landmark for me and my friends. Tuesdays and Saturdays are trivia nights and we've attended quite a few of those to play against dozens of other teams with raunchy, silly, risque, and downright funny names. I wouldn't say we've been here enough times to be called regulars but Marcie the bartender knows us and that means we come here often enough. Most of the real regulars hang out at the patio smoking cigs and coffin nails and we've never really ventured out that way. Have seen some bizarre stuff right at closing time at the bar - some guy in his 80's motorboating some woman a few decades younger than he was. Then another time some guy offered his girlfriend to some other guy he was bonding with over drinks. Good times, good times! I've tried most of their food and I usually stick with that massive Hungry Monk Trippel - with locally smoked pulled pork, smoked bacon, and a thick slab of grilled tavern ham and served on thick cut Texas Toast with a side of Freddy G's BBQ sauce. They don't give enough sauce for that though. Also the Monk's Ribs is actually pretty decent for bar food. And their gyros. Funny thing, one of my friends started talking to this guy with tattoos that works at Monk and asked him if he was the bouncer. Nope. Turned out he was the chef. LOL. Place gets pretty packed daily around dinner time but usually clears out before it gets late. These guys also have a TouchTunes jukebox but sometimes they have some crappy radio station turned on so you can't use it. Place closes at midnight most days or at 1 AM weekends. But the closing times are like stop signs in Nogales - mostly just suggestions. I've been there when last call ended up way past the regularly scheduled closing time. Their food is decent but if you're still hungry after they close there's always Denny's next door or Los Favoritos not too far away in the mall."
3,"Excellent as always!  Had the 1/2 off bottle of wine on Sundays, followed by the\nbaked clams and stuffed pork chops.  Also always get a side order of meatballs to split for an appetizer.  The service is terrific and the live music creates the perfect evening!"
2,Lacks atmosphere despite good location & tasty food. Great choice if you're in a hurry.
2,"Its a nice little coffee shop with free wifi.  I'm not a big coffee drinker, so I can't attest to the coffee, it was about the same for me..  I didn't like that they didn't have a lot of pastry choices.  I'm usually not very hard to entice into getting a pastry with my coffee but the 3 times I went there, I just wasn't into the choices they had.  :\\"
3,A head chilling stroll...\nRelaxing without chaos...\nAn urban escape.
1,"I give this place two stars because I reserve one star reviews for absolute shit places. So, I guess you could say this place is just a step above shit. I ordered sweet and sour pork for 17.99 and it was the worst I'd ever had. If you had placed that dish in front of me and asked me to guess how much it cost, I would've guessed maybe 2.99, but no, it was close to 20 bucks. It was advertised as \""crispy pork\"" with a sweet and sour glaze but the dish I was served was soggy, and was clearly not cooked on site. My guess is that it was probably microwaved or perhaps had been sitting out for a while. The waitstaff was neither personable nor warm. Our waiter took his time with refilling our waters, and we had to ask for pretty much all our silverware. Do NOT eat here!! The staff clearly does not care about you, your dining experience, or the fact that you are paying triple the price for the quality of food you're receiving. You're better off eating at Burgr!"
0,"Dear Larry this is david ristick we had my sons 16th birthday day party I love your restaurant your food your service is always five stars !!! we love your whole family we've been friends for years I was there since you open the restaurant Your new GM Maurice made us feel so unwelcome so miserable that it made me feel like I would never want to come there again you know that I drove all away from LA to make my son's birthday party special and  he made us feel so bad that I never want to come back there again if he is working He should be fired!! With all due respect to you your family and your establishment God bless you Larry keep keeping the food coming out good just get rid of this guy ASAP he will ruin your restaurant! He actually said when I told him that I drove from LA  and that I drove 400 miles And he said i \""quote I don't care if you drove 4000 miles! \""What a loser!"
0,"my friends and i stopped by after being recommended to go there and right away we realized the service was horrible. multiple tables were seated after us and they received not only their food but checks before us. in between our dishes the waitress took over 35 minutes and once we ordered came back to tell us 30 mins later that a certain dish was not available. i have 2 friends that are vegetarians and they were not allowed to swap out for other meals. the pepsi we ordered came out flat without carbonation. they also said that the dishes on their menu can change from time to time. I WOULD DEF. TELL YOU NOT TO GO, ESPECIALLY NOT WITH A GROUP. the full meal took close to 2 hrs and we were the first table seated when they opened. horrible!!!!!!!!"
0,I went here twice the 2nd time we came the Waitress was a total bitch and very disrespectfull to my friends sister I've eaten better lebanese food! I've worked in a lebanese Resturant  not to say that the food sucks but the waitress we had was horrible!   and the food there is just ok cause like I said I've had better !
3,"I was lucky enough to head along to one of the \""launch\"" parties of this new bar.\n\nI like the layout and the decor, it's a pretty upmarket place but out of the way enough that I hope the riff raff will be kept out. \n\nI mostly had several glasses of wine to drink and the house red pretty solid all told. I was impressed. I also tried several shots of cocktails including one with popping candy and one black russian style one. We also had a Charlie Chaplain one in a tea cup which was quite quaint! I didn't spot that many good beers so might stick to wine for the moment when I'm there.\n\nFood wise they had herring so they obviously have excellent taste. The burgers looked good and I'll have to come back and have a go at the menu. \n\nThey seemingly have a speakeasy style club downstairs which is only accessable if you know the password - this might make it slightly awesome..... Or just full of dickheads. I guess I'll have to go find out!"
4,Best smoothies in town... Expensive for supplements and vitamins. Friendly staff
0,"They're open 8:30-5:00 Monday - Friday, I know this only because I called and had to interrogate the receptionist.  Nearly asking for the hours was not enough.  \n\nWhen I arrived today at about 11:00 the lights were off, also it's located in a building with a different sign, I'm not actually sure how anyone finds this place.  When I walked in a gentleman doing nothing ignore me.  The receptionist who was with a customer didn't even look at over and no one bothered to turn the lights on.  I lasted about another 30 seconds before leaving.\n\nI won't be back."
0,"Avoid Downtown, but especially AVOID BOYD'S!!! I had my purse snatched INSIDE THE CASINO! Security told me not to call police, that they'd handle everything. They took down my address and other information - and put me on their advertising mail list! \n\nAgain: I got ROBBED there, and instead of calling the police, they put me on their spam list. I even get postcards to remind me that I was robbed and got zero justice!\n\nI went to the police the next day and was told that this was the usual runaround they give people who are robbed in their casinos, so that they don't look bad. I literally called every day for two months trying to get something done.  Nada. \n\nWhatever you do, DO NOT GO TO BOYD'S!!! YOU ARE NOT SAFE THERE!!!!"
2,"Ice cream parlor outside of Caesar's palace.  Usually has a pretty long wait but if you bring a deck of playing cards, Monopoly Deal, or just catch up over cocktails while sitting there, the time passes pretty quickly.  The sundaes are huge and if you like ice cream, this is the place for you.  I wouldn't say the ice cream is hands-down the best, but it is an experience.  They have delicious french fries too!  If you have been to the NYC one, you don't need to go to this one really... unless you're in love with the NYC one. :)"
1,"I went there and had a daily special salmon sashimi, it only has 5 thin pieces and is 10.95$. I also had a soba, where the noodles looked exactly like what I bought from grocery for 3$ a bag, and it's 7.95$. You can't say a sushi restaurant is good, just because champaign doesn't have other good sushi restaurants. I think I will never go there again."
4,"My fianc\u00e9e and I visited Luce on our last evening in Charlotte, a Wednesday night in November.  We arrived at about 6PM without a reservation and were seated immediately.  The staff had no objection to our sitting for half an hour eating olives and sharing a single cocktail to pass some time before we ordered our main meal.\n\nAs many other reviewers have mentioned, the olives are excellent.  So was the negroni.  The ambiance was authentically Italian (and we have been to Italy before): intimate, quiet, and comfortable.  A lot of this is due to the wait staff, who are all at least ethnically Italian, and in some cases rather adorably fresh-off-the-boat.\n\nWhen we finally got around to ordering dinner off of their fall menu, we settled upon a meal with one main course and contorni to share.  My fianc\u00e9e had (A) the spinach papardelle with oxtail rag\u00f9 and I had (B) the risotto ai frutti di mare (a daily special).  To share, (1) cannellini beans with escarole and (2) spinach fried with garlic.  Upon the waitress's recommendation we also ordered one glass of Sangiovese to accompany the entire meal.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e is allergic to most dairy, and when she asked whether the rag\u00f9 had any milk in it, the staff's immediate answer was \""Not that one,\"" which really is the most reassuring answer that one can possibly get.\n\nThe food was, on the whole, marvelous:\n\n(0) The first thing to arrive after we'd ordered was a cold cannellini bean salad with peppers, onions, and basil, served with bread.  Every table got this.  It made a great opener.\n\n(A) The pasta was house-made.  Good, though we have had better - but that was in Italy.  The rag\u00f9 was excellent, with the flavors of tomato, oxtail, wine, and carrot in good balance, and an amazing mouth feel.\n\n(B) My seafood risotto had clams, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and mussels.  The key to seafood is freshness, and what went into my dish was certainly very fresh, with no off-flavors whatsoever.  For my part, I could also taste that they used very high quality cream.  The rice, unfortunately, was a bit grainy.  My guess is that they had one pot of it cooking continuously throughout the night, and that since we arrived early in the night, the risotto actually wasn't quite done.  Nevertheless, the flavors were so good and well-melded that I hardly minded.\n\n(1) The cannellini with escarole was perhaps the one disappointment of the night.  The escarole was blanched first, so it lost its signature bitterness, which we both expected it to contribute to this dish.\n\n(2) The spinach with garlic was 'a good straight line' as the two of us put it.  Is there a cuisine in the world which -doesn't- like spinach stir-fried with garlic?\n\nWe finished with coffee; our waiter commented upon our ordering coffee instead of desserts, \""yeah, that's how we do it in Italy.\""  I had black and she had espresso.  The espresso was very well made, and my coffee definitely benefited from (again) the very good cream.\n\nOur whole meal ran us $85 including tax before tip, and included two drinks, two main courses, two side dishes, and two coffees.  We weren't billed for the tiny plates of olives we had during cocktails, so we left extra tip to match the staff's generosity.\n\nLuce is the most authentic Italian dining experience we have had in the United States."
4,great asada tacos the best
3,"Really good pizza. Everything about it, the ingredients, just the right amount of sauce, the crust. All really good. Not the best I've ever had, but close.\n\nBut...\n\nThe garlic knots were decent, but not good. The salad was good, not great.\n\nThe beer selection was decent."
2,"Went to get the jeep cleaned, in and out in less then 30 minuites.\nClean inside and out"
4,"Great restaurant!  I had the brisket sandwich and loved it.  They bring out fresh cornbread before the meal which is a bonus and small little donuts for after the meal.  The restaurant has a great decor and is a very pleasant atmosphere. If you want some good ol fashion barbecue- try this place out, you won't be let down"
4,We got there an hour early for happy hour. Pretty packed but we found a good spot to stand. Drinks were strong and the prices were reasonable. The dinner show was cool but the dinner  prices are quite high for the how small the portions were. I got the seabass and my wife got the fillet. You defiantly pay for the atmosphere and ambience. Relatively loud music throughout happy hour but once you sit to eat you really only hear in the background. Had fun!
0,"The restaurant seemed nice at first appearance.  Appetizer -chicken potstickers were great.  The bowl size  wasn't too big. It was $9.99 a bowl  (dinner)and make bottom less bowl  ( repeat bowls) was another 4 dollars.  Not  a lot once cooked.  Could have cooked a little longer as broccoli was still completely hard and not even warm.   And the initial bowl is small.  For family of 4, it was expensive  for amount of food.  I was very excited for the restaurant to open up,  but overall  disappointed.  Felt like we rush thru the  entire process and  rushing us out the door.  Won't go again"
1,"The food is decent, but the service is spotty at best.  You may get a good server or not, you never know.  But my complaint is that when you have to pay at the counter, no matter how many customers are lined up, they usually only have one cashier and never seem to call anyone else to help out.  I would shop there after dining, but if the line is short, I'll go ahead and pay just to save the long wait.  Get with it and have the servers take the money, then the only people at the checkout counter are shoppers."
3,"I love buying and cooking with flavored olive oils and vinegars. Olive Gourmet opened up near my house right as I was running low, and I needed to stop in immediately. The owners are very nice and friendly, the selection of olive oils they have on hand is great, and the quality is outstanding. I like that I was able to sample the olive oils and balsamics in the store before buying them, and I frequently stop by just to see what's new. Fantastic store, and I'm glad it opened."
0,"Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares? Try \""You Don't Know From a Nightmare Until You've Sat at Your Own Bar, Gordon Ramsay.\""\n\nWe went to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill this evening to watch the NBA Playoffs. Things started off well enough--we though the fish and chips were a bit greasy and way overpriced, and the french fries tasted burnt, but this was our first time at this restaurant, so we just thought that they were prepared strangely. When someone next to us was served the same dish, we realized that our french fries HAD been burned beyond all recognition.\n\nWe were having a fun time with the bartenders--lots of laughing and jokes. However, one of the bar backs, Antoine, followed my girlfriend when she went to the bathroom. Antoine, is a large, menacing character, and she was not comfortable with his aggressive behavior. When she came back from the bathroom, he came out from the back and handed her his phone number. Later, he said, \""You better not have thrown that number away. You better call me or you can't ever come in here again.\""\n\nAt the end of the evening, one of the bartenders, Keith, put two drinks in front of us that we did not order, and said, \""Try this.\"" We assumed that he wanted us to try a new drink he was working out--we are very familiar with bars, and it wouldn't be the first time that a bartender had asked us to try his drink. I did not care for mine, so I wasn't drinking it. When Antoine came out again, he said, \""What's wrong?\"" I said that I did not like it. Antoine then proceed to PICK UP MY DRINK, DRINK OUT OF THE STRAW, AND PUT THE DRINK BACK IN FRONT OF ME. I sat, mouth agape with incredulity astounded by his presumptuousness, and all I could manage to utter was, \""I don't want that.\"" He then took the drink and said, \""I can't drink this out here, but I will take it in the back. Thanks for the drink!\"" I have never seen anything like this. As I type this, I still cannot fathom that a server (or any other human being) would drink out of a stranger's drink. IN WHAT WORLD IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?!?!? Especially in the context of a server and a customer. My head almost exploded. I supposed that it is fortuitous that I was intimidated by Antoine because that spared everyone from me causing a scene.\n\nI called immediately after leaving the restaurant/bar. When I asked to speak to the manager, the hostess who answered the phone said, \""Sure! What's your name, Hun?\"" I am a doctor and a college professor. \""Hun?\"" What year is this?\n\nWhen I spoke the the manager, there was no greeting on the phone, he just said, \""Zeus.\"" It took a few seconds for me to understand that he was actually stating his name, and I wasn't transferred to the wrong number. When I told Zeus the story, his response was, \""So, I don't understand--are you saying that Antoine threatened you?\"" Hopeless--these people are all so hopeless. Zeus assured me that he would take our last two drinks off of the bill and tell the regional manager about Antoine's behavior. I am not really sure how that is an appropriate response to this horrific situation. \n\nSo, I guess we won't be returning to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill, because my friend has no interest in calling Antoine--she couldn't afford to pay for all of his drinks all night anyway."
2,"I have to say the lure of Oregano's is more the ambiance than the food. On a beautiful evening it's a lot of fun to sit outside with a glass of wine and some good friends and enjoy a meal here. We have friends that come in from Chico every year for the Spring training games and it's kind of a tradition to eat dinner one of the nights at Oregano's. When the toddler was born across the street, my husband walked over that night and got himself some lasagna take-out to come eat with me so now it's also a tradition for us to come here on the toddler's birthday (or thereabouts) to have some dinner and reminisce on that day so that's where we're headed tonight with our brand new three-year-old. \n\nIt's probably me, but none of their pastas really do it for me - I just don't like them heavily sauced and their pizzas are what my husband likes - cracker thin or oily and thick. There's just no in between. I enjoy their salads a lot and the garlic bread and can eat an order of bruschetta on my own. My husband is also a big fan of the roasted garlic chicken lasagna and it seems we always order a pizza cookie for dessert, though we might get one on the house tonight being the toddler's birthday and all. \n\nThe waiters and waitresses are always friendly and helpful. In fact once I guess our order was taking too long to come out (we hadn't even realized) and the manager came out and apologized and gave us some drinks and dessert for free. \n\nThough obviously not a fancy place at all, it's always proven to be a good place to bring out of town guests. The ambiance, food and service make for a unique experience and won't disappoint."
3,Was in Laval for a friend's wedding and stayed at the Sheraton Laval - SPG points!! :)\n\nGreat location - easily accessible to the highways. There is a giant mall right next door across the parking lot. The staff at the hotel were so friendly in helping us figure our hair appointments at a salon at the mall. \n\nThe rooms are nice and modern but not much a view as it is right by the highway and the mall. Room service is reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly and helped us with early check in as well.\n\nNext time in Laval - highly recommended!
0,Awful. The course is a disaster. Temporary greens in the fairways and numerous patches of clover and bare spots. Stay Away!!
4,"This was pretty darn awesome!!!  I went here with my roomie a couple months ago, and this place rocks!!  I was full from the free chips and salsa before I ate my enchilladas, though...  :P  My roomie ordered the Margarita for two people, and when our server brought it to our table, my eyes were so wide from how large the drink was!!!  We couldn't even drink the whole thing, because my roommate had to drive, and I couldn't drink the whole thing myself!  I think it was only $8.00 for that large Margarita, too, unlike the $12.00 you spend for a tiny drink in Old Town Scottsdale (yes, there is a time for Old Town Scottsdale too, though.  :P).  The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean, the staff is friendly, and I left full and happy.  This is definitely a place that you should go and check out!"
0,Dirty. Broken elevators. Smokiest casino and rooms on the strip. Would not stay here again.
3,"Typical pub food, but slightly fancier because of the name Michael Mina?\n\nThe portions here are HUGE!!! I would strongly advise having someone to share your entree with, unless you're so hungry you can eat a whole cow. \n\nThe nachos here do not come on a plate... they give it to you on a whole damn toaster oven sized TRAY that it's baked on! Mmmm... very good but so freaking huge.\n\nFried pickles: they are not sliced pickles; they are whole pickles and come with some magical sauce. Mmmm...\n\n**GREAT CRAFT BEER SELECTION**"
1,"I thought all Walmarts were the same until I had to drop in here a few times.  I've been 2-3 times and I'm going to make a point of going to any of the other Walmart's in town instead (the one on Eastern is definitely better).\n\nI reluctantly add one star because there was one employee who helped my find where something was, and was friendly.  \n\nWanted to try on a pair of sweats and the girl wouldn't let me because the fitting area closed 10 minutes ago (yet the store is 24 hours).  This place is so lame.  Customer service also closes at 10pm so you can't get any help with returns until 8am next day.  SO LAME.\n\nEveryone else I encountered was just miserable and hating life working there it seemed.  Don't go late at night because they could care less about how long people wait to check out.  There will be like 4 checkers and 10+ people in each line.  Cashiers are slow as molasses and just act miserable and like they are waiting to die.  \n\nSo depressing!   Live life and be friendly!"
4,"Great ambiance and music for our Bachelorettes Party. The only downfall, it gets pretty crowded and hard to maneuver through the thick crowd of people."
1,"For a brasserie that purports the name of Thomas Keller from Per Se and French Laundry, it was very disappointing experience.\n\nWe went there for dinner on a Wednesday night. The first course all lived up to the reputation- my husband had the onion soup which was respectable. I had the fall squash soup which was also very good.  What was disappointing were the entrees. My mussels with pomme frites were overly salted. The gnocchi was ok and my husband took the $40 veal special that was just passable.\n\nI do not recommended. Definitely not worth the money."
3,I made an order for delivery one evening and was impressed with this pizza.  I liked the crust and the sauce and the toppings tasted fresh.  I have tried many places for pizza in Tempe and this one is up there with the best ones.
0,Beware!! My mother in law had a cockroach in her tea!!!! Not sure if it was in her cup or in the refill. We noticed it at the end of our meal! We were mortified n they were quite rude about it to boot!! It's a shame because we WERE regulars.
3,"I love the Kabob grill. It may be a litte on the pricey side, but I am a fan of the quality of the food.  While I do like their chicken kabobs, my fav dish here is the vegetarian combo plate.  This typically comes with fresh house-made falafel, fresh house-made hummus, baba ganoush, yalanji, tabbolueh, and spinach pie, etc.  \n\nI love their falafel - it is very tasty.  And the hommus is so fresh.  It is usually served with pickled veggies on the side.  I normally don't love pickled veggies, but they taste great with the hommus & pita.  \n\nI am not a huge fan of yalanji or tabbolueh, so I skip those items altogether & order different side items in their place, such as the lentils with rice (Mijaddara). The mijaddara is flavorful and always good.  (They don't charge any more for the substitutions, which I appreciate.) \n\nI do normally like spinach pie, but theirs is always disappointing so I now avoid ordering it. The problem with their spinach pie is that it has always been pretty dry & tasteless with dark brownish looking spinach and no discernable feta. (Also, their crust isn't as good as the phyllo dough crust that you find at a lot of Greek places). So again, I usually just ask for a different side item or another falafel in place of the spinach pie. (I wonder if they make this item in big batches and freeze it for later because it taste to me like something previously frozen.) \n\nOne of my very favorite things here is their lentil soup served with pita points.  They also have good chicken kabobs, salads, a nice selection of beer/wine/adult bevvies, etc.  \n\nI normally love baklava, but sadly theirs is usually hard and doesn't have a lot of flavor.  (I wonder if this something they get frozen from somewhere else or if they make big batches at a time & then freeze it.)  \n\nThey have great beer specials on Sunday & Monday nights, so those nights are my favorite nights to go.   \n\nAll in all, I really love the majority of their food, as well as the decor & atmosphere of the place.  Looking forward to my next visit!"
4,Great food and the service was pretty quick as well.  We had a party of 10 and everyone enjoyed their meals and drinks.  Can't wait to go there again!!
2,"Surviving the summer heat in Phoenix can be a test of one's resourcefulness. One can retreat to the air-conditioned comfort of one's home, but then one also has to pay the piper when the power bill arrives. Accordingly, Phoenicians tend not to crank the air conditioners down to the frosty extremes familiar to folks in more temperate climates. Besides, it's a \""dry heat\"", right? So you learn how to accommodate a looser, somewhat warmer definition of \""room temperature\"" when you live here.\n\nI discovered that in order to be comfortable in my own home on hot summer nights, I immediately have to strip off my workclothes and promptly don my woobs. Woobs is a word I stole from Kevin Smith (of Clerks fame) for your lounge-around pajama-like comfy cozy clothes. And the more ventilated the woobs the better... so I discovered the appeal of tank tops, pajama shorts, and flip flops.\n\nI needed some more inventory to add to my woobs wardrobe, and had a helluva time locating tank tops (not undershirts) without ridiculous corporate logos or graphics. Some department stores seem to not carry them at all... I guess wife-beating isn't as popular as it once was. It suddenly flashed on me that this would possibly be an item they sold at Old Navy, since most of their clothing is affordable and fairly straightforward, fashion-wise.\n\nI did find men's tank tops in my size at Old Navy, so that was a plus. However, these were a little more of a scoop neck that I really prefer--and a mite snug for someone of my rotundity. Out of sheer desperation to add more pairs to the rotation, I bought two shirts (whose gonna see me in my PJs anyhow?). Unfortunately, after washing, these shirts got even tighter and appear even more low cut than when I tried them on the store. Now when I try them on, I see an oafish Freddy Mercury wannabe looking back at me (hairy chest resplendent!). Only when my looser, less flamboyant sleeveless shirts are in the wash do I now even dare to wear my Old Navy purchases. Clothing shopping lesson learned.\n\nNonetheless, I have managed to find some other decent bargains at this Old Navy store. I snagged a western shirt for $10.50 and a decent hoodie for $12 recently. I'm just gonna steer clear of the \""Bears Shop Here\"" aisle."
4,The best! Everyone was right about the customer service too! I ordered mochi and the guy at the counter was really helpful with educating me on the different products.
2,"We decided to try this place after a friend recommended it.  I was totally dead the night we went, it was a Monday and football was on.  There were only 2 other guys at the bar with us, no diners in the restaurant.  Service was great of course being the only ones there, and the servers were friendly.  They had free shots when a touchdown was scored.  We ordered some small plates, Jalapeno Puffs, Dragon Balls, Crab Wontons, which were all delicious. Then we ordered the $18 Large Plate, Steak Frities, VERY DISAPPOINTED.  One side of the steak was well done, and the other side was totally rare, inedible for us.  The fries weren't totally done either, some of them were still hard.  That was a total bummer, because we really liked everything else. We left it on the plate and ordered the Sorbet, u can't screw that up.  \nAll in all, I think it's a nice little place, nice atmosphere.  We'll probably go back, but it won't be a regular place to go."
2,"The location of this Starbuck's is good for me. It is off the beaten track so it rarely is full, I can browse the internet while I wait for whomever I am meeting (that's my primary purpose for going to this location) and I never have had any issues with the coffee, but I don't do fancy, just straight up coffee for me."
2,"What?!? I can't customize my burger here? I think I'm spoiled after going to Burger Bar and being able to build my burger exactly how I want it. But, despite having to \""settle\"" for one of their burgers straight off the menu I do have to say that their food is pretty good. \n\nAsian Banh Mi burger - it's a pork and shrimp burger. I was expecting a pork patty w/ shrimp on top, but instead they put pieces of shrimp in the ground pork to form the patty. With the cucumbers and sriracha mayo it's a tasty burger.\n\nShaft's Blue burger - the blue cheese is in the beef patty. Very tender and juicy. The caramelized onions and mushrooms on top were great.\n\nOnion rings - large slices of onions that are fried perfectly. These onion rings are definitely better than the ones at Burger Bar.\n\nKid's grilled cheese - it's a standard grilled cheese sandwich. My kid wasn't feeling it but loved his fries.\n\nChocolate milkshake - delicious, but overpriced for $8. I should have picked up 3 shakes from In-N-Out on the way home instead.\n\nThe bill came out to be over $50. Yeah, the food was good but it's definitely overpriced."
2,"Wie auch in ECE geschrieben bin ich kein Starbucksfan.. aber auch hier ist die Location sch\u00f6n gelegen, mitten in der Fu\u00dfg\u00e4ngerzone. Fr\u00fcher war hier glaube ich mal der Tschiboladen????  da war ich dann mal gerne zum K\u00e4ffchen und Leute gucken. Seit es den Starbucks hier gibt war ich nicht mehr dort, ist halt Geschmackssache und eben nicht meiner. Ansonsten freu ich mich mit den Fans dieses Getr\u00e4nks"
3,"HATE  Nothing.\n\nDISLIKE  Our first, traditionally unfriendly first server. Duck tasted a little gamey. The dingy bathroom.\n\nLIKE  The seafood crispy noodles. The preserved tofu Chinese spinach. The roast pork.\n\nLOVE  Our main server Tammy who was upbeat and had great suggestions. The reasonable pricing."
1,"February 2, 2013: Absolutely terrible. I hate giving low marks, especially to French restaurants.\n\nMy friend works marketing for UFC and offered us some choice seats. We arrived at the beginning during the minor fights, so we decided to have a few cocktails and a small meal. I chose Fleur because I saw they had a decent happy hour menu and lots of bar seating. \n\nOnce we checked in, I asked the hostess if bar seating was available and she said yes. Mind you the bar was literally 2 yards away from them. Once we turned we saw there were absolutely no seats--let alone standing room. \n\nWe wandered back to them and the hostess turned her back to go attend something instead of asking what was wrong or what we needed. We finally were sat after waiting an additional 10 minutes to be sat at one of the 10 tables that were available in the patio area. \n\n15 minutes later who we thought was our waiter was zooming pass us. An additional 15 minutes later---no waitress, but a nice busboy took our drink orders. 20 minutes later no drinks or waitress. I finally caved and called for the manager who apologized and used the excuse, \""She is serving Absinthe right now\"". I rationalized that she did not start serving said Absinthe until 30 minutes after we were seated. The couple behind us had not been attended to as well. \n\nThe waitress finally came over and gave us our drinks without saying her name or greeting us. My dirty martini was watered down. Clearly it had been left on the counter as the little ice flecks had completely melted. Again, no waitress in sight to ask for a fresh one. Eventually called the manager over because it was getting ridiculous and we hadn't even seen our food yet. He tried to reason that the martini was not watered down. After examining the glass he saw the amount of condensation was identical to that of a \""dead\"" drink. My replacement was much better.\n\nNow to the food...We ordered the oysters and tacos. The actual food from the appetizers combined was the size of 1 smart phone. The worst part is that the taco tasted like shelf bought tacos, while the oysters were tasteless.\n\nThe manager asked how everything was and we were upfront, but polite about the fact that it was far below par. He half apologized and gave us this annoyed look. I was so disappointed in this restaurant. Among my worst 10 dining experiences. That is saying something because one of the things on the list was going to Bertrands and finding GLASS in my drink."
0,"I'm surprised to see all the great reviews for this place - I think its terrible in many ways...\n\nI work across the street and my coworkers and I often head over to the AZ center for Happy Hour. We've tried 1130 a few times and each time leave disappointed. This place tries to be more than it is and charges a pretty penny for its mediocre food and horrible service. I've been in there when there are only 2 other tables filled in the entire place and not seen my waiter for 20 minutes. My glass empty and my group ready for another round.\n\nOn our last trip, we got there 10 minutes before they started happy hour - they wouldn't serve us at happy hour prices, so we said come back in 10 minutes then. Most places I've been will gladly serve you and just wait to punch in the order in a few minutes, but 1130 was not interested in do this. So, after 10 minutes, no waiter. 25 minutes, no waiter. Some goofy dude came out after a while and told us our waiter was getting dressed and would be right out.... Another 10 minutes later, she made her way out and we finally got our order in!!\n\nWhen she brought our beers ( 2 8th Streets, 2 Blue Moons) she handed us the glasses - who does that? Every place I've ever been sits them on the table rather than awkwardly hand them to you risking spilling it all over you... Whats worse is the pint glasses weren't even full!! They looked as though our late dressing waitress had taken a fat gulp out of them on her way to our table!!\n\nWe also ordered some Calamari, luckily it was happy hour so it was 1/2 way affordable, but it was heavy on the garnish and few on the calamaris. There were 4 of us and you know how it is when you share an ap, nobody wants to be the one to finish it - well, our waitress finally made her way back to our table (after I had an empty glass for over 10 minutes) and without asking took the plate of calamari! For RUDE! Paws off lady, ask first before grabbing at our food. \n\nOverall, this place is trying to be way more than it actually is. Its way overpriced for what you get. The service is horrendous - and I say that only after giving it several tries. It might be an okay place to grab a drink (it is cozy afterall) but even at $3.25 happy hour pints, it ain't cheap. I just don't see it lasting long at that location."
0,Just an update to my previous review.  Here's a suggestion to the management:  Why are you charging someone twice for utilities when they move out?  When someone gives their sixty day notice just combine the charges for those final two months in just one bill instead of two separate billing statements.
1,"Sorry to say this is not a restaurant I would return to. We eat Indian on  are regular basis, and I would say the food is average, maybe a bit above, however the main issue was the service.\n\nOur waiter was extremely friendly, however we were there on a Friday night, and there was not a crowd, it was a best 20% full.  First, they had a full bar, but they were NOT serving drinks.  Apparently they sent the bartender out on a delivery, and no one else could mix drinks.  Why they did this on a Friday night is totally beyond me.\n\nWe also had issues with the waiter, while friendly, both waiters I noticed spent the majority of the night on the phone.  Not taking orders, just talking.  We struggled to get their attention when we needed to, and several things were missed on our order.\n\nFood was extremely reasonable, however the service issues were simply too much for us to overcome, and thus we will not go back."
4,"This is by far my favorite place for Italian food in the Queen City. I was born in Brooklyn, NY, and every time my mother visits, she insists we go to Portofino's at least once. The service is fantastic and the food is authentic Italian (again, that's coming from the mouth of a New Yorker!). The Chicken Parm is my go-to dish -- my ultimate comfort food. Overall, I'd highly recommend this spot if you're in need of good food. Period."
2,"I was expecting this place to be more like Create where we walked up to the counter to make our selection, but I was surprised that it was a sit down restaurant. The burgers are great and definitely better than Create. However, that quality does cost. This is why they lost a star. I don't mind paying for good, quality food, but there's other burger places I prefer over Grind (e.g. Bachi Burger, Slidin Thru, Smashburger).\n\nI also got a side of Onion Strings and I'm so glad I got it to share with the rest of my table. Because it was HUGE. It was piled up on a entree sized plate.\n\nIt's a good restaurant but my taste buds prefer a Banh Mi Burger over the ones I can find at Grind."
0,Went here for dinner last night. We received a gift card as a wedding present and we're very excited to have dinner here. Our waitress was incredible she was nothing short of lovely smart and very consistent with making any of our needs happen. We gave her a $10 tip and suggested to her to find a new job somewhere else for her talents can be appreciated. The food however was absolutely disgusting I ordered the triple bacon burger which I would assume would have triple the bacon and had two tiny slices of bacon on top. I I was hoping it at least would taste good. It did not the Baconator from Wendy's has more bacon than this did and the taste is much better. Now for $12 for a burger I would expect more. My partner had the steak and shrimp parmesan he looked nauseous as he ate it. We both just got through our meals and hoped we could just finish. I'm sorry we both agreed we would never go back to Applebees again. We told our waitress over the huge concern over our food however I know there's nothing she could do about it. She did her job and provided exceptional service Applebees did not do their job by providing absolutely terrible food for their clients to eat never ever ever ever will go back.
3,"The boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday morning hung over from Four Lokos. \n\nThe food was fucking great and I don't even like breakfast food.  I got this egg and jalapeno burrito thing with this sort of runny but generally pretty tasty salsa and I wanted to shower in the burrito filling.  I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.  \n\nIt was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?)\n\nI'm deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.  The boyfriend and I, being young dirty Mesa kids still slightly intoxicated off Four Lokos, felt mildly out of place in this setting and were a little over whelmed by the amount of yuppie whiteness.\n\nNonetheless, the food was worth the trip and the cozy patio on a Sunday morning was a nice change from, you know, Cheerios on the futon while watching exercise equipment infomercials."
1,"I have to be honest, my experience there yesterday was less then desirable.  I was irritated by the way the hostess handled herself.  She is just a nasty individual with zero customer service and the manager was exactly the same.  My friends and I go often and for these 2 women to be nasty to my group is unacceptable!  \n\nAfter the rude and obnoxious behavior from these 2 ladies, I am not sure if we will be heading back to the Vig anytime soon.  Also, from other patrons of the Vig yesterday, they also experienced the same behavior from the 2.\n\nMy recomendation to the Vig.....Find yourself a new hostess and Manager."
1,"I was so excited to try this restaurant that our close friends that our real foodies had been telling us about for quite some time. We had a birthday to celebrate so it was the perfect reason to get dressed up and head to the Cosmo. The four of us were seated and I noticed immediately how loud it was, almost to where we couldn't have a conversation. There were lots of kids there as well so it isn't a place for a romantic date by any means. The wine list came on an IPAD which was cool until I saw that they only had Spanish wines by the glass. I had never heard of any of the them and had a hard time choosing. The waiter was friendly enough to suggest one based on what I like. When it came I did not like it at all. He brought me another to try and when I told him I thought it was corked he said it just had \""barnyard\"" notes to it. Who the heck wants to drink a wine that smells like a barn? We ordered a meat sampler plates, some olives, ham croquettes, shrimp with lemon aioli and oilive salt. Everything was good, not amazing and the portions were so small even for tapas that we either each got one bite or had to cut something in half. We didn't even feel like we'd eaten anything after the first seven plates that I proceeded to quickly order 7 more. The mussels stood out but the paella was so bland and crunchy (underdone) that we had to send it back. We decided to leave before dessert and headed next door to Blue RIbbon Sushi because we know they have the best ginger bread pudding in the world. I don;t think this place lives up to Firefly which is just ok and no where near as delicious as Julian Serrano in Aria."
0,"We got turned away at the door because they only accept EXACT CASH for a ride...they literally won't even give you change...AND they give you attitude about it because how dare someone ask for change?  Even public buses will give you change but they won't. To top it off, when we were digging through our purses trying to find cash, an employee told us to move because we were in the way.\n\nAND we wasted money on non-refundable parking just to leave 2 minutes later. That's probably how they make their money because how do they make any when they turn customers away? \n\nAlso the only bathroom is a Mr. John port-a-potty. In the end we just drove up the hill ourselves....at least we saved those $15."
2,Rooms are clean. Bathrooms are decent. Casinos are what you would expect. \n\nNothing out of the ordinary.\n\nYou have to pay extra to work out in their fitness room. I hate that. I just want to run for two hours and I have to pay more than $10 for that?
2,"So just like another comment that rated this place low, I also did not get a tattoo at this shop because their way of business is ridiculous.\n\nI called and asked for a reservation and the lady told me I had to put $150 deposit! Just for a reservation! I told her that my tattoo is a simple 5 character word tattoo, 1\"" tall and 3-5\"" wide and she said it didn't matter. And that their tats start at $150. \n\nI might have heard the last part wrong, but I shouldn't have to cough up $150 for a deposit for easily a $60-80 tattoo. \n\nIt's a shame, because I was really excited to go here based on the reviews."
2,"Haji Baba is good. Not exceptional, but good. I don't understand all the fuss about this place, kind of like Fez where everyone raves about it and I just don't get it, so maybe it is me. \n\nThere is no atmosphere to speak of, what so ever, not that its a bad thing. The place is sectioned off into two portions, one a dining area, and one a grocery store. We were seated at one of the tables in the grocery store, like.... IN the grocery store. No complaints here, I find something oddly comforting about eating in a place like this.\n\nThe food was good, hummus though was very good. We had a nice array of salads, gyros, shwarmas, hummus, spanikopita, baklava, etc. All sorts of shit was at the table, and it was all good, but none of it made me go oh man this is the best I've ever had. \n\nI'd return for two reasons, one is the price. Dinner for 4 with more than we could eat was less than $30. reason two is the great service. We didn't more than 5 minutes for ANYthing. They are quick here, and very accommodating."
3,"By far the best Italian in Lawrenceville!  Our service was fabulous, Ashley was attentive, truly knew and obviously enjoyed the menu. I ordered a linguini with shrimp, scallions and chives, it was very good, I did have to lightly salt it.  My husband ordered chicken casalinga, a nice sized portion and very good - I did salt his lightly also.  We will go back!"
0,"I, honestly, will NEVER go back to this place (& that's sad because I did want to try the Samoan specialty drink there, which, I don't know why they would serve that there being that everyone, besides the Asian Waitress, was white). IDK \n\nBut I really hate when I leave a place feeling used & played. Not only with my monetary but with my dignity & time. My whole experience there was inappropriate, uncomfortable, loud, obnoxious, tense & with some nasty food to top it all off. \n \nWe had the shrimp stir fry that had no enhanced flavor, oiling & watery veggies (about 4 lil' carrots & broccoli) that was as bland as the cook (white beach boy looking guy) who was sitting at the bar \""celebrating\"" his 33rd birthday with the dishwasher/bartender that everybody is mentioning on here. (He is ridiculous and must be a relative to the owner, Jayson, because if he is not, I really don't know how he is employed in this country with high unemployment rate).  \n\nWhen we walked in we were greeted by the submissive Asian Lady I feel sorry for to have to be there. (I really wanted to ask her where in the world is her father or some normal non assimilated Asian Male figure at. Because I am POSITIVE that his presents would make a huge difference there). \n\nThe restaurant is too small to be loud. Yelling and cursing like a sports bar. The waitress said it was because apparently \""the game was on\"" but according to other reviews here that was as BS as the place. \n\nThe dishwasher/bartender (guess name is Robbie?) was drinking a corona (I guess OK in the state of AZ to drink on the job) but he was also talking about hispanic people and something about skin color with a customer who was talking about the fortune cookie is telling him to learn chinese? (He was passive. yeah, you know what I mean by that. He was as passive as the \""Bartender\""...eating & in a \""ethnic\"" establishment loving the ethnic food but taking reckless \""aims\"" towards it's people.)\n\nWe were going to dine in but after about 10 minutes in this sports bar we decided to get our food to go. \n\nWhen we were walking out (just like the other yelper said) weirdo creepo goes, \""have a good night ladies\"" being a straight prick because I know that he knows we left because of him (He was even in my conversation from across the room giving his two thoughts?!).\n\nDon't support this place unless you are like them and like to eat our food but don't like taking cheap shots to the people who this food originates to. \n\nThey call this place \""Americanize Chinese\"" or use these terms \""Americanize or Modern twist\"" but this isn't much of a twist its really a reckless combination that SHOULD NOT be mixed! Bring back original everything, including an Asian or Mexican who culture is this FOOD!"
2,"I feel like Top's has been getting angrier and more bitter over time.  I called on Fourth of July just to see if they were open and they guy on the other line told me, \""Yeah and we're a madhouse.  Each minute I spend on the phone with you is another body out the door,\"" and hung up on me.\n\nI wanted to call back and tell him, \""You know, the amount of time that it took you to say that, you probably lost two bodies out there door.  You could have just said, 'Yes we are!' and that would have sufficed.  Instead, you had to be snarky so I'm calling you back specifically to waste your time.\""\n\nInstead, I'm just going to Yelp about it.\n\nOn multiple occasions coming back over the past few months, I feel like I'm tip-toeing through the house when someone's mad at me.  I don't get it.  There's a serious vibe of negativity going on.  Specifically, the guy who acted like a fuckface over the phone has been snarky and bitchy a few times to me.  \n\nOh, and refrigerate your fucking beer.  I'm tired of having to pop my shit in the freezer for 45 minutes cause the beer or champagne I buy is piss warm."
2,There was a bug in my yogurt!! Theh took a look at it and sure enough there was a little critter. They were nice enough to let me get a new one after that. Beware of the fruits!
1,Tasted the MTL a table menu and was very disappointed. Expected more from the main dish (carrots and porc) -- the burger was not special either \nAlthough the service and ambience are friendly and cosy the food is under-par
1,"Yes I've experienced better Chipotles. This location is always busy so when we order lunch for the office we fill out the fax sheet. Kinda hard to screw that up but somehow they did. My co-worker crossed out both squares for the beans, which clearly means NO BEANS. Well she got both black and pinto beans. She also complained that she didnt get enough meat. \n\nMy order wasnt screwed up but about halfway through my bowl I kept asking myself  \""where the f is the meat.\"" After digging some more there was still barely any meat. \n\nWe have eaten at that location several times and although the food is always good, they often times manage to screw something up. Never big screw ups but something is always off. \n\nNo complains about the Alma School and Queen Creek location.\n\nPluses: Nice location, liquor license!"
4,"Fantastic fast food. The fries are freshly sliced when you order them and not too salty.  But it's the secret menu burgers that make it so hard to live so far from an In-N-Out Burger.  Order a Double Double, Animal style and you'll understand why these are my favorite fast food burgers.  I miss In-N-Out with a passion."
0,"My daughter and I came here looking for furniture and items for her new apartment and we got a little sidetracked at the exercise equipment department. She'd been considering buying a treadmill, too, so she chose one to try out and found that it was \""locked\"". A salesman wandered by and asked if she was interested in buying - she said, possibly so, so he unlocked the treadmill. After trying it and thanking him, he then told her to \""come back when she was ready to buy\"", in an \""I'm not taking you seriously\"" kind of manner. Not once was he the least bit friendly or did he even crack a smile. That is the last time we will visit that particular store. Poor customer service or was he just having a bad day (although the store had just opened and there was no one else around!)? Never again!"
4,"I'm a huge fan of Padre's! What food I've tried (I mainly just order tacos or their pork sliders usually) is delicious, the bartenders are awesome, and the owners are always friendly!\n\nOne of my favorite things to do: Order two tacos and half a bowl of guacamole with chips and salsa."
2,Steak was good. Chicken was chewy. Service was great. Price not bad. I've had much better for the price.
0,"The sushi was good, the service absolutely sucked!  2 of us did all you can eat.  Ordered two rolls and two nigiri, first round took 20 minutes plus to get to us.  2nd round took even longer!  Will not return."
4,"I was absolutely devastated when the shop on Gorgie Rd closed for Jacob to open up at Haymarket. All the baking is still done from Gorgie, but no more popping down the street to grab goodies when I have visitors.\n\nI love the slogan that Jacob's has - 'we bake what we want' and its true. Seasonal ingredients are often used so if it's plum's in season and a local customer has donated excess plums from their orchard, then plums will feature in different cakes over the following few days. \n\nAlthough I am gluten free, my friends and family aren't and they would never forgive me if I tried to feed them GF bread for brekkie. My fall back used to be Jacob's. Fresh croissants and artisan breads, baked fresh on the premises and sometimes I'd leave the shop with my little bag of warm, fresh out of the oven delights, ready to reclaim my role as the hostess with the mostess.\n\nI don't get to visit as often as I would like but I do try and pop up for fresh croissants, breads and gorgeous sweet pastries for family and friends. My parents love the Danish Pastries in particular (the plum ones being a favourite) but often, I'll grab a selection of breads, quiches, and cakes and they go down a storm.\n\nThere is now a cafe at Haymarket, with filled sandwiches, quiches, etc available and it is a bright and airy space. Lots of room for moving about with space between tables which is great. Again, prices are really reasonable and it is worth a visit :-)"
4,"Captain Bills.. aka \""sub shop\"" to some.  (disclaimer- I grew up right down the street, and therefore am somewhat biased)\n\nI love this place.  I know any food/sandwich snobby will likely berate this place.  To the uninitiated, warning sirens might be blaring in the back of your head from the moment you pull in to the parking lot.  From the sketchy run down strip malls, to the punk teenage kids smoking and joking on the patio, to the tasteless yet absolutely hilarious bumper stickers covering nearly every inch of the interior.  \nManning the register will always be some pretty teenage girl with too tight shirt and impossibly short shorts, as the long time owner (Bill?) seems to have a not-well-hidden, creepy old perverted man vibe to him.  Now that I think about it, in the nearly 25 yrs that I have been going to this place, I dont think I have ever seen a male employee.\nNow to the food.  This is not a gourmet sandwich shop.  However the sandwiches are pretty good.  And as for value??  Seriously I dont think you can beat it.  As recently as 10 years ago you could get the Mini sub combo for 99cents which consisted of a 5 inch sub and a small drink, or you could pay $1.99 and double up to the 10 inch sub and medium drink.  Due to inflation, this may cost a whopping $2.60 now.\nRegarding the sub, its pretty good.  The bread is fresh and chewy, with shredded lettuce, tomatoes,onions and standard sub meat, but the key component is this italian dressing that is amazing.  Its secret ingredient must be crack because this stuff is addictive. Douse my sub in it and im happy.  Spill it on to my shoe and I would probably try to eat that as well.  And the drinks are made with the excellent crushed ice chips that i love.  This stuff is almost snow cone grade ice.  Yum Yum.\nAs for the rest of the menu?  Yes there is more, but why bother.  I've never had a need or desire to order anything other than the Double mini combo.  \nSo if you live or work in the neighborhood, I recommend stopping by and getting the best lunch you will ever find for less than $3.00."
1,"I came not because I'm a Jimmy Buffett fan but because I was looking for some adult beverages on the Strip and the menu looked good too. My mother and I arrived on a Saturday night around 8 and waited somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes for a table, which is really not bad considering it was Saturday. I did not know this place was so huge, there are 3 floors! There is also a gift shop that we strolled through while waiting for our table, as well as talked to an employee there; they have men walking around on stilts, dressed in sailor costumes (think Popeye). That was entertaining enough. The huge margarita tubs behind the bar are cool to look at.\n\nAnyway there is not too much to say. Our waiter was prompt despite a packed house, our food and drinks were good, the atmosphere is casual and I enjoyed the tv's everywhere playing the music video for whatever song happened to be playing on their playlist. It may be outdated but I still like watching music videos. I feel for the prices we should have gotten more food though; everything was good but the quantity did not match the prices. For the record we had a shrimp cocktail (Peel N Eat Shrimp), Coconut Shrimp, and the BBQ Pork Sandwich. No complaints about our food otherwise. I had a margarita which was good and I think my mom had a beer. It IS the Strip and we had fun so it's a give and take. Next time I will probably sit at the bar exclusively for drinks and maybe some appetizers. I'm not running back to Margaritaville but will be there again sometime.\n\nI was really between 2 and 3 stars, and although the food was good it really can be found elsewhere, so that bumped it down to a 2 for me."
1,"Poundstretcher reminds me of shopping in the mid 90s with my mum - I used to drag her around What Every's and in here against her will to search for cheap toys and CD's. My cheapskate aunt was also all over the bargains Poundstretcher had to offer, and we would consequently receive some rather fetching, oversized pyjamas out of here for Christmas each year.\n\nNostalgia over - nowadays What Everyone Wants has disappeared, and I don't see as many Poundstretchers, either. But this one in the slightly run down South Bridge still stands. Amidst its bargain store friends, it sells all kind of everything - from outdoor BBQ sets to gardening equipment.\n\nPoundstretcher can be alright but sadly this one is on the shabby side. Although it's huge and spans over two floors, it's not very neat or orderly at all. In short, it's a shambles. So while Poundstrecher can come up trumps with the bargains, this one is a chore to raid around since stock is bundled erratically all over the shop. Other local bargain stores are a better bet, since they seem to be better organised."
2,Was trying to schedule an appointment. They kept me on hold forever. I just hung up and went somewhere else. I do love polished but they are not very convenient for my hectic schedule.
3,"Turned the car in for a quick oil change and decided to kill the time watching a movie! The ticket line was quick and easy to navigate. The cashier was friendly and we went from being in line to ticket in hand in no time.\n\nOnce inside the lobby was clean and well-kept. The ticket taker was nice and pointed us in the direction of the theater. We opted to pass on food since we had just eaten, so can't speak to the snack bar area, other than it looked well organized from afar.\n\nTheater itself was in good condition and clean. The seats were in good shape, and although we were in a smaller auditorium, the screen was easy to see the movie on without feeling like you were in an uncomfortable position for viewing.\n\nOverall: A\nGood movie watching experience!"
3,"This is a local favorite of mine that I visited for lunch.  I'd only ever had dinner there. \n\nFood was good, waiter was great, atmosphere was clean and warm and sort of. . . upscale casual.  My wife wanted someplace \""quaint\"" to eat, but after visiting several quaint options. . . defaulted to an old standby.\n\nOld standby is a slap in the face.  We love Sonoma.  So we visit it more than most other nice restaurants.  \n\nAnyway, soft music playing in the background, a cold sauvignon blanc to compliment my vietnamese pork po-boy. . . it was a very nice lunch."
3,"The grits were ON POINT. I got the fried chicken and waffle. Super hot fire. Had to dock a point 'cause the lady up front barely understood English, so it literally took like 20 minutes just to order my food. But other than that, the food was hella good. I would definitely be back."
4,"It IS in the Sante Fe Hotel, however, it feels like you're in a sexy restaurant on the strip.  The atmosphere is perfect for those with a sophisticated palate, but lacks the loud music, and obnoxious attitudes... If I lived in North Las Vegas, I would love having this place close by without having to drive into town.\n\nNow onto the drinks.  Pretty great wine list with everything from Stags Leap to Cakebread at prices you would expect to pay at a steak house. Had martini's at a prior visit that were excellent.\n\nLOVE the lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and filet mignon.  The 12 oz was enough to split with a girlfriend!\n\nYou can make it work on $50-$75 per person plus tip depending on how hungry you are."
1,"I've been going to Pressley Park since forever and it's always been a dependable \""meat+three\"" place to go. Last week I was in the area and stopped in for lunch. I happened to be in a hamburger mode so I ordered the double cheeseburger. I will have to say that cheeseburger was one of the worst cheeseburgers I've had. Two pieces of identical slabs of hamburger that looked like they had just gone from the freezer to the bun, bypassing the flattop altogether. Cheese squares then flopped on and hardly melted. All on a sort of dry bun. It just wasn't what I was expecting or what should have been served.\nYes, I'll go back some day but will probably stick with the veggie plate."
3,"Staff was very helpful, pool area was clean and up to date. Rooms were clean and up to date.\n\nWould stay here again."
4,"I have, to date, not been able to find a better bean and cheese burro than Lulu's. I've been going here since I was a little girl and I swear that good 'ol burro get's better every time. I've also had their shredded beef tacos, chimis, enchiladas, and there chips and salsa is tasty. I've had their wonderful horchata and they have the best ice ever!! Is that weird...? If you go you'll know. It's like Sonic ice. It's run by a family and I see the same workers in there every time. I love getting to know them through the years, such a nice family. I do think the taco's are average, good, but average. But that burro... Bean's, cheese, x-tra cheese, and sour cream. Pour the salsa over the top and add some limes. Yummm!!!! I even moved to Los Angeles (mexican food?) and yeah right, I craved this place weekly. I love you Lulu's..."
4,"Hands down one of the best meals I have had all year! The kale salad and filet oscar style were simply amazing, the asparagus was not my fav but otherwise what an amazing dish. You pretty much cannot go wrong with any of the sides. If on the rare chance you have room left over, the funnel cake dessert should not be missed. At the end of the meal it took quite a while for the server to deliver the check, this happened at 3 separate restaurants during my stay in Vegas so I've accepted it as a Vegas thing. If you don't mind spending $$$$ on din or are fortunate to be here on business (like I was) then I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant."
0,"This shop failed to accurately diagnose a cracked head gasket that is now requiring a complete engine block replacement. I first brought my car to them in mid August 2011, and I've been bringing it in periodically since then, with symptoms of disappearing coolant, overheating, intermittent starting issues, all of which point to head gasket issues. They failed to diagnose this and they had several opportunities to do so! Never again will I bring a vehicle to this shop.  If you want a good Ted Wiens shop, go to the one on Blue Diamond and Arville."
2,"Just stopped in for first visit.  I was prepared for a long wait in line.  I got there at 5:24pm and left with my take out order at 5:45pm.   The delay wasn't in the ordering line but during the checkout.  I'll start from beginning. \nArrived and there were just two couples ahead of me, the guys taking the entree portion of the order were quick.   It's an assembly line style counter like Chipotle and similar.  The meat guys take your order and if ordering by the pound they weigh it down the the gram .  Scoot along in line to the people putting together your side dishes etc.  You talk to them thru a wall tipped with glass/sneeze guard.  I'm a lil short so I had to kinda holler from tiptoes.  All went well however they were out of my first choice of spicy cheddar sausage and onion tangles.   \n\nMy whole visit seemed pretty easy  till a lil snafu in checkout .  The clerk didn't ring up my whole order together (the assembly line scoots your order down to the cashier) processed payment for half the order then had trouble trying to refund me and redo the transaction . The manager(?) had to swipe his access card easily 10-12 times during the whole process , almost each time having to pull card from his wallet.  I suggested a retractable badge clip for the future .  Anyway finally all done and out I go.  Got some extra sauces and my complimentary soft-serve cone and headed home . \n\nMy meal was satisfying except for the bacon green beans (my substitute for sold out onion tangles). They are pale mushy and underseasoned.  The Mac and cheese however was good! Hot and cheesy.  My meal was today's special, The Westerner.  A pulled pork/polish sausage sandwich with cheese onions an pickles. I really liked it. \n\nI'll definitely be back, maybe try ordering online for quicker pick up."
3,"I enjoyed the show. Yes, it could be better but I liked it. It made me want to go see Cirque du Soleil O. Heard that one is wonderful."
4,"I love this place!  You never know what your going to find!  They have all kinds of things, that are usually slavaged from a home or business.   Kitchen cabinets, tables, mantels, windows, doors, tons of doors!   If your some one who likes to fix old things or make new things out of old stuff, you must go here!  I picked up an old dresser today for $10 its needs the drawer fixed and to be refinished, but when its done its going to look beautiful!  They have old appliances , bathroom sinks and toilets, lighting fixtures, wood, paint, counter tops, flooring materials, some tile, etc., etc.!"
3,"When you get into this hotel, check in on Facebook. A coupon will pop up for a Buy one, get one free drink in any Paris hotel bar. Go to the rewards counter, show the screen and get the voucher. I did this two days in a row and went to the bar next to the sports book. The bartender said that if I used the video poker machines, he could keep giving me drinks as well. \n\nI haven't stayed here but will consider it for my next trip. The inside is lovely and the location is fantastic."
0,"There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \""rewards\"" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.  That is why they get the one star I'm offering them."
0,"hit the Palace last week with the roomie - it's 7 pm - we're the only customers.  ok, it's the holidays, the economy sucks, blah blah blah.\n\nAmazingly, after being seated, it takes 3 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  After ordering a water and soda, the server rolls her eyes - i sense it was because we didn't order more.  Order the kabob combo,  geez i don't even remember what else, the delay in taking the order, the delay in getting the food, i really can't remember what the food was like - fuck this place !"
0,Not clean. Poor service. Attitudes. Not helpful. Insensitive. Rude. \n\nWACK
3,"Although I proclaim Vietnamese food is one of my all time favorites, if not the favorite, I can never get myself to go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Growing up with a chef for a dad, and a mom that can rival him in this cuisine, makes me never want to pay for something that they can cook better. Anytime pho is mentioned, I find eight friends lining up at the front door.\n\nFinally giving in and taking the advice of various friends, I came to this converted 50's diner. When you walk in, you are greeted by the conflicting smell of Vietnamese food and the shell of the western world. Not much has changed in aesthetics besides the few scattered Asian trinkets and framed artwork.\n\nThe food is a little pricier than you will find in Chinatown, but I do not have to drink a gallon of water to subdue the side effects of MSG overload. I am not saying that they don't use any, it just isn't as noticeable. My group had ordered spring rolls. They were on the small side, but the flavors were all there. I swear I tasted mint in there and that is an ingredient that some places neglect to include and it is a shame. I had ordered the lotus salad. This was exactly what I was craving. Light, flavorful, cool and not greasy. The perfect meal for the summer months. The salad consists of lotus stems, jicama, mint, onions, shrimp, and pork served with a tamarind sauce and shrimp crackers. If you like the Vietnamese version of papaya salad, you would probably like this as well. When it is the middle of July, you will not be in the mood for a big bowl of pho, but know there are still options."
0,"An over hyped Pho restaurant that did not even come close to meeting up to expectations. \n\nEveryone from Summerlin to Henderson has been telling me for months that Pho So 1 is the best Pho in Las Vegas. It might be the busiest Pho place in LV, but it is not close to being the best.  \n\nThe Pho was practically like boiled salt water. The broth was obviously rushed in preparations and served premature due to the overwhelming amounts of people rushing in the door.  I much prefer places like Pho Sing Sing where you can tell that they boiled the bones for over 20 hours because the broth is very oily and strong. \n\nThe vegetables in the spring rolls tasted like the cook collected the grass after he mowed his lawn and brought it to work with him.  \n\nThe service wasn't bad, they just didn't give us any service in the first place. After they brought us our food, we never saw another server again. I hate restaurants where you have to flag down the staff to get service. This is also one of those places where the servers will pretend they don't hear you so that they don't have to do extra work. \n\nThe restroom was horrible, even compared to horrible Chinatown standards. All I wanted to do was wash my hands and instead I had to witness a moment of horror! Two of the Spanish speaking cooks were having a conversation in the bathroom while one guy was taking a sh!t. The worst part was that the stall door was open and they were giving each other eye contact during this conversation. Let me remind you that one guy is taking a sh!t during this conversation. I so f*cking hope the guy washed his hands."
2,"This is such a difficult review to write.  The cage has really decent cheap food and an excellent selection of reasonably priced beers.  Unfortunately they frequently seem understaffed and it absolutely reeks of cigarette smoke.  Every time I go in I have to immediately wash whatever I was wearing and take a shower.  Even then I can always smell the smoke the next day. If you're a smoker this is a great spot.  If you're not, keep in mind that there is a visible cloud of cigarette smoke when you walk in."
1,"IIs a great idea but the service was horrible!! Once inside you get to choose from 5 mixed drinks on there menu and if you oped for the shot they had one choose, some nasty peach drink! + you can not bring in your cell or a camera! They charge $20.00 a picture that they take!"
4,"Great food, great beer, awesome live music! Best Irish pub in Town"
1,"The catfish nuggets were just ok. The fried shrimp was typical frozen grocery store shrimp. I was very unimpressed. I would like to go back to try the wings which are the main attraction here. Hopefully they will live up to my expectations. I also look forward to trying the kool aid. The prices were quite high for the quality, also. Will revise once I've tried the infamous wings."
2,"I have been trying this caf\u00e9 for more than two years now. I like especially the meal deal for my weekday lunches - for a fiver you get:\n - A sandwich or hot dog or a soup, \n - Hot drink (tip: you can have it take away if you like, just ask for it), \n - Fruit or crisps. \n \nThere are a few options for sandwiches. Hot dog was good but not something special. Unfortunately only one soup option per day, which might include meat, so if you're a veggieburger you will have to stick to the sandwiches selection. \n\nFruit option includes either a banana or apple most of the times (oranges make appearances too!). \n\nI did try once their pizza, kept my belly full for quite a while! There is a selection of toppings. \n\nThe coffees they make are decent - I would recommend trying out the white chocolate/mocha! \n\nFor sweet-tooth people out there, big waffle with cream and maple syrup is also recommended!! \n\nSetting-wise, big windows, close to the Haymarket station - I tend to sit right next to the window watching pedestrians and cars passing by, never stopping. It is above level street so you won't be alarmed by any pedestrians staring at you while you devour that waffle I mentioned above! \n\nWi-Fi does exist, although it requires a purchase and is time-restricted (ask for a code from the counter). \n\nThere is a variety of sitting areas as well: from normal wooden chairs and tables, to leather armchairs, and if you want to enjoy even more - try out the big comfy leather sofas! (assuming they're free, that is!) \n\nIt tends to be busy during lunch time, professional people do prefer it. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and doing their best to serve with a smile! :-) \n\nMy only inconvenient experience was when new staff was trained, and although there is the any-coffee-before-10-for-1.50 deal, I didn't pay attention and paid the full price. \n\nI would be happier if there were more soup choices and there were loyalty options for food too. \n\nComparing the options around this area, I will be going back to this for sure! :-)"
0,"I have been several times and nope it sucks. Back to Panda. The meat taste strange, I mean real strange. The Mongolian no matter how much Soy Sauce a molecule can take its still bland. At least at YC's or even Genghis Grill you have options. You will find that there are several dishes that are decent and its all chicken...I hope..."
3,"This place is a solid 3.5 stars in terms of quality of the room, pool, etc, but the great rate I got is going to bump it up to a 4!\n\nThis was my first time staying at the Monte Carlo. The staff we encountered (valet, front desk, etc.) were all very courteous and helpful. Our room was decent size, clean and for the most part comfortable. I may have high expectations when it comes to linens *SNOB ALERT*, I prefer down comforters and pillows, so I was slightly disappointed that they had neither. I also have had back problems, and this mattress was a little too soft for me, but I'm sure comfortable for \""normal\"" people =)  Other than that the temperature was easily adjustable to our preferences, the A/C didn't turn the room into a meat locker. \n\nOne of the reasons I wanted to stay here was I've been longing to spend some time in a lazy river, and according to their site, they have one. Perhaps I'll need to head to Raging Waters to satisfy that longing,  because what I was envisioning wasn't quite what was at the Monte Carlo. It's on the small side, and I wasn't willing to shell out $12 for a tube rental. Either way, my bf and I enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi. The pool area is clean despite it being very crowded on that particular Sunday afternoon. \n\nThe sweet rate I got was thanks to my MGM players club, I get emails on occasion from their casino marketing team, which you have to call in to take advantage of as opposed to booking online. I'm no high roller when it comes to Vegas, let's just say it really does PAY to look like an old gramma w/ your players card (bungee cord included so you don't forget it!) plugged into the slot machines while you gamble away.\n\nThis wasn't the BEST place I've ever stayed in Vegas, but definitely an option for when I return."
3,"Stayed here for two nights while taking a group of family members on a trip to Vegas. I'm not the type to gamble, but everyone wants to go to Vegas right. First, the rooms were clean and the hotel is modern, this is not a ghetto hotel like the ones in old town Vegas. Best of all, your at the heart of the Strip. The only thing I would avoid is the buffet, use your dinning credit at the steakhouse."
3,"For my 50th review I wanted it to be a place I newly am in love with which is Greens & Proteins! I've visited them three times now and each time is amazing. They have an amazing menu of healthy items suited for any diet from Atkins to HCG. G&P has it covered.\n\nOn my first visit I ate their Crab and Avocado lettuce cups. It was very tasty and healthy. The lettuce cups came loaded with real crab! Definitely worth the $9.99 price tag. I also had their Wellness Drink! Let me tell you I am totally in love with their Wellness Drink (minus the pineapple cause i'm allergic). It only has 286 calories and  tastes amazing. I love the green grapes and the fact that they use agave nectar is perfect for my diabetes!!! \n\nOn my next couple visits I ordered the Wellness Drink of course, but I brought my husband so I could try his drinks too! He tried the Apple Pie Smoothie. It totally tasted like apple pie! The one he got the other day though is almost as good as the Wellness drink ,but it's called the Tofu Banana Split! YUMMY! You can't taste the squash or any veggies that are in it. I recommend this one for your pickie eaters!\n\nGreens and Proteins has a nice friendly staff and they are pretty knowledgeable about the food. They are a bit pricey, but the quality of the ingredients makes it worth it to me. I can't wait to go back to try some of their other food items, but I'll be back every chance I get for that Wellness drink!"
2,The service is always great here!! The servers are so friendly and are always on top of everything. The first time I went to Firkin I ordered the chicken wings. They were super chewy and not very crispy (I like my wings well done). I would never order the wings again. But I gave the place another chance and I was pleasantly surprised. The Original Firkin Burger is excellent and the fish and chips are pretty tasty too! They had a great check-in for 10% off your bill and our server ended up giving us 15% off because my friend's burger was undercooked. So all in all pretty good experience.
1,"Taqueria Guadalajara it is not :(.\nBut honestly, what would compare? Mexico City? \nI had 4 taquitos but couldn't polish them off... super oily and the meat had little flavor. Just found myself going through the motions (chewing) and finally gave up. Chips are good, salsa reminds me of some weird sort of mix of tomato sauce from a can with onions and garlic, and I'll give them points for the guac, that was fresh and had nice flavor. And the staff, the staff is incredible, which is why it's hard to write this and steer folks other places in town, but after subsequent trips, I think I'd be cuco to give them another try when Madison is home to Mex that's a bit better."
4,"I have four gorgeous mutts---all shapes and sizes!  Michelle absolutely captured each of them invidually, as well as all of us together!  I had been wanting to have pics with my girls taken for years and finally did it!!!  \nMichelle came to the house and did an amazing job!  We actually took a picture in the bathtub and she made it look like we were all in a sleigh!  EVERYONE I have showed them to absolutely adore them!  I plan to use Cow Dreamz in the future --not sure where or when, but I will!  These pictures made many people happy! (not to mention...ME!!)  Thanks Michelle for a great experience - - for my furry babies and their Mommy too!"
2,"It pains me to write this review but it must be done.  I was so pumped about going to this restaurant while in Vegas unfortunately, it totally let me down.  We started with cocktails and salads.  I love a poached egg so I was excited to order the warm frisee salad.  It was just so so.  Next I ordered the sea scallops and brussel sprouts.  I know it is a steak house, but isnt like every restaurant in Vegas a type of steak house?  Therefore I had to stop eating steak at some point and try something else.  Can I say underwhelmed?  Lack flavor and just not worth the price tag.  My husband ordered the bison strip. It was eh, but the sauce was amazing.  Yum! I'd say the real star of the meal were the rolls they give you at the beginning of the meal!  I'd give it another try next time i'm in town because I love Tom Colicchio."
2,This place is funny!\n\nThey literally have a sign on the wall that says you can only sit and eat for a max of 20 mins!  So I hope you are hungry!!!
0,You are better off eating at a Panda Express in the projects. It would be cleaner there. That is all I have to say.
3,"Excellent! \nI haven't been to a Red Lobster in literally YEARS!!\nWe had recently ate at a \""high end\"" sea food place in town, with an unbalanced product:value ratio. Red Lobster was a refreshing surprise at a fraction of the price. \n\nGF had a gift card, so we popped in during Lobster Fest.\nEverything, and I mean EVERYTHING was great!!\n\nWe were quoted 45 minutes for a table and were seated in 20.\nEvery point of contact was polite, but casual. The biscuits are everything I was promised, the specialty cocktails are delightful, and specials really covered all tastes.\n\nI got two, perfectly cocked and wonderfully seasoned lobster tails.  \nGF had the Surf & Turf which she said was great, but wouldn't let me taste, as she was too excited to eat it herself. (j/k, she reads these)\n\nIf I had to lodge a complaint: \nThe water in the bathroom sink gets hot too fast.\n\nWe had an very good mean, with great service, for literally 1/3 of what we paid at a fine dining, sea food specific establishment (see next review)."
1,"After going through CSI: The Experience, and solving a murder myself, I don't see how the police every let a murderer go free? They are so easy to catch! You just look at the crime scene with the bag of drugs lying next to the dead body, and then check the victim's cell phone to see who sent her a text message saying \""let's meet up and do some drugs\"" right before she died, then you use the little slidey fingerprint matching thingy to find out who's prints are on the bag of drugs (same girl who sent the text!) and push the little buttons to do the chemical tests to see what changes color to figure out what the drug was, and viola! You just solved yourself a crime! After going through this, the only reason I could see the cops not catching a murderer is pure laziness.\n\nSeriously though, this is a pretty hokey \""Experience,\"" and it totally oversimplifies police work, even by the standards of the television show CSI. We had coupons for $5 off entry (somebody handed them to us on the strip) and it was still $53 total for two people. We were in there for maybe 40 minutes, because we went through everything thoroughly and had fun making fun of the exhibits. I had a good time going through here honestly, but I cannot whole-heartdly recommend it to you, because you may not."
0,"AVOID.\n\nI tried them again and they have gotten worse. \n\nCalled for supplies, and was told I had an outstanding balance.  Found out that A) Our bill was not late, and B) It was $11.  Can you believe these idiots?\n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID."
2,"Make sure you bring your bullet proof vest to eat with you when you go to Carolina's Mexican Food because you are going to need it! Carolina's is located in the most ghetto neighborhood in all of Phoenix. It doesn't matter how hard they try to make this neighborhood look good with new fire stations and the like, it is still going to be ghetto. \n\nI had three tacos. I was hoping for taquitos but they were no where to be found on the menu. The tacos I did have cost $2 each and they weren't any better than what I could have gotten at Dell Taco. If I had gotten three tacos at Dell Taco I would have only paid $1.28, but here I paid $6. Tacos don't even have tomatoes on them! The food comes in take out containers regardless of whether or not you are eating in or out. Don't expect a lot of food because the containers are not that large. The food my co-workers got didn't look that much better than mine. \n\nThe inside of this place is a real dump. For as much money as this place brings in, you think they could update it or add more seating. Even a new paint job on the interior and exterior would go a long way. Somehow they think people enjoy the charm of a dirty Mexican restaurant. I don't think that many people care, because they are there just to eat and get back to work as soon as possible, not to enjoy themselves. \n\nIf you go here for lunch, you will end up waiting in a long line. And seating will be hard to find as the place is packed during lunch. Carolina's is probably better suited for take out. They serve food like a cafeteria; you order from the menu and they call your number. It is quick authentic Mexican food, without the fast-food nostalgia."
0,"This is a great place if you enjoy truly, deeply crappy service and mediocre food.  It's so close to my house (just a short walk) so I really wanted this be an even-close-to-decent place due strictly to the convenience factor alone. Yet they were able to defeat even that.  \n\nI too tried a couple times, really hoping the initial problems were flukey or a bad night.  No luck.  You will sit there 30 minutes or more without anyone checking in or offering more coffee.  They will claim they \""didn't see you\"" or were \""too busy.\""  \n\nWhat I learned through a few ill-fated trips is that this taking-customers-for-granted approach is part of the culture of how they run the establishment as a whole. \n\nOn the up-side, it appears to be pretty clean."
1,"This is the slooooooowest Starbucks service in town.  Due to the convenience of the location, I stop in here for a coffee on occassion but I have to have plenty of time on my hands in order to do so.\n\n--parking is tight--"
1,"Small lounge on the way tothe pool at the MGM Grand.\nThere is nothing grand about this place ......\n\nThe Pina Colada ..... exactly like a snow cone ! ! !\nWhat a surprise.\nDrinks have no flavor .... they are like shaved ice........\nDrinks have a faint taste of pineapple and coconut.\nDevoid of alcohol\n32  hints that the drinks contain spirits.\nDo they really ???\n\nKids coming back from the pool could drink here ........\nthere is no need to be 21 to get served ....... \nthere is no alcohol ! ! !\n\nPeople coming from the pool in need of that cool drink are happy to stop here on a 103 degree afternoon. \nThey are already tanked from the pool and think this place is great.\nDrinks at the pool are supurb .....\nso you expect them to be good here as well .......   no they are not !\n\nSo try 32 again when you are sober ..... and see what you think ......\nBuyer beware.\n$ 9.00, $11.00 or even the bargain size at $12.00\nFor \""shaved ice\"" ??????\n\nGood service - hence two stars.\n\nCome on MGM - you can do better than this ........\nripping off pool customers ............... man-o- man !!"
0,"Sadly, Bono's has ceased operations at this location.  I miss them."
0,"Waited to be seated in near-empty restaurant. Waited. Waited. Staff walked past me as if I were not there. As I walked out, staff rushed to seat party behind me.\n\nI double checked that neither my hair nor my outfit were especially scary.\n\nIf it's your policy not to serve women over 35 dining alone, just put a sign in the window or something."
2,"The building's architecture is beautiful inside and out... and I absolutely love the Firebird statue out front. The downside is that the museum is on the small side and a bit sparse. \n\nBut, they do have a variety of art - including architectural sketches, a couple of lamps & furniture pieces, tapestries, oil paintings, prints, bronzes, sketch books, a nice alabaster, and some cool outdoor garden art out on the patio.  Lots of 1960's modern art.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate that the art they have is unique and worthy of a museum,  but it doesn't take long to get through the whole place.  Unless they host visiting exhibitions, I don't think I will be going back anytime soon."
1,"first id like to say everyone was very nice. that's about as far as the compliments go..\n\nIve had my manicure for about 26 hours now & all my nails are already chipped. my manicurist tried to send me out the door with nail polish all over my fingers due to his unsteady hand. i had to ask him to clean them up and he replied \""white is a very difficult color\"" he did try his best but i still wasn't impressed. i will never return here."
0,"Bland, blech, barf. \n\nThat's pretty much how I feel about Wild Thaiger. The food here is the farthest thing from authentic as it could get without venturing into Lean Cuisine territory. I suppose, though, it was the closest us downtowners had to real Thai, until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant moved in. (You are on notice, Wild Thaiger!) \n\nI think I gave it a fair shake. I ate here a total of four times, with different people and different food. I was not impressed once. In fact, I was pretty disgusted twice to find a long black hair weaving itself through my molded mound of rice. \n\nNo spice. No life. No business from me."
2,"I came in here because I needed an oil change before a road trip and they were open an hour later than the Meineke. I walked up to the counter 28 minutes before closing and was told the desk clerk would have to check to see if they could fit me in. I could hear the techs whining, which rubbed me the wrong way, but was eventually told it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nThe desk clerk was pleasant and they were done by 5 minutes before close (though I suspect is was more for their convenience than my satisfaction with their speed). Either way, for $40 I got my oil change before leaving for my trip and that's what mattered to me."
2,"La Fonda is ok.  The food is your usual choice of Mexican, served up with a healthy dose of grease.  The salsa is average at best and they have been caught reusing salsa, so that is something to think about before you go. \n\nI also do not recommend getting a Long Island iced tea from this place, unless you consider a Long Island to be bad tequila, bad vodka and some coke.  \n\nI have been here twice and was pretty unimpressed both times, but the place is always busy and has been around for a while, so I might just order all the wrong things."
4,always have a great time here.
4,My family LOVED this place! The falafel pita and plate were amazing. Quick service and delicious food. We will definitely be coming back here!
0,"Really poor service in the deli. They make you wait as long as they please, no manners while serving you, and claim different rules and conditions EVERY TIME you order a meal deal. I avoid this store at ALL COSTS."
1,"Have you ever ordered a dish, and then when the waiter comes over with a plate and says, \""[ridiculous, punny name]?\""...you just wanted to deny that you actually ordered that thing?\n\nThat's how I felt about the \""Yolk Around the Clock.\""\n\nThis dish was so visibly unappetizing, and once I started eating I confirmed that it also tasted pretty gross as well. The eggs were overcooked as opposed to overeasy, the bagels were burned, the cheese was burned, the \""perfectly spiced Lyonnaise potatoes\"" needed salt, pepper, and much, much less cardboard inside.\n\nIt's not that it was inedible, it's just that it wasn't very good."
3,"I went to Pita Pit for the first time using a Groupon deal.  Although I wasn't too impressed with the atmosphere (slightly unclean), I was quite surprised by the food itself which was quite tasty.  And that is even AFTER a 25 minute drive home before digging in!  I also thought the staff was very sociable and made a great recommendation for toppings on my Philly Cheese Steak pita (I know, I know...not the healthiest choice).  Groupon or no Groupon - I will be back!!"
3,"Delicious as usual, but this location is way super packed!  And can be a warzone to exit the parking lot back onto Tropicana."
0,"Went the first time, unbelievable eyebrow waxing and pedicure. Been busy with work and school, and really didn't have the time to take care of me. Had a free day yesterday and decided it'd be time to relax and visit again.... waited outside 45 minute because the sign out front was chipped and appear to say 10:00 am - but in reality must be 11... once 11 rolled around, a few older ladies showed up and ran with their walkers to the front door. After waiting 45 minutes I was rudely cut in line by 3 older ladies (and I do have respect for my elders), but cannot even begin to express my disgust for the staff who immediately sat them down in pedicure chairs and tended to them while blatantly ignoring me. My money is just as green as granny's and I tip all of my hair dressers, manicurists, waiters, etc. 20++%. \n\nNail 09 you saved me a dime... and helped me find an even better salon!"
2,"Went here for a fashion show for their \""Couture Fridays\"" event....no fashion show...very disorganized...\""models\"" were \""bottle rats\"" sitting at a table with the clothes on.. Not walking around or anything...\n\nif you're announcing an event ... go through with it."
0,"Well I've never felt compelled to make a yelp account in order to review a restaurant, but Yoshi Bento has motivated me to do so for serving what I would say was the WORST sushi I've ever had in my life paired with a sub par dining experience. It all started when I decided to venture out of the office on my lunch break to dine out at one of the many different restaurants at this particular plaza. Any of which I'm sure would have yielded a more pleasant experience than what I went through at Yoshi Bento. Sushi sounded good so I walked into this place and it smelled great so I thought I had made a good choice. I was wrong, very wrong. \n\nThe young woman behind the counter arrived at the counter to take my order promptly and was very polite. She explained that they had an \""updated\"" menu that had a special which included a dragon roll and a spicy salmon roll for $15. I was hungry so I took the bait and decided on a tuna dragon roll to accompany the spicy salmon. I paid and went to the restroom to wash my hands. \n\nUpon entering the restroom I found a dying COCKROACH on the ground. Seeing as how it was dying they must have some kind of pesticides working, but since there was one I got to thinking that there must be more where that came from...GROSS\n\n\nI sat down and contemplated telling the young woman asking for a refund and leaving. In hindsight that would have probably been one of the better decisions in my life, however I decided to take a chance and give Yoshi Bento a shot. I waited for 15 minutes from the time I placed my order. I wouldn't consider this an extremely long time to wait, but customers who ordered AFTER me were served before me and they had COOKED food. I know that making sushi is not easy, but I know that it should be quicker than cooked food. I've worked in a restaurant so I understand that certain things take more time, so that wasn't that big of a deal. The following is what WAS a big deal: \n\n\n1) They brought out 1 roll and then the second a few minutes later. I know this happens at restaurants all the time when it's busy, but when there are only 3 other groups of customers in the restaurant it shouldn't be that hard to have items come out simultaneously. \n2) The dragon tuna roll used yellow tail instead of sushi grade tuna (has a different color than regular tuna, is lower quality, and cheaper). Since I'm paying for sushi with tuna I would at least expect sushi grade tuna. Would probably fool just about anyone else though. \n3) Oxidized avocados on the inside of the roll (aka they were not freshly cut). I get that avocados oxidize easily, but put some kind of citrus juice on it to prevent this or cut a new one! Come on, it's just common sense who in their right mind would want to eat a brown avocado? I'm not talking about a little oxidation some of them were literally completely brown. \n4) The sushi was poorly rolled. Every single one of my dragon rolls fell apart at the avocado section. Granted sometimes sushi just falls apart, but I've been using chopsticks for more than a DECADE and have never had a sushi roll where literally every single one falls apart when I touch it. \n5) The \""spicy garlic\"" salmon roll was one of the nastiest roll I've ever had in my life. For starters the roll was DRENCHED in sriracha. I'm not being sarcastic it literally looked like a wet burrito you might get from a Mexican restaurant, which is very delicious, but not what I want on my sushi. I don't think that the fish on top was salmon either. It didn't taste like salmon, but I couldn't tell for sure since it was drenched in sauce. \n\n\nI should have asked for a refund once I saw the roach and gone somewhere else instead. However, I decided to roll the dice and by the time my food had arrived I was pressed for time and very hungry so I ate it. Maybe their cooked food is better, but I will never be back to find out. The cockroach was enough to make me never go back...\n\n\nI've eaten at a lot of restaurants and also had my fair share of sushi so I know what I'm talking about when I say this is some pretty terrible sushi as well as service. I hope Yoshi Bento sees this so they can improve for future customers, because this was the sorriest excuse for a sushi/ Japanese restaurant I've ever experienced."
1,"After reading the reviews of this place on here and on beer advocate I was really looking forward to this place. Once I got there the place was not at all what I was expecting. Kind of a strange place with a deli, convenience store, beer/wine store, and a small bar/eating area. They had a few good beers on tap, and a ton of good bottled beer as well. \n\nThat being said, the place seems a little disorganized, and there is not much in the way of seating. I had a question or two about some of the beers, and the employee that I talked to seemed to be annoyed that I had the nerve to bother him. Really the only thing that the place had going for it was the beer selection, and I would rather stick with Brawleys, especially given the difference in the level of service between the two..."
4,This place makes my favorite chicken fingers!!! So delicious and tasty!!! I like to mix the honey mustard with ranch. So good. \n\nMy boyfriend and I used to frequent here more often when Dale was the bartender. All new people now. Didn't even see new Mark last time. :( I'll still go though cuz they have the best chicken fingers in Vegas!
1,"I love beer gardens, and I love beer.  I am giving this place a two star, because on the night I went, they had a DJ blasting crappy music in the tent.  The whole point of beer gardens with the bench seating is to enjoy good music, and more importantly, good company.\n\nWihout the crap DJ, i'd give this place a 4 star.  I'll change my rating if I go and the ambience is better."
3,"I always love going down fremont street and watching the street show the last time I was there they had Kiss. There is always something going on and so many things to see they always have impersonators, a couple of weeks ago, they had spiderman,  they have a bunch of bars as well, that are very easy access,  I love the fact that they do not have all the \""clickers as I call them, as they do every five feet on the strip handing out porn cards\"" which is really ice. I also enjoyed watching people try to wiegh over 350 pounds at heart attack burgar on the scale that sits outside."
4,"Pan Asian is literally just down the street from where I am currently living at. It has been opened for only 2-3 weeks and without a splashy and eye catching sign, it may be easy to drive past on Durango unless you are really looking for it.\n\nThe restaurant has a large kitchen and prep area, but the dining area is comparatively small.  At the moment there are not too many tables and chairs setup (seating capacity is probably only at 16-20).  The interior is decorated simply but nicely.  The owner David Wong and his wife, the chef, are both super friendly.\n\nAfter my first spontaneous visit after just having had dinner at another new restaurant that recently opened just down he street, mainly based on Misti Y's positive comments about this new restaurant.  So I was looking to see what their menu offers and try some desserts.  The Thai dessert looks interesting, but I was told that it was not available that day and to try the Cheesecake Tempura. It was regular slice of cheesecake that was cut into smaller pieces and tempura fried. It has a different texture and if you enjoyed fried desserts, this one is probably something you should try.\n\nThe next day I dropped by after a stop at the Costco Food Truck Fest #2, and tried the Massaman Chicken Curry.  It was tasty and the portion was generous. Before I left, the chef also gave me a large cup of longan tea (on the house)  that she brewed from dried longan that her relatives visiting from Thailand had brought her.  The flavor is sweet, as it was sweetened with brown sugar, and maybe that was why it also reminded me of the Winter Melon Tea that I used to drink when I was in Taiwan.  I really enjoyed the drink and the generous gesture.\n\nDay 3, I had a Sababa Groupon to redeem before it expires. So after finishing the Sababa Special, which I thought would fill me up, I still had room for dessert and dropped in again to see if Thai Sticky Rice and Mango would be on the menu.  Lucky for me, the chef said if I was willing to wait a few minutes, she will make it from scratch for me.  It was a simple and very traditional Thai dessert served especially during the summer, when mango are in season.  And My T and his wife just happened to drop in for dinner.  \n\nWith a friendly couple that runs the restaurant and serving good food at reasonable prices, Pan Asian is already starting to get a decent Yelp following.  I know I will be back soon to try more of the menu.\n\nDecor:  4/5  Minimalist decorations that just works for the space.\n\nFood:  5/5 I enjoyed the food I have ordered thus far.  \n\nService:  5/5  The owner and his wife, Chef Lisa, are both super friendly. Can't have a meal prepared and served to you by a nicer couple.\n\nPrice/Value:  5/5  The price is fair and the portions are pretty generous. Lunch menu portion is the same as the dinner, so an even greater value.\n\nLocation is super close by, and even after I move a little further away, still worth the detour back from work or to satisfy a Pan Asian craving."
3,"This place is packed. Really cute, pretty average prices, except for the drinks because they are made of pure chocolate, so they are a bit pricey and my gosh are they decadent! Dang! \nReally cute for kids too becuase it's a place that specializes in chocolate...but also they have great crepes and chocolate liquer drinks. \nIt's one of those, well known and well-loved restaurants of Montreal. Worth going to at least once."
3,"This is a really cool venue, I like the chandeliers and the ambiance of this place.  There are 3 bars and ample restrooms so there is no wait.  Be prepared for $9 beers (24 oz cans).  There really isn't a bad spot in this place the only downside is they don't have seating, it's standing only so wear comfortable shoes!"
0,"Just went in to grab a small pizza after a 12 hour work day. Ordered a Casablanca WITHOUT mushrooms. Girl behind the counter even repeated it to me.....when I picked it up they repeated again NO MUSHROOMS and even opened the box to look at it...get home, SURPRISE!!!! MUSHROOMS. Baked all into this pizza. Thanks for the fungus. Make sure you check your pizza before you leave....."
2,"I love the firehouse theme, and like how the restaurant pays tribute to firefighters. The food was just okay to me though. It tasted just a tad bit better than Subway, and it was more expensive than $5 footlongs - so I'd doubt I'll return to Firehouse Subs.\n\nI ordered The Engineer sandwich - packed with turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms. There wasn't many mushrooms in my sandwich :( I really do like the original hot sauce. Definitely add that to any sandwich you try there. Maybe if I had kids I would bring them to this place, the kids meal comes with a complimentary firefighter hat."
3,"My family and I had dinner here during the week night, and it wasn't too busy.  We were seated right away at a table near the water fountain and had a nice view of the Buddha statue and with a pretty lotus flower sheer screen backdrop.  The restaurant has a nice tranquil ambiance with romantic dim lighting and modern Asian design. The service was friendly and attentive.  We had the tup tim fritters appetizer which were crispy chicken & shrimp dumplings with a chili sweet-sour sauce for dipping.  For dinner, we had pad thai with chicken and shrimp, brown rice and the tamarind seafood combo with crispy fillet of tilapia, shrimp, scallops and squid in a spciy sweet and sour sauce.  Our Thai appetizers and entrees were delicious but pricey."
4,"This is a really cool indie book store specializing in all things gambling.  Really first rate selection, and worth a trip for the bibliophile in Vegas."
3,"I'd like to give it 3.5 stars....\nThat said, Cha Da Thai is a good Thai joint.  Food is good, menu has a lot to choose from, and their curries are awesome.\nI've been a number of times and have only had one bad experience...I believe they had someone else doing the cooking that night."
4,"Best buffet in Vegas!\nNice clean place, ginormous buffet table, fancy food presentation, fast service, fresh seafood choices (cold and warm CRAB LEGS yoohoo!), a variety of intl dishes that taste authentic (other buffet dishes taste alike), unlimited wine and fancy desserts, gelato, ice cream and they even have a coffee bar.\nDue to its popularity, line can be long and waiting time can take hrs. But believe me, this buffet is definitely worth the wait.\nOverall, this is a must when you visit Vegas!"
2,"Ok, so we decided to give this place another try on a Saturday afternoon, when I had a mild hangover. I wasn't expecting much based on my last experience but sometimes the hangover belly just wants what it wants and this day it was saying chips with cheese! \nWhen we entered we were greeted and I asked to be seated at a booth. The host had to clean it off and did so without attitude which made me happy. Our waitresses was nice, to the point where she was almost too nice, you know the type, but she got the job done and the much needed food to us in a timely manner so that's all I could ask for. \nAll in all, I guess I still have a bad taste in my mouth from the first experience here but after this time I will be happy to go back and give them another try since I'm still a sucker for the food."
2,"Okay so Easter Sunday did not turn out as I had planned but further more I was glad that I didn't have to end up in the ER for an ear infection. This place has the greatest concept of checking in online and waiting at home and that is exactly what I did. I checked in at 3am because that is the time I woke up with a horrible earache and received a call around 7:30am saying doors open in 15 minutes and I was the first one on the list to be seen. I got there right on time and 5 minutes after me a man arrived. Well they saw him first which annoyed me, obviously. I was told I was 1st to be seen and showed up 1st but for some reason he was seen 1st so that was strike one. Second strike was the MA. She was very rude and she thought that I was an idiot and had no idea what I was talking about. When asked if something was normal for me I replied no and then she said, \""well that's normal for everyone else so something is wrong with you.\"" Well excuse me but I am no dummy and I know what is and isn't normal for my body. Anyhow the PA was alright not the greatest bedside manner but we got passed  that. I was just appreciative that I could figure out what was wrong with me in a timely manner and got the meds to hold me over til I can see a specialist. If you want you also have the choice to purchase the scripts for a flat rate right there which is very easy  for many."
3,"I feel like reviewing an airport is similar to reviewing my utilities provider.  Unless I don't like hot water, it doesn't really matter what I think of their customer service.\n\nWith that said, I do like this airport, because it has lots of security checkpoints that work relatively smoothly, and plenty of different areas to wander aimlessly.  They also have plenty of shops/restaurants to visit when your flight is delayed and you are powerless to do anything but keep opening your wallet to the airlines."
0,"Better Italian food at Olive Garden and that's saying a lot! \n\nNew to the area I decided to give this place a try and unfortunately it'll be the last time. \n\nHappy hour is not happy hour, the waitress who wasn't familiar with the menu had to keep coming back and telling me all the things I couldn't get. Not a great business strategy. \n\nWorst of all I couldn't customize my order which was shocking. You'd think if I could have a burger made my way at a fast food joint that they could customize your meal for the price you're paying here! So be careful if you are allergic or really dislike certain foods. It also worried me that the food isn't being cooked to order because of this and perhaps just frozen bulk that's reheated. \n\nI ordered the spinach manicotti which I forced myself to finish because I felt bad for my friend who had offered to pay.  \n\nThe food was lukewarm at best, not presented well and I felt ill after it all. \nI won't be returning, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area to choose from."
0,"Aside from the bouncers being rude, the drinks being watered down, and the music being so loud that you can't hear yourself think, this club was still unbelievably terrible! Ladies, avoid this place at all costs!!! You would think that having a bouncer offer to take you to the VIP area would be fun, but in reality they are just parading you around like hookers until one of the \""VIP\"" guys allows you to stay in hopes of getting sex for free alcohol. We left within a minute. If you like being treated like a cheap whores by nightclub staff then this place is for you, if not then stay away! The only decent part of the place was a nice roof terrace, but it definitely isn't worth it. Go to Chateau in Paris instead."
0,"May be a decent place to eat hibachi...BUT NOT sushi or sashimi!!!!  I have tried Nakama's 3 times to be fair.  Nakama can not live up to it's name as a \""Sushi Bar\"".  Don't waste your time, money or taste buds...."
0,Fun food but AWFUL SERVICE our meals took forever to make it to the table and the waitress mite as well been none existent. Definitely not worth the 40min wait to get a table (when there was empty tables everywhere)
3,"Pinatas is one of the few mexican restaurants with a 'modern' design. It's very refreshing to have zero = pinatas, blankets or sombreros on display.  Pinatas has more of a clean, minimal, slightly industrial look.\nPinatas menu offers slightly 'fancy mexican' entrees. Better quality items with alot less grease. My favorite dish is the spinach enchiladas! There are some awesome Happy hour specials, BUT, at the bar and on the patio beware of the blaring sun. Pinatas bar faces West. (Sunglasses Needed after 3pm).\nFYI- possible melting and blindness may occur while chugging yummy margaritas.  \nFry's Shopping Center at  Hayden/ Thompson Peak -just north of 101"
3,"This place wouldn't normally deserve a 4 star from me, but definitely had some redeaming and over the top qualities.\n\nWe showed up to blarring, painfully loud jazz music being busted out by a band with a combined age of probably about 300, but it was good music still. There wasn't any wait staff because it was a regular weekday, but the tap selection immediately caught my eye. Delirium Tremens, Anchor Steam, Leinenkugels, Sierra Nevada, Chimay, and oh so many more. Impressive!\n\nThen....there was a message from heaven in the form of a display on the TVs that said \""Over 1,000 beers in the fridge, and 600 whiskeys in the attic,\"" and my heart melted where I stood.\n\nDespite any other short comings, the place was HELLA amazing to find in such a random place, and I'll definitely head back again with a troop of my alcoholic friends whenever I get a chance to while I'm in Vegas again!\n\nThanks for a great time."
0,"I was pleasantly surprised to receive a call from the owner yesterday in regards to my experience at The Dog Wash. I explained what had happened during Milo's grooming visit and she offered a blameless apology. I find it very comforting to find people that can apologize for a situation instead of passing the blame along to the next person, even when they were not at fault to begin with. She informed me that the person who groomed my dog on Saturday is no longer with the company and she asked if I would be willing to give The Dog Wash another chance. I was hesitant, but because of her sincere and helpful customer service I decided to give it one more shot. \nI won't give it a 5 star rating just yet, I still have to say what Milo's hair will look like, but it is a step in the right direction."
4,gone!!!! finally went out of business. Can't believe it took This long.  Wonder what's coming next.
3,"A rainy evening a couple of weekends ago, my group of friends dropped into Yo Rita for a late Saturday evening dinner before dodging the crazies in the Southside bars. First off, this place is super cute, and you wouldn't know that necessarily from the frosted front windows. Dim lighting, candles, lounge-y electronic music, and a sleek set-up make it a very low-key but chic place to go out. Secondly, their menu is primarily set on one of two things: drinks, primarily margaritas, and tacos. But these aren't your average Chipotle tacos. These are GOURMET NIRVANA tacos. I ordered the flank steak and shredded chicken tacos and they were the best tacos I have had in my life. It was a smart call making a restaurant cater to 2 specialties, and they got them down pretty well. In addition, their margaritas were also a treat. I had a ginger lime margarita (more like, 2) mostly because I could barely taste the alcohol. My girlfriends had the classic margarita, but I saw many other mojito/margaritas on the menu, so next time I come back in the next month or so, I will be ordering something different. Overall, if you want to have an a-typical gastrotrip in Pittsburgh, I highly recommend Yo Rita."
0,"If you don't like having smooth, relaxing craps, and pleasure yourself in hot, anus ripping diarrhea, then look no further- Basha on Sherbrooke and University is the place for you!\n\nThis lovely little toilet nightmare is placed in the basement suite of an old, semi-abandoned office building, sharing its prime real estate with a shady currency exchange store that opens for only 3 hours a day and a Tim Hortons above it that, for lack of a better word, is as pleasurable in dining as is eating the asshole an obese computer technician named Fred.  The decor in this Basha's is lovely:  it features crumbling drywall, piss yellow cracked paint, and an orange trim that is peppered with cigarette burns and ashes from the staff after working hours.  The floor is also missing a few tiles and it's been mopped with outdated cleaning products from the 50's that smell like ass-juice vinaigrette.  The decor and ambiance of a Middle Eastern building in the midst of a warring conflict is achieved in all 5 senses...truly a design award is necessary for this place.\n\nThe food is affordable...some would even argue cheap as hell.  And hell it does seem to exemplify once tasting it.  The hummus is about 5 days old and unrefrigerated, giving it an extra bit of sour mold to for a reduction in taste, while the kebab meats are uncooked, still dripping fresh in its juices when killed when served to you coupled with vegetables from Lobo.  If you're lucky enough, this delicious meal will also include an extra bonus of a piece of fur or bone from the mystery meat you adventurously embark on tasting.  This is truly a wonderful spoof at the poverty some must undergo in the slums of war torn countries and the owners do an excellent job simulating poverty's finest dishes to an elite group of college students.  Truly, this ploy of forcing empathy through taste is a great charitable cause and is noteworthy in decor, ambiance and especially in inducing you to excretion levels so high that your bowels and esophagus will be taken to unseen heights."
1,"I'm not really that contrary. The food's good, but inconsistent. The service is either intrustive (I am so tired of server's asking me two or three times, \""Is everything alright?\"" If it's not, I'll d****** well tell you), it's noisy at times, slow and for the money, go to Bouchon or Prime. And, yes, we've eaten there a half dozen times, but no more."
1,They open for lunch loosely around 11:30.  Gird your loins!! \nThis restaurant is so noisy you literally can't hear your party \nThe food was a good quality however I suspect as its new things  come off the menu\nPizza is to me spongy. Ordered a margherita not crisp at all\nBe sure to ask for your wine in a stem not the jelly jar glass they provide.  It really changes the taste of the wine.The pizza was taken off bill without asking  and we were asked by several different people if they could make something else . I told the chey no thankyou as the noise level was so uncomfortable I couldn't stand the wait.  He was visibly irritated.
0,"DIRTY!! Both the floors and bathrooms, who knows about the kitchen. Just in the bar area alone you could see, from the waiting area, napkins, fries, chips, crayons, even an eaten rib on the floor! \nWent and used the restroom and you could see scuff marks and napkins all over the floor, plus no where to hang your purse, disgusting, it's like they don't even care! \nAfter seeing all of that we definitely didn't want to eat there, walked in then right back out. Chili's seems to have lower their standards over the years :( left dissapointed and hungry. \nThankfully with so many other restaurants in the area it was easy to find somewhere else to better spend my money."
4,I love all of the vegetarian jerky and miso! Great selection and amazing bakery. Love the coffee pudding and all of the cakes are so delicate and not decadent which I like. I enjoy the almond cream horn! Also try the jubes and canned roasted eel! Mmm! Great place to get special oriental ingredients. Don't go to the regular grocery store because it's cheaper to get them here!
2,"I always end up eating at this Subway.  I really like my chicken teriyaki salads.  However, some of the workers are really... interesting people.  There is an older man who literally takes ten minutes to make a salad or sandwich because he doesn't understand English very well.  Then there's another young guy who doesn't listen and puts the wrong things on the sandwich (even if you repeat the same word over and over... if I say \""pickles... pickles... PICKLES!\"", I probably want pickles).\n\nStill, this is down the street from my apartment.  It's clean enough.  The service is lacking, but not enough for me to avoid the place.  Whatever.  It's Subway.  If I want a gourmet meal, I'll go elsewhere."
0,"This review is purely for the frozen yogurt.  This is my first 1-star review.\n\nI really feel bad for the people who gave this place 4+ stars for their yogurt because that means they don't know what good froyo tastes like!!  It breaks my heart :(\n\nIf you're from southern California where froyo shops are plentiful, steer clear of this place.  The yogurt has an odd flavor.  The fruit wasn't ripe either.\n\nMy friends and I had a $50 room credit to use that night since we were leaving the next morning so we thought we'd shave some of it off by getting a little froyo and using the rest for drinks or food later.\n\nWell a little froyo (i.e. 3 yogurts) cost us a whopping $25.91.  Are you shitting me?  Even the highest-priced yogurt shops like Pinkberry and Red Mango will cost you an average of $5 a pop.  So yes, close to $9 per really-shitty-tasting yogurt is an outrage.\n\nThe kicker?  Even though we confirmed with them that they accepted room credit, they weren't able to pull it up on the system which meant we had to pay for said yogurt.\n\nLet me tell you right now that when we reached the front desk, I raised an uproar until the woman would change our room credit to $75 since it was their fault that we were in this mess in the first place.  Though, it's Blizz's fault for having such crappy yogurt.\n\nI have yet to try any of their other items.  After my experience with their yogurt, I don't want to."
1,"Went for Brunch, the food was very good unfortunately the service let them down... I felt like we were a burden to them, our server was rude & got the order wrong, they were not busy but yet seemed to want us out ASAP"
2,"my review is more like a 3.5. My attempt to find the best burger in Las Vegas continues. I am still at heart, an in-n-out fan, with Five guys coming in at a close 2nd. Freddy's has only one location in the entire Las Vegas. It just happens to be down the street from my dentist. I got the #7. which is a double steakburger with bacon. unlike Five guys, in-n-out or even smashburger, their burgers are pressed, flattened sort to speak.  It was good, but i prefer my burgers thick and meaty.the flavors were right and overall it was a good burger. The service was fast, the place was really nice. It was busy, i dont know if it is because this was the only location in town, or because the area is just really busy. They serve shoe string fries, really thin, with very light seasoning. different, but good.. but nothing amazing. The highlight was probably  their custard. Again, not too sweet, and they had fry sauce. which was basically a thousand island with a little less zing, not bland, but mild. I would go again, but only if i am on that side of town,  I wouldn't drive that far, for a burger."
0,"pizza is horrible. \n\ndepends what you like i guess.  if you like drinking  three cups of grease,  per slice then its great...\n\ni hate it. \n\ni do not understand why people like this place."
2,"Ketchup burger bar is located right in front of the miracle mile parking lot, a very convenient spot, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the mushroom burger combo meal ($16) for my wife and western burger combo meal ($17) for myself. The burger is good but not good enough for $33. It tastes exactly like \""Carls Jr\"". Luckily I bought a $22 gift cert for $11 at amazon local. So including the tax and tip and the amazon local gift cert, the meal is just under $30."
4,"So cute! While I didn't try the food, they had great gluten-free baked goods with a lot of variety. Loved the chocolate chip cookies and the donuts were pretty good too for being gluten-free.."
2,"I suspect I'm going to review this again at some point as I feel I haven't had the full bbl experience. \n\nMy colleagues at the copy shop tell me that this place is the biz for a breakfast roll. I decided to try it out shunning my regular place (oh the guilt!) it turns out this place makes it's own Link and Lorne sausages! So I went for a double deviation and went for a Lorne over a black pudding. Soft juicy goodness, the guy behind the counter even let me try a link for free! The meat is well cooked here, no dried out chewy nonsense here. As for the flavour though I didn't really think it was an awful lot to shout about. \n\nI also returned here for lunch as their fillings looked and sounded appetising. I opted for a chicken fajita panini, and was a little underwhelmed by it. \n\nI've heard from Blythe via Cressi that the burgers here are top notch, and I ought to check the coffee too. So far so good though, just nothing too amazing either."
0,Great view of the Bellagio fountains. Food and service was a total missed.
3,This was our best fairmont stay and our favorite farimont resort. Could have not been better. Thank you. First class.
0,Charging restaurant prices for fast food : $11 for a plain burger and fries cooked THEIR WAY -well done - or the hwy.  The kids working behind the counter were very nice but there's nothing they could do about it.\n\nConsumers (including Yelpers ) seem to hold low expectations for their money.
3,"It's not your typical farmers market. It is a farmer's market and general market where you can pick up produce, lunch, and other arts and crafts. \n\nGenerally I love looking around at farmer's markets and trying all the foods. I am glad I went to this market because I got to try the Authentic Mexican Shrimp Cocktail! I've had some awesome Shrimp Cocktail before, so it was even more awesome to stumble upon this and find it to meet and exceed my expectations!\n\nIt is 100 times better than the normal shrimp cocktail. This is in a tomato-y cocktaily lime with avocado goodnesss. I would go back to the market just to see this guy again and to buy another bowl of legit mexican shrimp cocktail."
2,"My friend and I came for one of our friend's weekly pool parties. They go so much, they call themselves the Cabana Crew. I don't know exactly what I was expecting, since my fianc\u00e9 use to work the pool at the Mirage, and worked Bare a few days a week over the summer, and tried to describe it to me. I personally would not have expected it to be so close to the main pool area. \n\nThe pathway to get to Bare takes you through the main pool first, where families and kids are around. And let me tell you, the things that people wear at Bare... they should not be walking around kids like that.   I even felt a bit uncomfortable walking through. \n\nThe venue was incredibly small. For those who have been to Wet Republic... this is about a fourth of that size. I think that even Daydream at the M Resort is bigger.  We were there on a Sunday I believe, and it was no particular special weekend. We had one of the cabanas, with the very large beds. I am not a total fan of these.... if you have a group of people. You have to climb into this large cabana bed and practically snuggle with everyone else.\n\nI didn't end up going into the pool. By the time I wanted to, the pool was packed. And some of the things that were going on in that pool, would have made me concerned of catching a UTI, or STD. It gets awfully crowded as well. I almost felt as if I was staring into a can of human sardines. \n\nHad a great time though. It isn't my first choice ultra pool. I am more of a relaxed lounging person, but with so upbeat good music and a relaxed crowd. However, if you are looking for a \""day party\""... I would recommend this place. Also, try to get passes if you can. Its kind of pricey from what i hear for the cover. \n\nAgain, not my first choice, but I would go again if/ when my friends invite me. I wouldn't buy a cabana here though, or come on a whim"
3,"Delicious salads however you want!  I lived in NYC and you could always find a quickly tossed salad to go to keep you commuting food on the healthier side.  Great selection and fresh.  It is not cheap, but affordable for a good quality, fast meal.  I highly recommend the corn agave dijon dressing."
0,"Food prices and service still \""SUCK\""  stay away!!!!!"
3,Great restaurant! We were staying by the airport for the night and il Fornetto was the right choice. I ordered the Veal Parmigiana and started with the Fried Calmari -- both were exactly on point. The experience of sitting outside while dining here was fantastic. I would highly recommend you try this place if you're in the area. Everyone I was with enjoyed their dish! YOU SHOULD GO.
3,"The Comet's a great place for a beer with friends, but the real star of the show is, well, the live show.\n\nThe Comet's got a great line up of live music, and the place gets hopping regularly.  There's nothing that compliments a good beer (or a cheap beer for that matter) better than some raucous country music.\n\nGo and get yourself a beer and a balcony seat.  You'll enjoy your evening."
1,"Everyone is very nice in Raising Cane's.\nTaste is really average, nothing even close to famous chicken finger."
2,Had the Parmesan Crusted British Columbia Sanddabs.  Eh.  Too much parmesan crust that I couldn't really taste the actual fish itself.  Had cheesy grits as a side - bleh.  From the taste of it - the cheese was somekind of processed velveeta like cheese.  Yuck.  What I thought was really good was the grilled zucchini.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The highlight of the meal.
0,"Bad service and mediocre food marked our dinning experience. a\nAfter waiting one and a half hours, we left without our meal and wound up eating elsewhere."
4,"This is definitely a really great taxi service, especially if you are in a rush.  Since it's the summer, the buses don't run normally on campus and it's really inconvenient. I needed to go to Illinois Terminal within half an hour to catch a bus(which would be difficult with public transportation from where I live) and Mr. Abdul was reliable, on time, and friendly. I ended up being a bit early for my bus.  Would definitely recommend!"
4,"$250 for two nights what more you ask for a great suite and great view. I have never seen so many tv screen in one room! I will definitely book a room for my next visit in Las Vegas. I had a relaxed stay, friendly staff and the best of all the casino isn't as smokey as the other casinos out there.\n\nWe had 1 king size bed, remote control for your tv and the curtains? Nice :)"
2,"Blush is a boutique club, so I was expecting it to be a small club. If anything, I would describe this place as a lounge. If you do not get table service, you will find yourself bumping elbows with strangers by the bar area or just awkwardly standing around.\n\nBecause of the loungy feel, you also don't get a lot of dancing in. I went on a weeknight which was full of locals but they had a great special. Free admission as long as you were on the guestlist, and open bar for the ladies.\n\nI just want to clarify their open bar- it's not really open bar and they take advantage of it. I ordered a drink and when they gave me a bill of $15, I looked at them very confused. They told me that the only thing that can account for \""open bar\"" are sky vodka with 1 mixer or their house champagne - say what!? You should have mentioned that at the door rather than attract us to go in with your \""open bar\"" pitch.\n\nNevertheless, still worth it if you don't mind having vodka-cranberries or vodka-fruit juice throughout the whole night"
0,"I hate douche security guads at Marquee with a passion.\n\nI came here twice for nightclub. Once during Armin van Buuren on memorial day weekend and this past halloween weekend for ATB and Armin van Buuren.\n\nThe first time around I paid $40. Second time around I got in for free because of guest list but it is besides the point since I don't care to drop some money in order to have a good time But no, Marquee doesn't let me have my grand time.\n\nDuring the peak hour, dance floor got super spacked both times. My friends and I were locked out unless we paid the bouncer. We paid $20/person and it just went downhill from there. People are shoving left to right, elbowing you, stomping on you, etc. A couple in their 50's kept shoving me to go to the front so I pushed the guy really hard and he looked at me like if he was going to hit me. Dude, don't shove your way in if you can't handle people shoving you back.\n\nMy point being: fck marquee. I'm sticking to other clubs like Tao & XS regardless of the fact that they bring in awesome DJs."
2,"I will never order from this place again!!!  I placed an online order at 3:50PM and received an email confirmation that it would be ready at 4:20PM.  I call at 4:50 to find out where my pizza is and am told by the guy who picks up that they never received my order and that there online order system is down and they have no cooks in the kitchen to make full pizza orders but they are still serving slices.  I ask him whether my card will be charged since the system is down.  He says no.  Immediately I check my account online and sure enough there is pending transaction for $23.69.  So I guess they're system wasn't down after all.  More likely they forgot to make my order and instead of simply apologizing and offering to make the order now, the guy lies to me and tells me their system is down and they don't have cooks in the kitchen but they're open for business and still serving slices of pizza, just not full pizza orders.  Which doesn't make any sense at all because either he's lying about not having any cooks in the kitchen or they're serving people frozen re-heated slices of pizza and calling it fresh.  Either way, thank goodness for bank charge backs.  I had the transaction reversed within minutes when I contacted my bank.  Mama Mia pizza has lost a customer for life.\n\nUPDATE:  The owner called me back to apologize almost an hour later and offered to make me my pizza.  I've revised my rating to 3 stars because they do have good pizza.  But don't ever order online.  This place can't handle online orders and this is not the first time I've had problems ordering online with them.  Personally, I don't think I'll be going back."
2,I've been going here since it was located on Thomas. The ice cream is very good. They make their own ice cream and it is rich. There are a number of flavors (some seasonal) that will keep you busy. Their food is average and midwestern. There are definitely some problems when it comes to the staff. It saddens me to think of how it used to be. I have been there on a number of occasions when the death metal in the kitchen drowned out the fifties music in the dining area. \n\nMy niece and nephews enjoy the heck out of it though.
4,"It seems that every which way you turn these days there are more and more gluten free pizza options showing up around the valley. Pizza joints around Phoenix have all gotten on the bandwagon since they see how big a demand there is for gluten free pizza in Arizona and how our little community votes heavily with our dollars - even in our current economic climate. Will I pay $15 bucks for a good gluten free pizza? You betcha!\n\nSpinato's was recommended to me by my co-worker as the best place for pizza in Phoenix. That was a pretty bold statement to make since there are so many good pizza places in town, and boy, Gary was right. I was blown away by Spinato's.\n\nFirst of all, the pizzeria is tucked away in a business park behind Tempe Marketplace and unless you know someone \""in the know\"" you'd probably never stumble upon it yourself. This place is no frills - block walls, old concrete floors, and simple table setups, but the food is far from simple. It's fresh, cooked to order, and the service was fantastic.\n\nThey have an entire menu devoted to gluten free item's, so there's no guesswork involved with ingredients or which combo's you can eta, etc..... I had the \""Nicole's Favorite\"" pizza, which is Gluten Free Creations Signature crust, topped generously with slices of Genoa salami, artichoke hearts, onions, and lightly sprinkled with mozzarella cheese. It was perfecto!\n\nNow, let's talk about the sauce. I think their pizza sauce may actually be the best pizza sauce I've ever had. It was slightly sweet with loads of fresh tomato flavor, and perfectly seasoned. Each bite was a perfect balance and I had to refrain from eating the whole darn pizza so I didn't look like a total pig to my new co-workers. I politely took half home and then devoured the rest at 4:00 as a late afternoon lunch.  \""Nicole's Favorite\"" is now \""Jessica's Favorite! Well done Spinato's!"
1,"Came for Happy Hour on Friday Sept 26.  We were seated promptly.  The waiter took our drink order, then returned ten minutes later.  We ordered a few happy hour appetizers.  We asked for some bread & butter while we were waiting. He advised us that b & b is usually not served during happy hour but he will make an exception & bring us some (really?). The appetizers came out but not b & b. Although, a few dollars less expensive during Hh, they were bland.  The waiter returned after we were done & asked  if we would like another round of drinks but we declined. Still waiting for the b & b. Needless to, say, we never received any, no apology & not even mentioned.\nWe paid the check, and will never return.  Food was Meh and service was sub par.\nBTW, the place needs a makeover"
4,"You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. I haven't had a bad dish here. Phyllo packets, fez salad, fez burger, kisras, all melt in your mouth.  If you like real garlic-e humus, give it a try.  It's awesome!  Oh, all the martinis are just great too.  Candice is the best sever there just in case you care.  They never disappoint!"
2,"I don't know many people who come to the Vegas Strip to watch a movie but this is a good place to beat the heat, kill some time, and maybe take the kiddies if they've run out of family friendly things to do on the Strip.\n\nThe UA Showcase Cinemas are located right around the corner from Coke World and tickets are available for purchase at a kiosk next to M&M World. The theater isn't anything special but it has A/C on full blast and the seats are somewhat comfy with plenty of leg room.\n\nThis theater also offers $7.50 matinees which for me turned out to be a convenient 3 PM matinee. Score! I don't know any other place in the country that offers first run movies that cheap. I spent my last day in Vegas watching Oceans 13 (the perfect Vegas movie to end a Vegas trip). It was entertaining and yes Brad is still munching in this film."
1,We stopped at the P.U.B. (what's with the periods?) before seeing Viva Elvis at the Aria Hotel and Casino. All we wanted was a quick bite to eat - and that's what we got. I had a Cheese Sandwich - which was OK. Nothing to write home about. Others had a bison burger which looked good - but didn't really elicit any response. The beer list is quite extensive - there are even beer cocktails. Naturally the one beer I wanted was out of stock.\n\nService was kind of hit or miss. We had to wait for a table even though there were plenty of tables unoccupied. Our waiter took his sweet time - so we asked for the check the minute the entrees came out.\n\nOh and he wouldn't split the check between more than 3 people. Really? In this day and age? That alone is a reason not to go back.\n\nSo basically it fit the bill for a quick bite to eat - but that's not enough to recommend this place.
1,"If you are looking for a health provider that comes with endless waits, resentful front desk personnel, and a musty smell of cigarette breath, this is the one for you! On the other hand, they do have a pharmacy conveniently located in the building and it is one stop shop for general medical, vision, and other services. But you'll need a healthy sense of self-esteem, a strong ability to deal with embittered people, and about 90 minutes of something to do while you wait for the appointment they so aggressively compelled you to show up for 20 minutes early."
0,"Where to begin...\n\nWhat was supposed to be a 20-minute wait for our group of 5 ended up being a solid hour. \n\nI ordered the crab cake eggs benedict. When it finally arrived nearly 45 minutes later, the eggs were overcooked and the crab cakes were undoubtedly frozen, store-bought and probably made with imitation crabmeat. They tasted like high school cafeteria fish sticks. Furthermore, it wasn't until everyone's food was delivered that my friend was told they were out of his entr\u00e9e, corned beef hash. \n\nThe orange juice and skillet potatoes were good, but that's about it. This restaurant could be much better, but they've got some service and kitchen management issues. I can't say I'll be coming back."
2,"Food was good, service was better! Good enough to go back again with a nice warm atmosphere. To eat, had the Caesar salad and the mushroom prosciutto pizza. Salad had old lettuce but fresh slices of Parmesan cheese. Pizza was great, very lean prosciutto and the crust was nice and crispy with a great charred taste."
3,"I shop here a lot when it comes to work clothing.  At every Macy's I notice the clothes tend to point towards the clientele and over at Metro the clientele must be damn broke or ghetto fab, so now I shop here and fashion square.\n\nThe store has a wide selection for anyone's taste and the prices run from pennies to thousands, depends on what you're looking for.  They always have a great sale going on too so I tend to get really good deals on things.  I've yet to buy anything that fell apart and I was angry with, doesn't mean it can't happen or hasn't happened to others but I've been pretty lucky personally.\n\nThere are a few cashiers there, that even though I only return once in a blue moon, they always seem to remember my name and are very helpful with me.  They know my style and taste so when they point something out I might find cute I'm not annoyed because these people know me well.\n\nIt can get messy at times but really what department store doesn't.  Even the fabulous Fashion Square gets a little messy when you see it packed elbow to elbow with wild women hunting through sizes on a blow out sales day.  I'm a fan for sure."
4,This is my go to Chinese food joint. Their sesame chicken is so incredible and also the crab puffs are amazing. They always seem to really appreciate my business when I come in. I will definitely visit again in the future.
0,"The d stands for dump. Though this hotel advertises its newly remodeled room this place is still old and falling apart. The remodel consists of a few cosmetic cover-ups, dancing girls showing some skin, and loud music. The bathtub felt like you would fall to the floor below when you stand in the wrong spot and was chipping off all over. The drawer on our dressor wouldn't closed and was propped up by a piece of paper. Sadly, our room was the upgraded premium corner king. The view was probably the only saving grace. The elevators are supposed to be an upgrade but they are TERRIBLE! So slow and confusing for many. Overall, a dump with a fancy paint job"
2,quality in the food is inconsistent. i'm sure it depends on the cook of the day.\n\nthe only thing that consistently not dry and full of gristle is their pulled pork.\n\ni have 2 groupons for this place and i'm hoping to try their catfish.
4,"This is my daughter's favorite Thai restaurant, so she took me here for my 70th birthday.  I always have Green Curry the first time I try a Thai restaurant - and was extremely happy!  One of the best, anywhere!"
4,"This show is amazing.  We went this past Saturday night. I convinced my friend Kim to get up on stage.  She ended up going under and staying under through the entire show!! Can we say hilarious!  Marc was very personable, funny and outgoing!!  I can't believe the thing my friend did.  For example she would never pretend to do a pole dance in front of me, let alone a group of strangers!!! I wish he would have asked for their stripper names. I would have loved to hear what my friend came up with!! If you have any doubt about hypnosis, go to the show and volunteer!! Marc will make a believer out of you!!"
2,"The regular food is, well... okay. But frankly, for the same money you can go to the store and get the salad fixings you like, and it will last you a week.\n\nHOWEVER, you have to go in on Sunday mornings. Great breakfest buffet. I especially like this because I don't like cooking breakfast. I'm tired and I'm hungry - who wants to mix waffle batter half asleep?\n\nBut I am saying it's bad for kids so you leave them at home. I hate children, and I hate yours more. Buy them a cage before you go out to places I suggest!"
4,"I got a referral to Airepros that was so strong it made me suspect.  It was the first serious hot spell of the summer and the air went out in a third of my house.  With 10 year old units I was certain they were going to sell me a whole new unit and hit me for top dollar because of my urgent need.  The technician showed up within the hour, identified the problem, went above and beyond to do a little re-engineering of the weak link that caused my problem and was finished that same afternoon for only $200.  They are the only company I will ever use or recommend and if they quote me a couple thousand instead next time, at least I will be confident it is legitimate."
4,There is no other way to see a movie !! Great dining and plush lounge seats ! Waiter  on hand ya baby
4,"I chose the Signature because the price was great for the suite I wanted but was sold on the fact that the whole hotel is non-smoking and there was no casino in the hotel.  I don't gamble and can't stand the smell of smoke (I know...what the hell am I doing in Vegas, right? hahaha)\n\nAnyway, the hotel was so nice that we decided to extend our \""quick overnight getaway\"" to a three day holiday.  I had made some arrangements with the hotel for a surprise birthday celebration and it somehow got messed up so they offered to take care of it with a generous compensation. Now that's customer service!!\n\nThe whole hotel is clean which is great for a semi-germaphob like myself.  Our room had a balcony featuring mountain and strip views, a full kitchen, living room, two sinks (which I feel always keeps a male and female sane when staying in the same place), a whirlpool tub, a glass stall shower, and a guest bathroom complete with glass stall shower.  Wish I had my ipod to take advantage of the ipod alarm clocks, and the crackling flamed fireplace on our pop-up tv in the bedroom for the turndown service was a great touch when we came back to the room after dinner.\n\nIt's convenient to get to the strip and MGM through the Signature Towers connecting tunnels.  It almost feels like your own secret passage way since only Signature guests can gain access to the tunnels with their room keys.  The Pool is great...relaxing and pool side food service was quick.\n\nWould definitely come again as the service was wonderful and the room was fabulous!!"
4,"Best food I've ever had from counter service. Salads are great, as as well as sandwiches. Not a restaurant by any means, but great for grab and go."
0,"I have been a patient of Dr. Burns for over ten years. I see her for my yearly women wellness check ups. Last week I saw my primary care doctor who recommended I see my OBGYN as soon as possible. I called Dr. Burns office and they wouldn't fit me into their schedule for a week. But I took solace in knowing I was seeing my doctor who has treated me for so long, I trusted her, especially since my diagnosis may require surgery. I showed up for my appointment only to be turned away, as they stated I was a half hour late and the doctor already left for the day. I showed up at the right time, I even got their voice mail confirming it! I asked to see her partner who was still in the office treating patients, and was refused! They don't see each others patients. I explained how this was an emergency. They told me I needed to go to the ER or a quick care, and the women had such a smug look on her face. I was so disgusted and tired of arguing to people who obviously do not care, so I demanded my records. Which they wouldn't provide to me for another week. I have never been so displeased with a physicians office. Especially since I work in the field, no professional courtesy, let alone they could care less about their patients. If this is the support staff that Dr. Burns wants to depend on and surround herself with then I can no longer trust or rely on her as my physician."
0,"IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT... \nDon't expect customer service! Don't expect them to answer the phone if they're busy during normal Business hours. They won't! And they won't apologize for it either! \n\nI, along with my co-workers wanted to place over 9 food orders for pick up. After several attempts to call and place our order, Wild Thaiger never picked up their phone. So I drove a few miles to place the order in person only to be told that there was a TWO-HOUR take out waiting time! I wish someone would have picked up the phone at Wild Thaiger instead of wasting my gas and time. \n\nJUST A LITTLE ADVICE Wild Thaiger, ALL your phone-in customer orders deserve the same respect and assistance as your dine-in customers! If you can't handle the heat, then get out of the kitchen! \n\nMy office and I will be taking our business to Thai Hut and Thai Basil!! Maybe that'll help alleviate some of your stress, Wild Thaiger."
2,It was okay for me nothing big they have a live band. Blankets and a swing chair you can set on really chilled atmosphere.
2,"When I go to Vegas (for fun, not work) I'm there to party. Not sit in my hotel room. Having said that, the Excalibur totally met my expectations. The room was clean, comfortable and the hotel itself was close to a lot of the attractions we were interested in (NY NY, Luxor, etc.)\n\nThere's a good selection of cheaper restaurants and the pool area is great. The location is good and all in all it was an ideal stay. \n\nI always say that in Vegas you get what you pay for - I personally choose to pay for drinks and fun as opposed to uber fancy hotels."
1,"Perhaps we had unrealistic expectations for this place, having gone to L'Avenue the day before, but boy was it bad. Service beyond slow, despite the place being only half full, latte so bad as to be un drinkable . I actually sent it back, twice and told them to forget it. Pancakes were meh, poached eggs rubbery, need I say more? When we got the check, they made a big deal of saying they didn't charge me for the latte I couldn't drink!!! Should hope not....won't be back."
1,"Vegas for a weekend getaway...great!\n\nLet's see what Mr. Wynn has for us at the City Center.. the sharp design and neon lights were breathtaking!! \n\nMy only complain is the front desk lady/check-in.  2 queen size bedroom 4 days/3 nights.  We arrived at 9pm, expecting our room to be ready.  The lady at the front desk said our room should be ready but the room is not cleaned.  Ok, she told us it should take 10-15 mins (to wait for managers approval on the cleanliness of the room before we checked in).  We can move to a 1 King bedroom , 2 queen size bed smoking room or wait.  We decided to wait.\n\nI just want to check-in, drink, party and gamble. The front desk lady was being so rude, not apologetic at all.  I asked when the last guest check out, she said 5pm.  Ok, so there is 4 hours to clean a room and it's still not finished.  She made us wait 45 minutes while she \""talks\"" with her supervisor.  Her reply, \""This happens to all of the hotels in Vegas.\"" Are you sure? We checked in at 9pm and you are still overbooked. When I stayed at Venetian and Encore there were no problems.  In fact, the check in was so smooth that I enjoyed my stay there than Aria. The lady even had the nerve to tell me to check the fine print on the website that rooms are not guaranteed. At this point I was so heated that I wanted to leave..period. I work in customer service as well, you do not cold-heartedly dismiss guests/customers like that.  At the very least you can say it is out of your control and apologize.\n\nWould I come back here? Most likely not.  The interior looks old, who decided to have dark brown as their wall panels? I felt like I was in a UPS nightmare. Hopefully other guests will have a better time checking in and if you do, do get the Strip View. \n\nChecking out is quite old school.  We thought you can check out via the TV; but not at Aria. You would need to fill out a card and drop your room keys into a box. They do need to check in the Key box before calling me and telling me that I will be billed for an extra day since I have not checked out.  I was already back home by the time they called me. I check in late and check out early to be courteous, however both times I get faulted."
3,"This is hard for me, I'm conflicted.  \nYou walk in and are greeted by a plethora of flamingos.  Nice.\nSome of the cages are like wrought iron bird cages, with bigger animals.  Not nice.  Creepy.\nFree camel rides on Sundays - at least there used to be.  Yeah, nice.\nThey have those wierd plastic melting machines that make gorillas and other fine figurines, still warm when they plop out of the machine.  Cool.\nPetting zoo/children's zoo.  Cool.\nRight next to Lake Wingra.\nI didn't see it but angry polar bears?  Scary.\nFree zoo.  FREE ZOO.  Donate money or something, they need it.  It's a pretty damn great zoo for it's size and pocketbook."
3,"The locals call it \""La Montaigne\"" and you can climb to the top for a great view of the downtown (\""centre-ville\"") high rises and bridges. Several excellent spots for taking pictures along the way.\n\nUnlike SOME Yelpers, I didn't cheat and take the bus. But let me tell you, I think I had at least three coronaries on the trails. I made the mistake that if I could climb Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, I could handle anything these overly polite Canadians could throw at me. Next time, I'll bus it!\n\nA good amount of litter here and there, which is quite disheartening. Even in the spots where there was a trashbin nearby, you couldn't make a small effort? Losers.\n\nFrom the lookouts, great views. Love it and well worth it.\n\nFrom the Mont Royal Metro station, you can ascend the mountain. Or walk up from Rue Peel where there are stairs. I came down the Peel trail which was much easier and led directly to a pub!"
0,Bought the groupon a couple months ago for 3 Supreme washes. Ended up redeeming one of the vouchers today. No attention to detail. Lint and swirls all over my paint as well as dirty water spots. Interior was still dirty in areas where they missed.

2,"I had lunch here yesterday.   While this Date cake/ caramel dessert was very good!!! My burger was just okay.... I have had better hamburgers and was a little disappointed.  It tasted more like a chuck burger and was not that good.\n\nThe warm pretzel bread appetizer was good.  THe french fries were better than the hamburger............ I thought this place was known for their burgers so that is why I got one, I ate half of it and didn't really like it that much.\n\nThis place is OKAY but not phenomenal.\n\nWait staff was attentive but sloppy.  After the pretzel appetizer they took both our knives and forks and then brought the entree and no utensils?? Had to wait about ten minutes till he came back to ask him to bring us utensils."
0,"Worst hotel ever.\n\nStayed here on 2 occasion, same problem.. NO HOT WATER..\nAnother colleague stayed here , on a different date... same problem.. NO HOT WATER\nSee another yelp review below... same problem .... NO HOT WATER\n\nIf you stay here, be prepared cos , you will likely have .. NO HOT WATER."
4,"I had to talk my husband and buddy into going to this show...And I'm soooo glad I did, it was worth every moment. It's as if you need instant replay to see all thats going on between the stage and up in the air. So colorful and the music, well I don't think you have to even be a Beatles fanatic to recognize all the amazing music. This is more dance than acrobats like the other CdS that I've seen, but I still loved it. Again I'm so glad I insisted on going, I was not disappointed and would have been for not making it while in Vegas. From the minute it starts to the finish it's a super exciting ride! Loved it!!!"
3,"Only been here a couple of times.  First time was to do a Trail Race which is a different animal in-itself.  Running single file into the woods and having people bust on their faces in the mud was a big big difference to all the road races I've done before.\n\nMost of my activities at the USNWC have just been running, but it would be neat to try biking or rafting.\n\nThe newest thing at the center is the Canopy Tour which looks pretty awesome.\n\nAfter one of my runs, we were all sweaty and decided to have a nice tall beer at the restaurant in the center.  Pretty nice way to spend an afternoon (if you survive the trails)."
4,"The best Korean restaurant (I mean barstaurant) in town. The ban chan are all so fresh. I know, it's ironic to say kimchi can be fresh since it's fermented but it's crispy and just the right amount of spicy and zest. Also had to try the sundubu and can honestly say the flavors were there. I usually go to Tofu Hut but now have a new go to place for tofu soup. The tofu was sooooo smooth it literally melted in my mouth and usually sundubu can be watered down because of the soft tofu disintegrates, but despite the softness, the tofu kept its shape and did not dilute the soup. Been wanting to come to this place for a year now and now kick myself for taking so long to actually make it. Service was also very gracious, as they took back a dish we thought was something else without a grumble.  It started getting busy and the gal handled almost all the tables. The guy could have been better, but more for her sake than ours as we were already almost done with our late dinner!"
3,Seating wait time: 15mins (Sunday afternoon)\n\nFood time after ordering: 5mins for appetizers 35-40 min for entrees. \n\nFood quality: 5 out of 5\n\nWaiter: 5 out of 5  \n\nMe and my girlfriend walked in on a Sunday afternoon before our long trip home to California. It was our first time there so we had no idea what to expect. It was a bit busy and they do not have much room for waiting. The wait time to be seated was relatively short for the amount of people there. We were able to get our drinks and appetizers really quick after ordering. The problem was the entrees taking too long. The food was really great for a chain restaurant with the enchiladas being the best I've had in a long time. The waiter was great and was keeping us up to date about our food. Overall great restaurant with good food but get four stars due to long food wait times and poor waiting area.
4,My coworker and I got to this place all the time for lunch. They make our food super fast and our food is always delicious
2,Some locals recommended this place. It was close to the bar we were creeping around and being my friends birthday we decided to go buck wild and immerse ourselves in the nightclub scene.\n\nOops! I think this club meant well but they didn't quite get it. We went around midnight and all FOUR floors were EMPTY. Why? Maybe because there is an equally bad nightclub next door that you can smoke and drink at with cheaper drinks? Or maybe because the 15 people who accumulated over our 30 minute stay were total weirdos? Not sure.
2,"Average sandwich at best. Was expecting a melt in your mouth experience kinda thing. Well, I can't say I was blown away or anything. The staff was friendly and the sandwich was delivered to my table in no time at all. It was piled high and all the ingredients within tasted fresh...the bread however was sub par. For the money, I would rather go to Pane Bianco any day...Last but not least, the complimentary chocolate chip cookie was a nice feature."
4,A lot of cool stuff. I came by to donate old uniforms and the owner gave me a new pair of boots in exchange.
0,I don't know why they call it fast lane when an oil change on a weekday can take over 3 hrs.
2,"For a store that's right in the center of Oakland, it's not very student friendly. They treated me like a criminal when I first walked in. They will strip you of your properties...like bookbags and purses. I guess I understand the paranoia since they are located in the middle of a college area where alcohol is like gold...but at least place my belongings in safe place, instead of just throwing it on the counter where some sketchy character could just swing by and then straight for the exit. \n\nThey have a good selection of wine and spirits with all the sections nicely marked, which makes looking for stuff so much quicker. Well, I kind of have to be quick to make sure nobody steals my stuff. The prices are decent and occasionally they'll have sales so you'll be able to save a few bucks. \n\nDue to the rude service and tense atmosphere, it was such an uncomfortable experience. Overall, I'm glad there's a Wine and Spirits in Oakland...it fulfills it's true purpose I guess. \n\nStay classy Pitt!"
3,"While looking on the internet for a good steakhouse in Vegas, I came across Austin's. What a find! Don't let the less than desirable locale stop you from giving this place a try. Not only is the food delicious, it's very reasonably priced. \nWhat we had -\nTo start, they bring you a basket of different types of bread. All very good but the pretzel bread was the best!\nSalad - while there were several to choose from, my husband and I split the wedge salad. It was fantastic! it was covered in crumbled bacon, chopped tomatoes and onions, blue cheese dressing and crumbles. \nMain Course - The reviews I read said to order the rib-eye so my brother and I split it (22 ounces!)  It was tender and really flavorful and worth the $36 price tag. My husband and sister in law each ordered the petite filet at $27. My sister in law said it was \""like buttah\"". \nSide Dishes - they are ALL $6 each which, if you go to any high end steakhouse on the Strip, run anywhere from $12 to $15 each. We had the creamed corn which had bits of jalapeno peppers in it, french fries, and gorgonzola mashed potatoes. All quite tasty and plenty to split between the 4 of us. \nDessert - we were there to celebrate my brother and sister in law's birthdays so they received complimentary creme brulee's, but our waiter, Shawn, mentioned that he loved the apple crisp so I ordered that and was very happy I did. It was in phyllo dough and the apples were perfectly cooked and the topping was fabulous. Probably one of the best apple crisps I've ever had ( and I've had a lot of apple crisps!) \n\nShawn also mentioned that if you go on restaurant.com, there are deals to be had for our next visit which is something I'll check out the next time I'm headed to Vegas (FYI, Restaurant.com is on Ebates.com which gives you rebates when you purchase through them so check that out!)\n\nAfter all was said and done, it was less than $50 per person for an exceptional steak dinnerl! Now THAT'S a deal!"
2,"I read the reviews on here and everyone had good things to say so we decided to try this place since it's only a few minutes up the street.  We walk in and it's a very nice simple family looking small mexican restaurant.  It wasn't very busy at all.  We got sat, and someone immediately took our drink order and brought our drinks right away, we received chips and salsa immediately and ordered a small side of quacamole (which was brought out in less then a minute) and had our dinner order taken very quickly.  Everything was fast and great so far.  We received our dinners for the 3 of us in probably 5-7 minutes.  I ordered the enchilada with mole sauce (which was VERY good), my dad ordered the seafood shrimp and crab enchiladas which was rich but very yummy.  Prices were very good too on their menu. Pretty much most of their dinners were right around the $10 range. So for everything I mentioned so far, I'd give this place 4 stars maybe even 5 stars.  But suddenly things completely changed after we received our entrees, (remember the restaurant was not busy at all that night and I think there were only 5 or so other tables dining at the same time as we were)  \n\nSo after we received our entrees NO server ever came back to the table, our glasses were completely empty, we couldn't even flag someone down til we were completely done.  We finally got a server to refill our drinks.  He then asked us if we wanted dessert. Dessert seemed a bit pricey and everything was $4.50 (almost half the price of the dinner)  So we decided to get a flan and an order of churros (you had a choice of what kind of filling you wanted too.  The choices were cream, chocolate or strawberry) So we chose the cream.  When it came out, it was a small slice of flan and 1 small churro approx 2 - 3 inches in length and a scoop of ice cream FOR $4.25 \nWHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo ok we know next time just stick with dinner and no dessert.  So again we are waiting and waiting and NO server, no anybody to come give us our check.  after 5-7 minutes we finally get our check, and we immediately give him our card to pay.  I want you to keep in mind that again this is a small place and we are sitting right next to a small wall divider by the side station where they get drinks and the open kitchen where they are picking up all the food orders.  \n\nAfter 10 minutes of waiting for our card to be returned, I finally stood up and waived to our server over the wall into the side station and motioned for her to give us our card back so we can pay and leave.  She acknowledged me and then went to the table next to us to greet them and get their drink order. She did not have our card on her and never said anything to us. After another 5 minutes we asked someone else and he finally brought it to us.  I made it very clear to him that dinner was great everything was fast and then the service was horrible and we have literally been starting at the table/wall for 15 minutes just waiting to pay and leave and that is unacceptable.  \n\nSo... 4 or 5 stars for food and the speedy service to start with 1 star for the lack of service after our food arrives for an avg of 3 stars.  \n\nWould I go back again??? YES... dinner and the prices are good, I would never order dessert again and I will not tolerate that slow of poor service after the entrees a 2nd time in a row (there was absolutely no reason for it)"
2,"The food here will feed your eyes better than your stomach. When the food gets to the table there's bound to be ooos and ahhs. But as soon as you eat a bite you'll be disappointed. Maybe even confused. How can something that looks so delicious taste so bland??? Yes the portions are big, but big portions come with big prices. The chicken and waffles can easily feed two people, so I definitely recommend sharing. Unfortunately that means only trying one item if you're not in a big party.\n\nThe wait at 2pm was estimated at 45 min to an hour, but we got seated after 20 min. If you don't feel like waiting, be sure to check the bar for self seating!"
3,"Great burgers and fries, going to try their shakes for the first time.  They also give military discount 25% best anyother fast food place.  The BBQ is the best burger ever."
1,We wouldn't go back! The food was overly priced and not very good at all! We ordered the hog burger and the fish sandwich fries and onion rings with 2 beers and it was 75 dollars! Ridiculous! Unless u have a fancy palate don't go here go to steak by Gordon Ramsey and get a good meal. The stars were for the waitress she was great
3,"This place is worth 4 stars due to the history, architecture and view. If you want a unique experience for a birthday/anniversary ect...this is the place. The restaurant on site had great service, but food was average. I'm not dying to go back for the food, but man do they have a great basil/lemon gimlet. WOW. Come here if you want to go back in time to the 30's for a nice dinner and/or drink. I will be back!"
1,"UPDATE:  12/30/06\n\nThe love affair is waning.  LGO has become overrun by pretentious annoying people accompanied by small children and little dogs.  Parking is a real problem.  I have gotten one too many plates of cold eggs.   And there seem be training issue going on at the coffee bar.  I have gotten several bad Spanish Lattes.  Very disappointing.  The counter service is also lacking - a lot of the new people working here just don't seem to care.  Ah, how I long for the good old days.  The prices here aren't exactly cheap.   I'm not sure this place is worth the bother anymore.  LGO, you are officially on probation.\n\nUPDATE:  2/9/06\n\nOkay, I love this place.  The Spanish Latte kicks ass.  And recent renovations have improved traffic flow.  It is still really busy, but understandably so.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nI want to like this place more then I do.  It has really great fresh light food.  I love the breakfast and lunch choices.  It has a definite European touch.   I love the atmosphere.  It is just too darn small and busy. There is no where to sit and no where to park.  And if you are not a \""regular\"" you don't always feel welcomed.  The concept and food gets 5 stars, but the hassle and spotty service brings it down to 3.  Nevertheless, I'm a sucker for this neighborhood hangout and I'm sure I'll be back."
1,The dinner started poorly as the hostesses could not find my reservation.  The experience was improved somewhat by the Hot Rocks small plate which included thinly sliced sirloin placed upon a heated rock to cook the meat.  Unfortunately the restaurant only provided a minimal amount of meat with the hot rock and as a growing Monkey a few slices clearly was not enough.  The 9 oz Petite Filet was uninspired at best.  If you are looking for steaks in Las Vegas then do not come here.  Mr Massie and the Light Group will need to improve this restaurant or they will continue their slide.
2,"Overall, I like Elbow Room. Food is definitely hit or miss. Here's what I've learned: Avoid any sort of seafood! There is an excellent selection of burgers and they are very customizable. The salads here are better than the average entree salad at other establishments. Desserts, made in-house from scratch, are delicious and enough for two people to split. But what keeps me coming back to Elbow Room is their late night (after 9PM) $5 martini specials. Combined with the ambiance, it's okay to feel classy. Definitely a nice getaway from most of the pubs that line Walnut."
4,"I had always enjoyed hummus but never enough to really seek out a better grade than the standard grocery store variety.  That is until I tasted the Shish Cafe's hummus.  This is a hummus you will want to eat like ice cream, it is that good.  In fact, Vegetarian Platter #2 makes it onto my Top 5 last meal list...and I'm a carnivore.  Atmosphere is non-descript strip mall, prices are moderately high, but the food is consistently spectacular."
2,"The food was overall pretty good, neat brewery decor, casual atmosphere. Service was pretty poor.\n\nWe stumbled in here for brunch because Tupelo Honey across the street had a 2 hour wait (ain't nobody got time for that)\n\nThe burgers: all incredible\n\nThe brunch food: pretty good, french toast is amazing (egg sandwich comes on a massive greasy bun, if you are into that, thats cool...I like toast)\n\nThe service: hostess was more attentive than our server was... the group I was with was really laid back so we didn't mind that all of our orders were mixed up."
1,Nice ambiance but pasta was dry and cold
1,"Have to give this two stars.. Models look nice! Spacious apartments... We almost moved in but, i was way to fearful of the broken gate because, this nice complex is surrounded by horrrible complexes and trailer parks.. Office lady needs to stop calling me... I don't want to move in after i scoped this place out at night and it wasn't pretty... Also, we found a nice house in a nice area for cheaper..."
0,"Being from So. Cal, I really missed being able to eat at Flame Broiler. But since there isn't one in town, I've been on the lookout for a good replacement. I read the reviews on Teriyaki Madness and they made it sound promising, like a good substitute. But alas, I was wrong...\n\nI was so excited to finally stop by and try the place out. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl to get a benchmark test of the place, figuring that if the standard teriyaki bowl is good, then the rest of the stuff will probably be the same quality, maybe better.\n\nEmployee behind the counter: \""Would you like brown rice with that?\""\n\nMe: \""Is there an extra charge?\""\n\nEmployee: \""Yes, 50 cents\""\n\nMe: \""No thanks\""\n\nEmployee: \""Would you like vegetables? It's a $1 extra.\""\n\nMe: \""Really!? No thanks.\""\n\nEmployee: \""Ok, your total is $7.\""\n\nSeven dollars for chicken and rice!! I could have gone to the Subway next door and gotten more and healthier food for half the price!! \n\nThen, I figured, the food must be super good quality right?  Wrong!\n\nIt wasn't anything too spectacular. The chicken was bland and fatty, but at least the rice came OK since there was a lot of it. It's no wonder they put a bottle of teriyaki sauce at each table.  \n\nOh, and I now know why they are called Teriyaki Madness... Well, if your experience is like mine, you'll leave MAD."
2,"I like Dave & Busters. It's a fun place to just hang out. I ate their food the first time the other night, and the food was just okay. I would rather either just sit at the bar and get a soda, or play games. \n\nalso, kinda weird, but my soda cost more than my boyfriend alcoholic drink.."
0,"Like some of the other reviews, I got the 5-minute haircut that was too short and could have done myself with an electric razor.  The girl that cut my hair seemed more interested in finishing my cut as quick as possible so she could disappear again to the back of the shop instead of trying to do a semi-decent job.  I asked for a neck shave, and it was 2-second scrape that only added to the total cost of the whole ordeal.  Can't recommend this place."
2,"Hotel and grounds are clean, it's right off the freeway and a couple miles from anything you need. For the price, I'm sure these things are a great value. The bad - uncomfortable furniture in the living room, bad lighting in the kitchen and also only one burner out of 2 working, small pool, a \""gym\"" that's in the lobby completely open to everyone coming and going (read: no door) - just a little unsettling if you ask me. Staff has been friendly so far too :)"
0,"Horrible service!! I LOVE donuts, but I refuse to go to this location, which is right up the street from my office, because of the horrible service. \n\nOne time I placed a bulk order in advance, the lady on the phone told me that when I go to pick it up to just wait under the sign that says \""pick up\"" *it's a big pink donut attached to the ceiling. So that is what I did and NOBODY helped me. So I had to ask for help and tell the employee that I see my order right there and I just need to pick it up! She said that I wasn't standing in line so she didn't think I needed anything!! OMG are you kidding? I am under the sign that says \""PICK UP\"".\n\nSo I tried again to just get ONE donut at around 10am. There were three employees and two just standing at the drink station. There were NO other customers there. I stood at the register just wanting to get one donut. One of the employees asked me if I wanted a drink, I said \""no\"". So she just kept standing at the drink station. Another employee asked if I wanted a drink, I said \""no\"" and so he just stood at the drink station! Are these people robots!??!? I walked out without a donut and will NEVER go back to this location, no matter how badly I want a donut.\n\nSO sad."
0,"I was at the Mall, going for dinner with a co-worker, when one the reps stopped me and talked to me about Ghost Armor and how it would protect my phone from scratches and was better than the case that I had on my blackberry at the current time.  Th rep told me that my hard case kept in dirt and Ghost Armor would not.  So, they sold me....well, after having Armor on for only one week, it was disgusting...the dirt gets caught in the corners of the \""sticky\"" sticker.  I returned to the stand, that week to show the rep, who was kind when he was selling it to me with \""a lifetime warranty\"", when I returned to show him, he offered no solution and instead told me I could pay for a new \""installation\"".  Don't buy, it's a complete waste of money and the \""lifetime\"" warranty is a total \""upsell\"" and lie.  Word of advice to the proprietor-customer service, starts at the sale, but continues with repeat customers, when you follow up on the come back!"
2,"This is a great spot for happy hour on Wednesdays. Half off martinis!! The Happy Hour food menu is awesome (HH is only till 6:30)! \n\nWe got the calamari (breaded a little too much for my taste) which has sprinkles of jalapenos and comes with two sauces. It is a huge plate for just $3 bucks! Likewise with the salmon and caper spread with pita, absolutely fantastic! \n\nThe service was pretty slow (it took 15 minutes to get our check!!!) And the bartender kept apologizing (don't apologize, just call for reinforcements numbnuts). Other than that we had a great time! Will definitely be back :-D"
1,"What a train wreck! I stopped in there for lunch at 11:15, the place was close to empty and the waiter took my order within a couple of minutes- this was the peak of the good service, or more accurately the anomaly of the terrible service. \n\nThe restaurant began to fill up and at 11:47 my chicken pita was no where to be found, after going to the counter and requesting my order to go, I only had to wait an additional 10 minutes- too bad because the food was actually really good. \n\nI just don't have that much to time to invest in a quick lunch."
4,"Definitely worth the wait. After our 1st attempt the second time was a charm. We were able to grab a seat at the bar. Our Scottish bar tender was funny, and warm. I had a lemongrass cocktail that was one of the best drinks I've had in ages. The mac and cheese with bacon and jalape\u00f1os had me literally moaning and groaning.  Great place for a date or a night our with friends."
1,As a New Yorker we have eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the city. We were looking forward to a three star experience. We had a lovely server but I was disappointed in the food. The chef tries too hard to be different and looses subtlety of food taste. Everything is with a heavy hand. I ordered the halibut but it was dry. The flavor of the fish was overpowered by the peppers and the artichoke was so overdone that all the taste was lost. We arrived at 7:30 and the restaurant was quiet enough for conversation but then it became full and I couldn't even have a conversation and asked for the bill. Too bad disappointed
3,"There were three of us. Atmosphere was great. Menu was confusing on what to share, what to do. Once we studied it, we decided that two of us would share traditional California Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll sushi to begin. These were very fresh and very good.  It was probably one of the best but not the best we have had. Then, these two would share the Shrimp and Lobster with Spicy Lemon ($38). It was served in a small deep dish skillet with veggies. It was a good size dish actually. I was afraid we were taking a risk to share, but it worked out. It was more pepper than a spicy with the lemon flavor. It was good but not over the top amazing. \n\nThe other person ordered miso soup. She liked it fine. She ordered chicken and veggie skewer ($15 ea) and white rice. She liked it well. \n\nGlass of wine ranged $15-$19 each. I had the $19 Russian river glass. It was great. Various cocktails looked fun.\n\nFinal bill was approx $60 each."
1,"Hmm the fact that you think it's ok or really didn't acknowledge that your staff asked us to stay another night in order to receive a bath is beyond my eyes!!! I do believe that dogs do suffer the amount of attention they get from your staff with the amount of dog and cat runs. It took my dogs a week to calm down and relax. I'm not looking for a place that has couches and tvs for my dogs, I mean really come on???? And when the guy brought out my dogs and I said oh are they coughing....maybe your employee should have said if anything becomes wrong with your dogs please bring them back and we'll look at them for free....just sayin if you wanted to offer that above and beyond customer service."
2,"Tried this place last Sunday, for our father's day \""cheat meal\"". I had high hopes and was strongly craving some decent mexican seafood. Upon entering we noticed that there was a guy set up in the back with a laptop and some really loud speakers DJ-ing ranchero music. I am unclear if this was because it was father's day or if this is the normal scene on weekends. Either way the music was so loud you cannot hear the waitress or each other.\n\nWe ordered a large shrimp cocktail and a shrimp quesadilla to share. Service time wasn't super quick, but we weren't in a huge hurry so this wasn't a major issue. The waitress brought us some chips and a good greenish colored salsa - I am assuming it was tomatillo based. A little while later we received our cocktail and our quesadilla. Both were ok, but the shrimp in each had the mudvain still intact. The cocktail was on the watery side but did contain a decent amount of shrimp (albeit dirty shrimp) and avocado. The quesadilla was cheesy and overstuffed. I picked out the shrimp with an obvious mudvain and continued to eat the quesadilla because it did have a good flavor.\n\nThe wait for our check was excessive and we eventually had to flag down the waitress to request the bill. I am doubtful that I will eat here again, but I have heard from friends that the other items on the menu are pretty good."
1,"Eh.....\n\nTuesday night all rolls and apps are 1/2 off\n\nThe inside of this place is great btw.  I like the decor and music and drinks... hooray.\n\nThe sushi... well.... lets just say I was happy it was 1/2 off.\n\nI would have preferred RA\n\nI found the entire place to be rather.... well.... let's just say I think it'd be a good place for a beginner sushi eater to try.\n\nTheir rolls mostly contain fake crab.... shrimp.... pretty unexciting things.  They didn't have Uni at all....\n\nTheir salmon nigiri was the smallest salmon nigiris I've EVER seen.  Like, the salmon was 1/2 an inch long.... but it did taste good.\n\nTheir appetizers were a bit disappointing.  We tried the garlic edamame, and it was weird.\nWe tried the crab puffs and they were standard iffy chinese restaurant style.\n\ni'll probably go back, just cause I live in the 'Tuke... but... Yeah, I was disappointed."
1,"Recently moved to Phoenix, and this place is in my neighborhood.  El Pollo Loco is overpriced food with very small proportions.  I spent like $10 on some quesadilla's and they came with a small packet of tortillas and mushy salsa.  I'm a skinny guy, but was still hungry after eating this. The staff at this location seemed uninterested in their jobs both times I tried out them out.  Not worth it."
1,"I wanted this to be great. I love Persian food. And the food here is really good. And I would totally eat it again, if it was not for having to go to the actual restaurant to eat. The service was so below par that it was actually hilarious. First, we were greeted and seated quickly. Which was very nice and the hostess was very polite. So far so good. Then we were told our waiter would be right with us. So we waited....\n\nand waited....\n\nwaited........\n\nfinally, my friend asked a waiter that we would like to order. But this boorish lady with a Russian accent said \""I will will get him\"". First, why do you need to get him. You were folding napkins (slowly, I might add) before we called you over. You could have taken our order and then told our waiter. Or at least, said with a nicer tone. I felt like we had just signed the death warrant for our waiter. And when she arrived, she was very pleasant and apologized for the wait. We ordered our meals and drinks. My beer and my other friend's ice tea arrived quickly. But my other friend's wine just didnt arrive. The excuse we got was \""we don't have a bartender tonight, the manager is finding it\"".  Then she left. And we never saw her again. Our appetizer arrived and our main courses. But still no wine! Finally, we got someone over here, just for them to run off to get the manager. So another guy arrives and we get the wine. By the time, he poured the glasses, he was already gone from the table. And no surprise because the wine was bad. \n\nThen as we chatted, with plates just sitting in front of us. And that Russian mob woman back to her napkins. \n\nThen the \""manager\"" arrived with our check. And told us our waitress had to leave. See what I told you?! Totally signed her death warrant with that Russian mob lady. \n\nNo apologies, no nothing. So while the food was good. I would just stay away, I mean the restaurant was half empty when we went and it was midweek. I can not imagine this place when it is busy.\n\nSo two stars because the food was great but just like how one F can ruin your GPA, the service just ruined it for us."
1,"If you're looking for a Chicago suburban banquet hall turned restaurant... This is your place! When you walk into a restaurant and the staff out numbers the patrons 2:1 you know there's a problem! They have a nice outdoor setup but if you don't go to dinner there quick, you may not get a chance to. I'm surprised they haven't closed their doors already and give this place only a few more months on life support. The food is moderately priced given the area but it's nothing to write home about. Their hummus is homemade and something you come to expect from traditional Mediterranean establishments. We ordered scallops which at some point may've tasted good. They were saut\u00e9ed and seasoned on the outside but cold on the inside. I didn't think restaurants microwaved scallops... Maybe they do? The service was so-so and the only other table in the restaurant that was occupied was next to us and had their own waiter who neglected to serve them for over 15 minutes. All in all, this isn't what I would expect for the price, service or quality of food."
2,"Beware of the \""soft opening\""!!!\nThey hotel isn't fully open yet - only partially (hence the term \""soft\"").  The decor is gorgeous, as are many of the rooms.  We saw four different rooms in our three night stay because of chaos and confusion with our reservation and with the front desk.  The kinks are FAR from out at this very new hotel.  Everyone was pleasant to the fullest, but few seemed to know what they were doing - especially when it came to using the bill and reservation systems (check in, check out and room switches all required four different people to be involved - no joke -  truly a mess).  I will likely give them a second shot, but definitely not for a few months at least.  I suggest you stay away until then also.  Oh and they really need to understand that this is Vegas in a recession, not Hong Kong in the glory days.  The prices are NUTS across the board (food, spa, drinks, amenties etc)."
3,"This is a new convenient spot for students at UNLV to get their pho or banh mi fix. Located on Maryland Parkway, it's directly across from the walkway by the Student Union.\n \nThe place is clean and service is always friendly and accommodating. I love their pho broth here. It almost has a hint of jasmine tea to it. Last time I came in I asked for a side of the broth to go with my chicken banh mi and they gave it to me, no charge. I also told him I was only going to eat the half of my sandwich there so they cut it in half for me. So awesome! Little things that matter.\n\nTheir bahn mis aren't the best I've ever had but they're cheap and good. I think I'm warming up to the bread they serve it on, which is soft and doughy instead of the usual crunchy baguettes.\n\nIf you're in the hood, I recommend this place for a nice cheap sandwich or some amazing soup. Hits the spot and is easy on the wallet."
1,"Generally, since we only had dessert, I wouldn't review Midnight Diner until I went back for a full meal. The thing is I don't see that happening.  While the decor is completely charming (a clean, bright rendition of the classic diner vibe), the hours are where it's at (all of them), and the cake that I tasted (a bite of chocolate and many bites of carrot) was rich and delicious the overall experience was soured by the service.\n\nOur waiter hovered over our booth (his only table at the post-midnight time) and kept asking if we were ready to order even though he was literally watching us still discuss what to split. Only once we decided on the brownie sundae, which he had suggested, did he tell us they were out of some of the ingredients. Maybe it's because I really hate feeling rushed or doing things twice, but by the time I ate fraction of my huge piece of cake I really had no desire to return. The food may be good, but there are other places to get good diner food in the wee hours in CLT."
0,"Not to happy after I picked up my babies. We let them board here over the weekend. We got the nail trim and courtesy bathe.\nWhen I picked them up they looked so nice and clean. But when we got home I notice they smelled like pee and there was dry poop on one of my babies back. My other baby had dry poop near his butt. I'm not even sure if they trim my dogs nails it's all filthy. \nSo I just had to give them a bath Myself. I thought about it.... I'm pretty sure this is this the last time I'm bringing them here. This is the 3rd time my Babies came out like this. I must say I back then in 2007-2011 this place was great. Now not so great. Sorry!\n\nSo apparently,  the staff that checked me out forgot to add on charges like there shots. And today, which is Sept. 4, 2014, I received a final notice of $60. But haven't received any other letter before that. But you know what! The lady that I spoke took was really professional and great about. Hope more of the staff's would be like her."
0,"If I could give this place any less of a star I would do so. So biggest thing to make this place not worth the land it is built on is that they  first, GAVE ALL MY INFO AND MY ROOM BILLING INFO for both of the rooms that I had booked under my name only to another person. This in turn caused huge issues in our group, we actually had a huge blow up in the lobby due to this. Second, they allowed another person in our group to go and check into a room that I was told was not ready to be checked into WITHOUT ME BEING PRESENT and WITHOUT ME EVEN BEING AT THE PROPRTY. Now I don't think I am an expert on privacy laws or occupancy and identification requirements, but I believe that this is something that is illegal or against the law, not to mention I would also think this would be against hotel policy. I am actually getting legal counseling for this and am looking into what I can do about a situation like this. ANYONE OUT THERE CONTACT me if you have any info you can share.\n\nLet's get to the hotel. Bathroom doors were broken, out of the 3 rooms we had 1 had a fridge, power plug to the desktop computer area didn't work(which is not a big deal just have to mention it all), and how in the world can you have a hotel now a days that doesn't have an ipod hook up(either to the tv or clock radio) to play music. Also we asked for 2 glasses to the room to use for drinks and they charged me $10 to use an extra pair of glasses. This the first time I have ever had a hotel charge me to use some of their glasses. I could have gone and played cheap slots and ordered free drinks that would come with a glass. \n\nNow to the pool. When I walked out to the pool it was nice to see all the space that it had. But then I kept walking looking for some pools to go into. And kept looking and low and behold finally found their pools. When I saw how small and horribly bad these pools were I thought I would kill myself. But after looking at how packed and disgusting the water was in the pool I figured if I want to do that I might as well get in because that disease filled pool could do it for me. This is definitely one of the, if not the worst pool I have ever seen.\n\nI can keep going on more and more but my hands are tired and I don't want to waste any more of my time at the moment. If you want to know more get in touch with me"
2,"My first visit to the Lost Leaf was last Friday during First Friday and we didn't stay for even 10 minutes because it was so packed. Last night, after lots of peer pressure, I ventured over there again. It was a lot more mellow then. We had a good group of people and grabbed a REALLY high top table. The Lost Leaf carries a lot of different beers!  Alas it was a school night so I could not partake of it too much.I can't wait to go back and try a bunch of them!\n\nI can't wait to return to Lost Leaf and increase their rating. For now I'll leave it at 3, I was only there for about an hour. I think if you just want to chill with some friends, drink some interesting beers and chat the night away, this is a GREAT spot to do it!"
3,"Since I discovered Tasty Thai back in Dec, it has become one of my favorite lunch spots, have even convinced coworkers and my boss to try it, I have to say my very fav is the masaman curry, thai hot, for me that's perfect! But I stepped outside of my normal lunch dish today and ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with chicken, thai hot and omg that too was delish! Everyone ordered different dishes and everything looked soo good, Im going to have to work my way around the lunch menu soon lol so I thought I should update my review! Still a great place for a fast lunch that isn't a big dent in your wallet!"
0,I've come here often and always had good food and service. Except for today. My order was wrong. No big deal I walk up they offer to fix it I say ok. 15 minutes later no food. I walk up again and the guy asked if I had received my food. I said no so he went and had them make it again. They did. I get back to my table and the food is wrong again. Then when I walk back up the girl tells me I asked for different hotdogs. I asked for what I ordered and what was on my receipt. No one apologized. I got frustrated and walked to the cashier and asked for my money back. I said I'd pay for the burger and fries my girlfriend ate but not the hotdogs. \n\nWhat made me mad was no manager took responsibility or tried to make it right. All I got was grief from the employees for their mistakes. Sad to say but I'll never go back.
1,"ok prices, barely ok food, works in a pinch."
0,"Very disappointed with our recent stay. We are frequent guests at this hotel's stay here several times a year.  The last time we were here we were not charged a resort fee.  Today we went to use our 2 for 1 Buffet but we were advised we needed the coupon we get from check in. The buffet cashier told us to inquire with the front desk.  We go to the front desk the guy said we did not pay a resort fee.  When we checked in the attendant at the front desk told us the resort fee is waived and did not charge us the fee.  The person at the desk told us (in a rude manner) there's a difference between the fee being waived and comped. We told him that we were not given a choice when we checked in the attendant told us the fee will be waived (we assumed they weren't charging it to us since we are frequent guests). Bottom line's attendant was rude.  The front desk was not clear with things.  Very dissatisfied with this last stay. We will not be staying at this hotel anymore. \n\nLastly the valet has been horrible the past 4 days. Is it too much to ask to open the passenger door?  Every hotel we have every been to in Vegas,  the valet attendants have always opened the passengers door.  Mind you the valet wasn't busy during our stay (during the weekdays it's kind of slow... plenty of times we were the only ones waiting in the valet). Last night the valet phone was ringing over 5 minutes and there was no one at the valet desk. \n\nDo yourself a favor and stay at one of the many other resorts near by."
4,"Love, love, love this store (both Arcadia and Uptown). I really don't know how it could be any more perfect!  The other ladies have already covered the goodies so I'll keep it short (ish).\n\nI love the awesome ladies who work there. I love Thursdays at Arcadia where you can have wine with your shopping experience. I love the handmade jewelry. I love the great prices on these upscale finds. I love that they post photos of outfits on FB cause that's usually what gets me off my butt and over there shopping. I love that local charities benefit from your purchases. I love the constant sales.\n\nIf you love deals and supporting local biz, \""Like\"" them on FB and get over there A.S.A.P. and revel at how much you get for the money! Major Score, ladies!"
2,"I truly wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. I love the concept of this restaurant. I spoke with the chef/owner's husband who was our server and he mentioned that they have a few other Fresh Mint restaurants, one of which is in Hawaii. I ordered the cucumber rolls (appetizer) and my bf ordered the pho. It took an exceptionally long time to get our food after lunch rush hour. While I appreciate that everything is made when you order it... An hour seems like an aweful long time to wait for julienned veggies wrapped in raw cucumber with a side of peanut sauce. The pho followed a few moments later. I liked it but my compadres felt it was less than authentic. Bottom line... Go here if you are in the mood for healthy fair that's vegan friendly and you're not in a rush!"
4,"If you're hungover, high, both, or a just plain fatass like myself... this place is perfect for you!!!  \n\nLet's just say dirty south, everything is fried, portion sizes are always big enough for 2 or even 3 people.\n\nSee my pix. Fried Chicken bennie. yes please!"
3,Great find. This place is legit. Love the texture of the noodles and perfectly cooked hard boiled egg. Nothing over $9.50 on the entire menu. Limited seating but worth the wait.
4,"My Fianc\u00e8 brought me to The Treasure Island for the weekend and surprised me with show tickets. The Myst\u00e8re had jaw dropping acrobatics, breath taking stunts. Increadible strength and endurance from beginning to end . Great theatrical costumes and music. Liked the assigned seating, all seats are pretty good. Hilarious pre-show performer, cracking jokes on the audience. Best show in Vegas so far!"
3,"Had read good reviews about this creperie so decided to stop in for a late night snack/dessert as I was walking through Old Montreal on a recent trip. Ordered the lobster bisque w/cognac which was amazing, and their La Laurentienne crepe (ham, Swiss cheese, asparagus, w/bechamel sauce). Absolutely delicious. \n\nRestaurant itself was nice and cozy with available upstairs seating. Very affordable. Highly recommended."
4,"I took the kids here one random weekday for their petting zoo and had a blast! They're a dairy farm (be prepared to be breathing in that fresh country air!) and do tours at 10am and 12noon which would be cool to check the place out but maybe another day...they had a good selection of animals-(all baby animals) horses, cows, sheep, goats, chickens, bunnies, and they actually took the small ones out of their cages so the kids could actually hold and pet them. \n\nPerks...\n\nThey have horseback riding lessons for kids (there was a class going on while we were there so we were able to watch a little). \n\nThey have AMAZING, fresh cheese curds (I'm from WI so this is HUGE!!) which I snagged a couple different flavors-the jalepeno is amazing and barely lasted the car ride home! \n\nThey make their own ice cream from their own milk and have a freezer full of different AMAZING flavors!!! We tried three different kinds and all were delicious! \n\nThe animals were surprisingly clean and appeared to be well taken care of.\n\nThey were filming a Chick-fil-a commercial the day we went so we got pictures with the Chick-fil-a cow mascot!  \n\nSome downsides...\n\nThey're kind of a far drive even from Chandler (they're east of Sossoman and Elliot) but after going, I'd say it's worth it! \n\nPetting Zoo hours are a little weird given that naptime usually falls right in the middle of the day... Tuesday-Friday-12:00-3:00pm, Saturdays-1:00pm-3:00pm, Sundays- 10:00am-3:00pm...\n\n~~~~~\n\nI just checked out their website and they're doing a MOO-ey Christmas three Friday nights in December from 5-10pm (Santa's gonna be there!!) for $5 which includes face painting, petting zoo, night time hayride, and s'mores!! We will DEFINITELY be there!!"
1,"Food is good, no complaints.... But I can't help but feel like Rao's is an upscale Old Spaghetti Factory. Rao's is a stereotypical Americanized Italian restaurant with above average quality and higher-end pricing.\n\nItalian restaurant menus typically stay consistent and Rao's stays within the typical trattoria mold. Nothing exciting... just the classics. \n\nIn the end, I'd much rather go to Scarpetta @ Cosmo, Otto or B&B @ Venetian, or Fiamma @ MGM."
3,"It was nice as usual, with one exception: they didn't allow ANY PURSES or bags unless they are clear, yet there were no signs or information warning about this until you got to the doors. A bit of a pisser for A LOT of people."
0,I was drunk and didn't like it .... think about it hahaha its bad...plus its expensive and like the coffee shop the lack of service is worse than your rude asian eateries
0,Red lobster was not the place to be tonight. Saturday-8/11!!!! The service was horrible. The waiter messed up so bad that we had more free food then we ordered. The appetizer came out after the salad. It seem to be over before it started. It only went down hill from here. I am done with this location. Come on red lobster!!!
4,"yummy !!\n\nGreat customer service (especially from the guy that took my order in the drive thru)\n\nAnd vegetarian options !!!! yay !!!\n\nfast, good, hot food !!! \n\nwill go back"
0,"Terrible. We went for first time today and had top 5 worst meals we have ever had. Mussels smelled very fishy and like cat litter; ordered steak and frites, medium well.. Came out bloody and 50% fatty... Sent back and it was bloody again. After all that they still charged us $49 for drinks and smelly mussels. We will not be back. Terrible."
0,"Smoking? Really. I guess a way to get around what the voters voted for is to post a sign saying 21 and over. I asked the mgr why they allowed it and he had no answer. But he did say they have a great ventilation system. But we still smelled smoke. It's too bad, it has good food but I'm not asking for a side of cancer."
3,"Awesome place.  Very delicious Thai food.  I got the green curry with chicken. I was impressed because the curry was thick and full of flavor. It had the consistency of a stew.  The spice was good.  I probably could have gotten a 4 out of 5 on the spice level,  but I was happy with the 3. The chicken was all breast meat as usual in the states. It was cooked just to tender and not overdone. They also had large chunks of eggplant. Unfortunately,  they used peas and carrots so it made it feel a little americanized. Otherwise,  I liked the place and would recommend to anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant."
2,"My boyfriend saw this place on Man Vs. Food and it is only about a 5 minute drive from the strip. \n\nNot bad. We arrived at 12:30PM ready for seafood. Yet, we were seated, given menus, then as we attempted to order we were informed that they are not currently serving crawfish. The item they are known for! UNACCEPTABLE! We came here for the crawfish, thats what we wanted, so why would we order something else. The waitress expanded that they just received a shipment so their crawfish are frozen. First off, hearing frozen was a huge turn off. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area so our seafood here is FRESH. Yet I had to remind myself that Vegas is in the desert so fresh seafood here is unlikely. \n\nWe rolled our eyes and blew the joint. I swear I would be back but for the rest of the day I was getting puppy eyes from the honey so I agreed to give them a second try and attempt dinner.\n\nWe arrived again at 5:30 and we were seated after 10 minutes. We ordered a pound of Hot & Juicy Special in Medium and one pound of shrimp in Garlic Butter medium and a side of sweet potato fries. First off there is not one positive thing that I can recall about the fries so I would recommend ordering a bowl of rice instead. Yes, order rice over fries. I never thought I would recommend that to anyone. Ever.\n\nMy favorite flavor was the Hot & Juicy! It was packed with flavor and mighty tasty! The Garlic Butter was good too! I would both order them again. The heat levels here though are a little off, if you want hot, order medium, etc. I would beware the extra spicy! \n\nThe place got pretty crowed around 6:20 and I was happy we arrived fairly early. The service here is lagging. You have to notify your waiter(ess) if you want more water. They don't really pay attention the details. \n\nI would go back if I lived there and needed a crawfish fix, but on my next Vegas trip or any after I will not be visiting Hot and Juicy. It was good, but it wasn't THAT good. \n\n(I took off a star for not having crawfish when I went initially FYI)\n\nOH and yes, my paws smelled 2 days after. The amount of soap didn't matter. The order sinks in! Kinda yucky.\n\nHappy ripping off the heads of crawfish! \n\n(="
1,"Little did we know that going through Expedia.com for hotel reservations is actually a 'request' and not a reservation, so we ended up getting stuck with two double beds, on our honeymoon no less!  I understand that the hotel was booked but we asked three staff members and the y barely apologized, let alone offered any appeasement seeing as that we were on our honeymoon! We even brought it to the attention of management and got no where.\nI guess we won't be going back here and it's too bad because the service was otherwise great."
3,"I'm not a KISS fan. I know Gene Simmons, that's it. I know one KISS song. All of that doesn't matter - this place is great mini-golf fun!\n\nI want to give this place FIVE STARS because of how great the staff is.  Every one there was fun, energetic and genuinely seemed to be having a great time hanging out there and getting people set up to have fun. That fun is infectious and it really set the tone for a great visit.\n\nThe golf course was fun to play.  A few holes offered a challenge but a few felt pretty rewarding. If things could be better, it'd be nice if things were a bit more interactive. Also, one of the holes runs close to a Fire Exit and the relentless Vegas sunlight creeping in near the creases kinda takes away from the otherwise excellent blacklight environment. Also, it'd be great if there were podiums to use near every hole - a place to put down your beer and take score.\n\nThe arcade machine selection was just alright. Lots of interactive machines. If you're coming here expecting a full arcade with pinball and Mortal Kombat, temper your expectations because it's not here. They had ride-on games like Batman, Fast and Furious and big ticket-dispensing games like Deal or No Deal. They've got the classics like Whack-A-Gator and the strength tester but the NFL Football Toss was underlit, the balls under inflated and was probably the most disappointed game there - mostly because I suck as a QB, tho.\n\nOverall - if you're jonesing for Mini-Golf while in Vegas - this was fun."
2,"Go there to grab a drink but skip the food, much better choices to feed yourself in the area.\nI you think of Madison's as a bar you'll be fine: friendly staff, good choices of beer on tap, plenty of TVs to watch local sports."
3,"The crispy, juicy fried chicken that I ordered was perfection! It took quite a bit of a wait and I was super hungry at the time, but once I got my food I forgot all about the hunger and just dove in. The service was great. I happen to visit on a busy day (even though it was around 2pm) but there was no problem tending to my needs. I also ordered their chicken wings to go. Their almond pudding with lychee was a refreshing break from the oily food I just consumed. \n\nI don't know if they changed the minimum amount of $10 for those paying with a card, but I honestly find it inconvenient for me since I never carry cash and use my debit to pay for everything. So I was somewhat \""forced\"" to order more that I wanted. *shrugs* I guess I shouldn't be surprised since most places have that $10 minimum =/\n\nOther than that, this place is great. Everything was affordable, which is a good thing for a college student like myself."
4,"Like Julia, I tend not to tire of referring to Cock-Burn street by it's phonetic pronunciation, which sounds slightly like the kind of ailment you'd find after getting a bit carried away down Lothian Road. It's one of the streets I know best in Edinburgh, but a trip up is always tinged with sadness as I remember Fopp and Uber-Disko, two of the best DJ and vinyl shops around, which have sadly now made way for a drugs information clinic and whatever is currently a couple of doors down from Avalanche. I forget.\n\nRetail has to move with the times however, and while I do miss my old favourites, I'm glad to see that it's quirky and oddball stores such as Cutie House and Supa Kuru that have came in to brighten up the place rather than the usual soulless dross.\n\nFantastic ice-cream at Toddle Inn as well, and in Underground Solu'shn, at least one store is keeping the \""crisp biscuits\"" alive."
2,Nice atmosphere and the frites were great but we expected the meals to be more flavorful and we found the drinks to be overpriced. More welcoming to kids than many similar restautants.
2,"They were very helpful in here.  I went in needing an oil and air filter for my car.  They didn't have them in stock, but were more than glad to order them from their warehouse for me, and they arrived within 24 hours.  Their prices are just a bit more expensive when compared to Auto Zone.  You'll find a few items in here that may be priced the same or a dollar or two cheaper, but for the most part there are priced just a hair about AZ. \n\nThe staff was all very nice...knowledgeable and helpful.  Also for those with brake rotor problems, they will turn your rotors here as long as there is enough left for them to safely be turned.  And they'll do it for only $15 a pair.  That's a lot cheaper than most any mechanic shop you'll find!"
0,"They overcharge big time for the oyster omelette and skimped on the ingredient. I counted two partial slivers of very stale oysters, which left a really bad taste at $8-9 a dish. I also ordered a fried chicken rice plate, which was probably the most dry, flavorless fried chicken steak I've ever had."
4,"I love this place because it is healthy, quick, and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. There is a register to pick up phone in orders and a takeout order usually is ready within 15 minutes. It is one of the healthiest places around and sure does beat fast food. The menu options are really great too."
2,"Stopped in Sunday afternoon for a bite. Ambiance is nice and simple. Service was prompt and friendly. \n\nI had the smoked chicken sandwich. The chicken was pulled and smoky. It had flavor that made me go \""mmhmm\"" out loud. It was very lightly sauced so next time I will ask for extra. The bun was a biscuit that felt a little undercooked so next time I will ask for it toasted. \n\nAlso in the to go container was beautiful French fries with rock salt on them, a side salad, and some pickled vegetables. A side of a vinegar/mustard dressing was buried under the salad so I didn't see it until if finished the lettuce. \n\nThey didn't hand me napkins, plastics ware, or a bag but perhaps I missed some of those. All for about $10. \n\nHad to wait for them to make the dish (about 10 minutes) so don't expect to pop in and out. And they do not have a diet soda option but water is free. \n\nThe food has a lot of potential as the main focus (chicken) was very tasty and only some of the elements of the meal needed tweaking which should be easy to do since the workers are friendly. I would like to have more direction for napkins and utensils (especially for to go orders like mine) and a diet soda option. \n\nI will be going back but for now it gets a 3/5"
0,"Absolutely the worst car rental experience ever. If you looking for an awful\nway to begin your Las Vegas vacation try renting from Dollar the the\nMcCarren Airport. The rental agent was extremely rude and aggressive in\npushing their additional liability insurance, which we tried to refuse several times. When my daugher intervened and told the agent \""he told\nyou three times that wed did not want additional coverage\"", the agent told her it was none of her blusiness and if we didn't  like it we could go to another conpany (which we would have if we had not already given them our credit card and drivers license) At this point we asked for the manager on duty (not a significant improvement) and completed our\ntransaction."
0,"I should have listened to Lon L.  \nOut of all the Yelpers on Yelp, I respect Lon's reviews the most. I usually agree with his opinions about 99.9999% of the time, but due to the fact that this is the only Fry's in Clark County, I stupidly didn't listen to his review this time. Even Jaime W, wrote a 1-star on this place, but I didn't listen. What was I thinking? \n\nI couldn''t figure out how the get any service here.  The workers just stand around and talk about random stupid things with each other.  Once in a while they will help a customer but it's usually one of those bleached blonde chicks in short-shorts.  If you are a dude or a woman of integrity you probably won't get any service.  When I finally was able to find a worker, he was really groggy and looked like he had been sleeping in a cardboard box in the back.  I told him that I wanted to buy  the TV that was on sale, and it literally took him 15 minutes to tell me that it was sold out. I think afterwards, he went back into the back room and went back to sleep. \n\nThe workers here are the same d-bags that hang out at the Encore on Saturday nights and  tell all the club chicks that they are millionaires. One of my best friends is the poker room supervisor at the South Point, so I visit him occasionally when I have time. While visiting, I always noticed this attention seeking guy who keeps telling everyone that he is a \""pro poker player\"". Well, this self-proclaimed pro poker player was working at the floor here at Fry's. \n\nIronically, I ran into Bobby Y.(Misty's husband) a few days ago and he was a little concerned about my safety, due to the fact that I have been getting frequent death threats from business owners, human resource directors, and angry yelpers. He gave me some advice on how to be more \""nice\"" and \""positive\"". So, I won't go on one of my typical profanity filled rants this time. I'll just end by saying that I should have listened to Lon L and Jaime W."
3,"A lot of variety. Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese. Their menus are thick. Average about $5.95 - $7.95 for lunch. They like to hide their lunch menu. So you need to ask for it if they don't give it to you. \n\nGood portions for lunch specials. Free soup and dessert even for lunch. But again, sometimes you have to ask for it. In my opinion, best deals for the lunch is their pan fried fish. \n\nCredit card only over $20. But they are pretty flexible about it."
1,"With the caveat that I didn't have a burger the two times I was here (but tried a number of apps and shakes), this place is typical for an eatery at a big Vegas hotel - adequate, never a bad meal, but you will never be blown away in any fashion (my humble person opinion - every meal in Vegas at a high end hotel is basically just a facsimile of the better version you can get at the restaurant's SoCal or NY location).\n\nI came here twice on a recent bachelor party.  Once for milkshakes, and once for apps before our flight home.  The (boozy) milkshakes were very good.  I had the \""Fat Boy\"" (UV Candy Bar Vodka, Reese's, Pretzels, Sprinkles, Chocolate-Caramel Popcorn).  A friend had the Vegan Maple Pecan shake (Almond Milk 'ice Cream', Jack Daniel's, Spiced Pecans, Maple Caramel Sauce).  Both were delicious, although if you are really in the mood for something sweet and creamy, the vegan shake probably won't hit the spot (the sort of \""earthy\"" taste of the maple and almonds doesn't give you the same satisfaction as real ice cream).  The booze was barely detectable, however (I would've liked at least just a little taste, to know I was drinking something alcoholic).\n\nThe next day we came back for onion rings, chicken fingers, buffalo chicken dip, and surf and turf quesadillas.  I had a bloody Mary, which was good, but after three days of drinking, the shrimp on top was NOT appetizing.  The apps were all meh - not bad, but not great.  I was expecting something more from the \""Southern fried\"" chicken fingers, but they basically tasted like something I could get from Roy Rogers.  Dip was good, but again, didn't really taste fresh made or have that \""pop\"" I was expecting when I read the menu description.\n\nWe sat in the front every time we came here, so I can't comment on the rear seating area, but I will say this - there is incredibly loud music with a heavy bass beat that is just not palatable.  \n\nAll told, try the shakes.  Maybe try the burgers (can't comment directly, but I wouldn't be optimistic based on the other food).  Apps are basically TGI Friday's quality."
2,"our luck was not as good as other,  service was just okay i can say it better then a good buffet so was there food!!  the prime rib was not cook to expectation  \ni don't think i want to try then again \ngood luck"
3,"I grew up in NY and I still think our bagels are the best. But the best bagel I've had outside of NY is definitely here! So soft and delicious, the best bagels in Montreal!"
0,Didn't give me a straw. Didn't put the lime in the fish tacos. The fish missed the tortilla and was sticking out a whole out the side of the aluminum foil The cabbage missed the tortilla. No lemon in my ice tea. I love Del taco but these folks are not paying attention
3,"Love restaurants that have this sports atmosphere - plenty of pix, artifacts, autographs and memorabilia.  Food was very good, as was the service.  Prices were reasonable.  We'll go back on next visit to Scottsdale."
0,The food was terrible!! I ordered the fried chicken salad and made it into a  wrap to go .. the kitchen did not cut it properly so when I received my wrap all the salad fell apart .. the fried chicken was burnt and hard so I had to pick all of that out of my wrap.  But the salad was so dry and bland that I just tossed the wrap .. decided to just eat my fries but found out the fries were undercooked .. yay for a terrible lunch on my break : maybe they need a few more weeks to get everything settled .. but I don't know if I will take that chance .. staff was a bit clueless this time so at least in a few weeks service will be better. hopefully.
0,First time here- I ask for a beergarita & receive a Blue Moon draft with margarita mix and tequila. BLEGH! And it was $9 to boot. I drank half and couldn't finish the rest. The bartender was some unattentive guy who kept twirling the bar shaker around. It was a terrible experience & I'll never return!
4,"This lovely and relatively new hotel & resort in Las Vegas is first rate! Vinny and I stayed there this summer during a quick jaunt to Vegas and really enjoyed the hotel and all of its amenities. When we first checked in, we didn't expect we'd have a good experience because right off the bat we had to wait in a 45-minute line to check in, and then, the hotel screwed up and didn't have our reservation correct. Fortunately, the folks at the Cosmopolitan more than made up for it by giving us an updated room free of charge-- and, I must say, the room was amazing!! It was a large 1 bedroom suite w/ a balcony overlooking the Bellagio hotel and fountain (yes, the very one where they do the daily fountain and light show-- what a view, I tell ya)! Plus the room had a large sunken tub and walk-in shower, a large living room seating area, and high-tech work space (yep, sadly, I had to do a little work on the trip even though we were mostly there for vacation, but the work space turned out to be a godsend for me). \n\nOther great features of the Cosmopolitan include their casino (it's modern looking and packed with lots of high rollers and beautiful people), their abundance of restaurants and shops, and their large pool recreation area, which features a couple of outdoor bars and plenty of lounge chairs for relaxing. \n\nNote that one of my favorite things about the Cosmopolitan, believe it or  not, is their Pizza restaurant. Check out my review of the Pizzeria @ The Cosmopolitan. Some of the best pizza I've ever had!!"
0,"Trashy.  Like a giant ghetto dollar store.  poor quality products, sketchy environment, dirty.  Not to mention the drunk elvis impersonator.  This is not a \""swap meet\"" and I'm sorry I wasted my time!"
4,"I'd heard so many great things about The Bronze Cafe, I had high expectations for my first visit. I was not disappointed. \n\nEach of the fresh water/juices I sampled was delicious as refreshing. I choose the watermelon with chia seeds - healthy and tasty. For my lunch I had the Good Earth pita sandwich - again, healthy, very tasty, and filling. For dessert (I had to) the matcha green tea vegan cheesecake was flavorful, lighter than regular cheesecake, and not too sweet. \n\nI would gladly eat here regularly."
1,"We went to this buffet with some friends because we had the complimentary voucher. We upgraded to the unlimited mimosas for a few bucks more, which we were happy to pay. \n\nOverall, the food was alright. We were there for the brunch and they had the standard breakfast food, but it was just plain, no real pizazz.\n\nHowever, our server was awful. Yes, we like mimosas. And yes, we like many of them. So please, sir, don't give us a dirty look when we order another round. Seriously, he would be nowhere to be found for long stretches of a time, so when he came to our table, we were ready for more mimosas. And he seriously gave us a dirty look when we asked for another round. He was really rude.\n\nOverall, it was just meh. Last year, we had brunch at the Bellagio. Next time, we'll probably do the same. The extra cash is worth it."
2,"My husband and I went to this theater the other night to see the Mamma Mia sing-along premiere (the movie was cheesy, but I love ABBA and had a blast singing along!). We appreciated how friendly the staff was and how clean the facilities were. The food options were also good (they had White Castle cheeseburgers!), although they didn't have those self-serve candy bins, which I love and usually see at larger theatres. I have to complain for a minute about the seats, though. In my opinion, a huge part of the theater experience is how comfortable the seats are, and these ones just didn't cut it. I found myself constantly readjusting my position to try to get comfortable but didn't have much luck. A lot of newer theatres make comfortable seating a big focus, but I guess Harkins didn't get the memo. All in all, a decent theater, but I wouldn't make the drive from South Phoenix when there are two or three perfectly decent theaters that are closer."
3,"I've given this place several tries since they opened, and it looks like they invested a lot into renovating the new place.  They made some adjustments the first couple weeks, and now they are a great option I would recommend.\n\nPros:\nNice construction, decor and GREAT music.\nFriendly sushi chef and manager\nSushi had very elaborate plate presentation\n\nCons:\nPrices a bit high, but the quality is there to back it up.  (except a couple items)\nService is a little scarce once you get your food, but it seems like they're working on improving that.\nPurchased the 10-piece sashimi, but only got 9 pieces. \n\nConclusion:\nTsuki looks nice and has potential. I highly encourage others to try it out."
2,"I am fortunate to a number of great sushi places around where I live and 808 is definately one of them.  Not to say it's the best or worst but it is definately solid.  I actually like their apps, all their fried offerings are really good, and if you stop by you should give them a try.  The service is usually good as well, since it is a small place you have to expect that though.  There isn't really anything that jumps out at me though and that's why I have to give it 3 stars.  If there was I would bump it up a star but it is a very solid 3 stars for this place"
2,Had the wings here for the first time and it was amazing. The house salad was great like always. Except I tried the new filet and shrimp dish with mash potatoes as the side and was not impressed with it at all. The filet was bland and the mash potatoes had some raw pieces in it.
3,"I love this place and so do my clients and colleagues who are downtown.  They never hesitate when I book a lunch meeting here.  There are so many interesting items on the menu, but my favorite is the Chef's Trio.  The last visit, this is what was on the Trio:\n\nChef Trio (Beef Soup, Potato Salad w/Bacon, Veggie Calzone), $10\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=g6iPj5WpOU-IUMDzdGwXTw#g6iPj5WpOU-IUMDzdGwXTw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=q-jiqBVGITDHYrfW2nwkhQ#q-jiqBVGITDHYrfW2nwkhQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=BJBGLXK8LcaZtear6hwTOQ#BJBGLXK8LcaZtear6hwTOQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=4E90w9JyCNDGIJ2szOhhtg#4E90w9JyCNDGIJ2szOhhtg\n\nI started with the Beef Soup, which was simply AMAZING!  The Beef was of high quality and full of flavor.  Just the right portion size too.  Next I had the Veggie Calzone....I have to admit, I was a little skeptical of that part of the dish, but they delivered....it was awesome.  The best part of the dish though was the Potato Salad w/Bacon.....that's right folks, it has BACON in it!!!  It tastes as good as it sounds.  The Bacon does not overwhelm the flavor of the Potato Salad, it compliments it.  It also has very sharp flavors and rounds out the trio dish well.  Well done chef, well done!\n\nI can't wait until our next lunch downtown!\n\nReturn Factor - 95%"
0,"I was a volunteer driver for two years for URRKN.  They are a nonprofit 501c (3) organization run by Tina LaBlanc and her husband.  I was very excited to be a member with all these cat lovers taking cats to their forever homes.  Unfortunately, there is a dark side to URRKN.  Tina LaBlanc was asking members to donate to various causes that covered personal, not URRKN related, expenses for Tina and other Administrators only.  From trips, vacations, car repairs and clothing to house upgrades.  All members, including management, are volunteers and provide their time free of reimbursement.  URRKN is not a rescue, foster, or other pet related organization.  It is a transportation group only.  Moving cats from point A to point B, all free of charge.  Any expenses for the cat is absorbed by the adopter and adoptee.\nIt was also brought to my attention that transports were based on how big a donation you made to URRKN, not the first come first serve basis we all thought.  Some transports were taking up to 5 months to organize.  Others in two weeks.\nJust recently, a You Caring request for $3000 in funds was posted on the members page requesting donations to fix a administrators car.  At this time, no administrator is taking a salary or being reimbursed for expenses.  I questioned these donations and was banned from commenting.  I since realized that URRKN was violating 501c(3) nonprofit operation rules and found another group to drive for who is totally transparent.\nBefore you join or donate, please research this organization.  Do not be taken advantage of like I was."
2,"Popped in again tonight.\n\nSticking with 3 stars.\n\nCheese crisp is smaller than it used to be. Frozen house margarita downright sucked but blue margarita which cost an extra buck was a lot better.\n\nBaja verde enchiladas were good. Baja sauce is ok but could be better. Rice was good, service was good and kids cheeseburger was good.\n\nSticking with the 3 stars based on it being a classic valley staple. A little overpriced on some things and exceeding in other areas. This place can really be hit or miss though."
4,"if you've grown up eating japanese food this place will bring back great memories! every thing is delicious and the restaurant is very comfortable. don't get rolls! instead treat yourself to some real japanese food, sashimi. ask the chef for what's good, trust him he does it for a living."
1,"Eh, I guess I'm not that impressed. Service was non-existent if borderline awful. I absolutely hate when I am the first to say hello or make eye contact. Chalk it up to working for both Mickey Mouse and Steve Wynn--or maybe just chalk it up to being a good person. \n\nThe free cookies with Yelp check in were...weird. They tasted like they had an inordinate amount of Crisco or some weird oily crap in each bite. They left a weird coating in my mouth and did not entice me to come back. The cannoli were alright, but again somehow weirdly mouth-coating.\n\nWith all the other sweet treats around LV I can't say I'll be back...I'm not sure what all the fuss is about."
4,"I came here to get a dress hemmed and was very pleased with the results.  The seamstress did a great job of helping me decide what length to make the dress and was very friendly.  On top of that, the dress was ready in 2 days and only cost $15!  I will definitely be going back for all my tailoring needs."
2,"Very fun original cafe. Excellent iced tea and organized counter service. Veggie flatbread was a bit flat (!) for me with a heavy tomatoe sauce.  (It has been eaten up as leftovers in our home, hmm.) Flatbreads can be so flavorful with an olive oil rather than pizza sauce...yep, that's a preference.  Desserts appeared a bit ordinary to me. Admittedly, that may be the appeal here.  I promise to revisit to expand my tastings."
4,"Free Vegas Club Passes is the ONLY way to do Vegas! I was skeptical at first, but Chris and his service is amazing... he set up our itinerary and everything was a go from there. We were in Vegas January 11-13, 2013. We were looking for a more Hip Hop atmosphere so we went to LAX at Luxor Friday night and Tryst at The Wynn on Saturday night (which was absolutely fabulous and Jermaine Dupri was the guest DJ)!!!  If you're not a big Hip Hop fan... don't be alarmed by these clubs because they play a mix of everything. If you are a fan of Hip Hop I think this is how most of the clubs in Vegas operate (Hip Hop, Top 40, House, etc.- there's a nice blend) so don't expect 100% anything-- it also probably depends on the DJ. I will say that when they say arrive between 10:30 and midnight -- you probably want to get there at 10:30 because you can literally walk away and there's no one in line and 5 minutes later there will be a mass of people. However, we had no problems getting in... the lines for the guest/VIP entry list moved fairly quickly. Chris responds to texts and is awesome. This is a great, hassle-free, worry-free service, especially for larger groups. This is also ideal, for guys traveling with women... you get great discounts versus what you'd pay at the door without the service. I will definitely recommend and use this service on my next Vegas trip!"
1,"The sad thing is that every Japanese resident of Clark County would rather shop at Greenland Market than Nakata or Japan Creek.  Whenever I am at Greenland, I find every single Japanese person I know hanging out at the \""Japanese food aisle\"". I constantly run into the cooks from Monta, the angry old man from Ichiza, a ton of various Sushi Chefs, and even the workers from I-Naba. Do these \""authentic\"" Japanese restaurants actually get their ingredients from a Korean Market?\n\nThe produce here is awful and totally f*cking costs too much. \n\nThe only nice workers are the Latino ones, no one else ever even gives me eye contact. \n\nK JUN chicken in the food court was good while it lasted but apparently they f*cking kicked them out. F*ck You Mr. Greenland or whoever the f*ck owns this place!\n\nChappagetti is the best jajangmeon we got here in LV but I feel it's slightly missing something on account of the fact that it's not Chinese owned. Jajangmeon is NOT Korean. It shocks me how many Koreans think it is an authentic Korean dish. Jajangmeon is a Chinese dish which became very popular in Korea. \n\nAnyone who knows me knows that I always bitch to my Japanese friends( most particularly Aaron K) about how Koreans tend to treat me like sh!t. I don't appreciate it at all. My Mom is Korean, so that makes me Korean, and during my youth I constantly attempted to reach out to the Korean community but was always pushed away by snotty FOB Koreans, who hated every single damn thing about me. My Dad is a 3rd generation Japanese American, and no one in my family speaks any other language but English..but is that a just reason to consider me an outsider in the Korean community?  My brother took more of the Korean side of the gene pool and grew up to be 6'5\"". Many of you idiots don't know this but the average height in South Korea is actually around 5'10\"", which is considerably taller than South American and African countries. Koreans tend to be one of the taller ethnic groups in the world. Well, the workers at Greenland assume my brother is Korean on account of his massive height and they treat him pretty darn good, but I can't get any sympathy over here. I hate how at Japanese Markets they think I'm Korean, and at Korean Markets they think I'm Japanese, and at Chinese Markets they think I'm weird.\n\nOKAY.... the best thing here at Greenland is the FROZEN SMILING RABBIT MOON CREME BREAD. Believe me, you have to f*cking try it. Pictured here:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qVO3l9Q0-KVQE7W9JL9ePw?fsid=IOt7lW-WFEOARLbS_yG77w#Vb2-TK6mBKPndNEUkb3Y2A\n\nThey also sell those mega sized Mexican cokes for 1/4 the price you would get them at \""World of Coke\"" for. World of Coke is officially useless now, and sucks!\n\nI've experienced this epidemic of White dudes married to Asian women trying to shield their wives when I walk by them.  They literally grab their wives and hold them really tight when they make eye contact with me. What the f*ck is this? What the hell is going on here? I know I'm really f*cking hot, and I'm a giant womanizer, but I'm not gonna steal your damn mail order bride. Stop being so paranoid! I have white uncles and most my white friends are married to Asian women.It's funny cause in Hawaii, it's just a casual normal thing for Whites and Asians to marry..but for some reason the people here in LV think they are living some \""John Lennon-Yoko Ono\"" fantasy and that their relationship is \""forbidden\"" or some stupid sh!t. Go shop at Albertsons or Smiths then if you don't feel comfortable shopping around Asian people. \n\nWhenever I come to this Koreatown shopping center, I usually just walk straight over to \""SUSHI ON RAINBOW\"", while my brother eats at Chappagetti. I don't know how we turned out so different. \n\nThe Moral of the Story is to eat FROZEN SMILING RABBIT MOON CREAM BREAD with Mexican coke.\n\nUPDATE- Today I was at Greenland Market and the workers were talking about how confused they were that  everyone was now suddenly buying Frozen Smiling Rabbit Moon Cream Bread. Apparently, they had a hard time selling it in the past."
3,"I love this place, for the most part.  Except I don't get why rice is so expensive!  I tend to find the majority of stuff I need and a lot more stuff I don't here.  The only real complaint I have about this place is some of the prices.  The Asian candy costs just as much here and sometimes more than in \""American\"" stores  I could probably drive to San Diego get the same things at my old store and drive back for less than it costs  here.  I also don't like how some (more than a few) of the produce is going to go bad within a day if not use and some already looks like it went bad.\n\nBut at this place, a lot of random out there items can be found, and their meat dept doesn't seem bad at all and actually reasonable"
2,"Ce restaurant Scores est un exemple parfait de la cha\u00eene. L'endroit est propre, moderne et ouvert. On y offre un buffet de salades qui quelquefois pourrait \u00eatre un peu plus frais. Le poulet est excellent et les prix sont raisonnables. \n\nUn petit conseil, les articles du menu midi ne sont vraiment pas la meilleure aubaine. Il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de prendre le quart de poulet dans le menu courant qui inclut le buffet de salades.  La diff\u00e9rence de prix ne justifie pas le verre de boisson gazeuse et le dessert d\u00e9cevant du menu midi."
3,"The Phoenix airport is one of my favorite airports, and I can say I do a lot of traveling! Rarely do I run into problems in the Phoenix airport. Flights always have their issues with delays and whatnot regardless of where you are, but there are just some airports that seem to have more issues with people getting stuck there overnight, and luckily I have not run into that here. Weather is frequently good and flights can get off the ground without issue. If by chance you do get delayed the proximity of the Phoenix airport to plenty of hotels in the vicinity, unlike the Denver airport where you have to take a shuttle for an hour to get to the place they put you up in. Security lines usually go quickly and there are tons of great places to have a drink or snack while you wait for your flight. Relatively clean facilities as well."
3,"BJ's is a large scale brewhouse and has the usual bar menu.  The one dish that sets it apart and keeps me coming back has got to be, Avocado Spring Rolls!  Delicious, warm, a joy to eat.  I swear to god, the 2nd time I had these was better then the first.  \n\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5??  Well, the first time I went with a friend, we tried one of the microbrews.  It was so flavorless and tasted as if it had been tapped a years before completion.  Anyway, I stick to the beers I know and love, same with the food :-)"
2,"I've always came here for their boba milk teas and Italian sodas and they are super yum. I was pretty much a regular about 2 summers ago until I read how many calories 1 milk tea had.\nI was drinking them with my meals and twice a day, wondering why I went up almost 2 pant sizes lol.\n\nBut if you don't really care about all that then definitely go here for your bubble teas n so on. \nMy favorites are the avocado flavor and chocolate. \n\nThe lil Asian lady that works there is always so nice but really quiet.\n\nAs far as food goes, I've never tried anything but the spam musubi and chicken katsu..\nI mean the food quality seems home-made,I like that...it's not amazing but it's  not too bad.\n\n\nOne thing i cannot stand is how muggy it always feel inside, especially in the summer. ick!\n\n \nI have been coming here for 2 years now so they must be doing something right."
4,"Even though it doesn't have the old fashioned charm of the Field House, The Kohl Center is a fantastic place to watch a Sporting event.  I have been here for several things and have had a great time every time!  The Wheelchair seating is fantastic and I love the fact that they have options at all price points. The staff is always friendly and helpful, too.  The food options are the best I've had at any College Venue. I always save room for an Ice Cream Cone from The Sweet Shoppe!"
1,"Disappointing menu.  Many Middle Eastern foods missing and replaced with Italian dishes, like a pasta and a caprese salad (yes, really).  Notice the wonderful scallops on the photo of the restaurant?  They were out of them.\n\nVery few selections if you do not eat meat.  Portions were small, the tabooli was OK as was the yogurt (Labni), the kefta was seasoned OK.  The cheese filled phyllo was not phyllo but some brick like dough ball. They were just awful. The bread was just so so.\n\nMuch better places to try are Pars on frank Lloyd Wright or Persina Room.  Much better, cheaper and more food."
3,"Consistently better over the past couple years. Hard to give any corporate pizza joint a 5 star rating, but they are definitely a good place to pick up some inexpensive eats."
0,"Where do I start? I use to live right down the street and would go to Giant Robot, which was directly next to this wannabe boutique. Every time I was in Frances never a hello, how are you, can I help you? I once even tried on this over priced \""fashionable\"" dress and the girl working there didn't even acknowledge the fact I needed a dressing room. I could of stole it for all she cared. Besides being avoided like the plague, their selection of clothes are awful. Unless you enjoy paying way too much to dress as if you are in an episode of Little House on the Prairie.\n\nLast time my boyfriend was in town he wanted a pair of Tom's. I figured to try my luck here once more. He's a young, attractive man and since the girls seem to deem me as some kind of disease perhaps they wouldn't give him the cold shoulder. Maybe, just maybe they would be friendly. Well once again the store was empty, not a hello or welcome. Just a cold glance. We helped ourselves to the Tom's, admired all the bird merchandise that would fit right into my grandmothers house and decided we had enough of a look. Once at the counter the older woman finally looked at my boyfriend and said \""Is that all?\"". Mind you I was the one paying, she wouldn't even look at me, instead just put her hand out reaching for my card then slide it across the counter back at me. Excuse me but I make a very good income, you should never judge a book by it's cover. These women running this little shop seem to lack the most important part of running a business, customer service! Sadly Giant Robot closed down and I will take my chances driving to HUB Clothing for a pair of Tom's, where my money is always welcomed. \n\nPortlandia has Frances Boutique pegged. \""Put a bird on it!\"", so fitting for this store."
4,"Wow, I was blown away with my first visit to Luna's!  I had this place on my bookmark list to try for a long time, but didn't make the effort to go until my trainer was recently raving about their Rawco Taco salad.\n\nSo naturally, when I FINALLY went, that is exactly what I decided to order.  The salad was a large size and full of fresh organic lettuce. It also features fresh avocado, pico de gallo, meaty walnut almond crumbles and cashew sour cream.  It also comes with the most delicious hot sauce (I had to order a second serving of the hot sauce, that stuff is YUMMY!) and raw herbed veggie triangles.  The salad definitely filled me up and it was so delicious! I am craving it again just thinking about it!  The salad was $14.50, so it was a bit on the pricey side for lunch, but I absolutely adored it! \n\nI couldn't resist trying their Ginger Ale. The ginger ale is made with fresh Ginger juice, lemonade, carbonated water, and agave.  It was really tasty but at $6.00, it was a bit of a splurge. \n\nAs much as I loved the Rawco Taco salad, on my next visit, I'd really like to try the Lunasagna.  I really wish this place was a little closer to my neighborhood so I could eat here more frequently."
0,"I only gave them one star because it may look like I just didn't rate them if I left it at 0. WORST PLACE EVER!! I was told by a rude salesperson and an even more rude manager that I did not qualify for the 04 ford expedition I went to see before I was even given an opportunity to test drive. After leaving highly upset I stopped down the road at City Chevrolet where I was greeted by a courteous sales professional by the name of Avon Spann \""THE CHEVY MANN\"". Not only did he get me in a 2014 vehicle which I didn't qualify for as far as ford was concerned. But he treated me so well I don't want to buy cars from anyone or anywhere else. Even if you want a Ford still go see The CHEVY MANN @ City Chevrolet. He'll get you anything you ask for. My brother is working with him to buy a BMW that is in Tallahassee, FL"
3,Simple subs. I have always liked blimpe subs they taste great. Simple assembly line style sub making.
3,"This is probably one of my favorite places for brunch/lunch at the moment. the atmosphere is so classy and beautiful. the service is wonderful. and the food is great! the bf and i went for brunch and i had the short rib hash. so yummy. Ive also had their steak sandwich. the reason i took off a star was because they gave me a burnt bun. even when i asked if i could get a new bun, the new bun was burnt too! so it changed the flavor of the sandwich. Other than that, all great!"
1,Sandwich is dry... I will stick to Jimmy Johns... Got fooled by the $4 lunch special...
0,I use to love this nail salon. I went every two weeks for a fill and pedi. until they got new owners who turn me down every time I walk through the door and ask me to come back another day? I've heard that they only have one nail technician who does acrylic everyone else can only do pedis and manicures. One time I got a pedi from the owners 15 year old son....Not professional at all. One rare occasions where they didn't turn me away my nails were done very quickly and usually bumpy and uneven.
1,"I don't get why there is always a line to get into this place. The word \""junk\"" is in the title... and it lives up to its namesake.\n\nI've only ever been here to meet up with friends at night - and it's definitely not a place I would choose to go to on my own. The layout is weird - I've I dig the patio, but to have the VIP seating smack dab in the middle of the room and right where you walk in causes a lot of crowding by the entrance. And then the dance floor is always hard to get to when the place is filled. But I don't think I'd want to hang out there anyway - there's always some slightly overweight and drably dressed women dancing up on the platform. I'm in no way considering myself dance club elite or a Scottsdale Snob, but I go out in Scottsdale as opposed to Tempe because I've grown out of that college kid scene, but I guess Scottsdale still thinks it's cool.\n\nAs for the drinks, nothing special. Although I found it strange that they used plastic party cups when serving pitchers of beer. This place reeks of the shoddy clubs you can find on Mill during the semester. There are definitely better places to go in Old Town. I think AJ's attempt at trashy glamour just comes off trashy."
4,"Monday and Wednesday at 9:30 Hegel Yoga  has the best  beginning yoga class I have ever taken. I felt like I really stretched and worked, but it wasn't so hard that I don't want to go back. She has other classes for people who are advanced, but I won't be attending those. I am sticking with her beginning class. Love it! HEr place is moving next week somewhere on Kyrene, so look up the new address."
2,"We only went in because we were staying in Treasure Island and wouldn't have to pay cover. As it turned out, they didn't seem to charge cover anyway. Place opens at 10:30, and you can get bottle service, which starts at $100 for this and that. I didn't want this and that, though, I just wanted to see why the hell anyone would be attracted to a club where so many douche nozzles wore the eponymous clothing line. That's the only reason why I agreed to stand in line with all the other curious discotequers; I pretended I was doing an ethnographic study. Really.\n\nWhy they had people stand in line was a mystery because once we got inside, there was plenty of room and just a smattering of Paris and Lindsey wannabes getting all scripted-reality-drama lusty with the boys donning Ed Hardy shirts. Inside's actually pretty cool with the blue-lit bar and shiny surfaces. Drink prices are neither pretty nor cool--$10 for a well drink served in a rinky dink plastic cup. \n\nWe had the good fortune of standing next to the long glass wall, from which we got the insider's view of the evening's pirate show. Now, THAT was a treasure. If you enjoy a bit of ahoy matey theatrics with merry singing and cavorting and gunfire and even a sinking ship, then you will be served, in a most fantastic way. But then the show ended, and we quickly grew bored and left with the satisfaction of knowing that we would not need to go back there or buy the dopey gear."
3,"Great neighborhood sushi place!  Close to home, excellent vibe and atmosphere - easy going and never too hectic.  Great service, and the sushi ranges from excellent to good (I think it is tough to get fresh fish every night in Arizona - so, some times, some of the sushi isn't as fresh as others).\n\nCheck the website for their happy hour and 'two for' specials - always helps to feed the heartier appetites!"
4,"Short and sweet--I had a minor skin problem that turned into a gigantic annoyance/pain. Incessant itching to the point of me breaking the skin. My legs looked like battlegrounds from my claws :( Boyfriend all but forced me to head to a derm. I'm glad I finally took the leap, because I was quite miserable.\n\nI, like many other reviews it seems, saw Mike Richards. The assistant that came in before him was so completely pleasant and nice, and she stuck around to take notes while he examined me as well. He immediately figured out what I should do (I'd developed a random form of eczema that wasn't visible to the eye but left me miserable), had her write me a Rx for medicine and since I first applied it the next night, I've been 100% cured. \n\nThey insisted I schedule a followup appointment for a month later in case I needed anything, and said I was free to cancel it if my problem vanished like they said it would. Just called two days ago to happily cancel it. Quality of life: Plus 48302 happy points!"
1,Food tasted good but was cold. Complained to management and was told where to find the microwave. First time going and last. Can zap food at home.
3,Excellent food.  Fast service.  Clean restaurant.  My primary complaint is that the thermostat was set to hold at 65 degrees.  Seriously?  It's freezing in here!  Bring your hand warmers.
1,"My wife and I went with another couple for a birthday celebration. We asked for outdoor seating and had a nice table on the balcony. The hostess was friendly enough. The first person at our table didn't say a word while he poured our water. The server showed up several minutes later, but dismissed our questions quickly refocusing us to explain a menu item that was unavailable and it's alternate. Starters took a while. The mussel app was good until the 5th which was so fishy and rank I had to spit it out (so it was my last). After another 45 minutes, 3 of 4 entrees arrived. After a wait and finally asking the hostess to track down our last entree, it finally was delivered. My salmon and shrimp (the special/alternate) were overcooked but pasta underneath was good. Lasagna had been sitting so long under a heat lamp that a few layers were too hard to eat, meatloaf was ok. Lamb chops were good, but cold by the time meatloaf arrived and we could all start to eat. Very disappointed with the service and food; wine was reasonably priced. Robert Bruce Pinot was very good. No desire to return."
4,"Just plain cool with the kind of edge you can only find in places that have curated their look over time, much like the growing layer of band stickers on the windows here or their collection of vintage and new records in the back. Feels like an old record store-slash-art-studio in here. Just like the sign says out front, go get lost inside for a bit. Coffee is good, but the vibe is the best. Plus, wifi."
4,"Absolutely amazing!! We were there for the weekend for my birthday and we wanted to see as much as we could and what vegas trip is complete without clubs? We did all 4 Palms clubs the first night and Pure the second night! We were on the list and went straight in! No waiting at the Palms but a bit of a wait at PURE because is was so packed. Overall, a great experience and will DEFINITELY use this again!"
0,"Terrible. \n\nMy spaghetti was overcooked and flavorless, the free wine was like vinegar (but what do u expect of free wine), the cappucino tasted like it came from a vending machine, the service was slow, and the old frail man on the accordian was kind of entertaining and cute until he asked for money."
2,"If you're looking for an overpriced complex where you can hear everyone outside from inside your place or hear your neighbors through walls this place is for you. Maintenance is beyond awesome here, but management is a joke. They have now changed it to 60 day notice to move out, so if you need to leave for work or any other reason, plan on getting raped for about 4k to leave early. Everything is very well kept (trying to keep up with local competitors) but the windows have ZERO INSULATION so once again you will hear normal talking voices outside. Not to mention your electric bills will hit around $300 a month with your a/c set at 78 because of this. Last but not least they like to say they need to \""routine inspect\"" pluming and so on, but that's managements way of saying, we don't trust our renters so we are coming in whether you like it or not.\n\nDon't let the looks fool you, look elsewhere"
1,"This place was a huge disappointment. I went here because of all the stellar reviews on Yelp. Yelpers-- you steered me wrong. \n\nI ordered the eggs Benedict. The description said it had shaved ham and basil hollandaise sauce. The waitress made a point of telling me that the \""over easy\"" eggs would be very runny. Ok...Well I thought it was odd that they weren't poached, but went with it since I know Benedict includes a runny egg--It is part of what makes then delicious. I was also eager to try the bread since they made a point of mentioning that all their bread was baked in house. Boy, was I in for a big disappointment!\n\nThe Benedict arrived. It was two Thomas' English muffins with deli meat ham and the basil hollandaise was just sauce garnished with basil. The eggs were not runny--they were raw. I mean the egg whites were raw!\n\nThe waitress seemed startled when I sent it back, but was truly great about it. But...I think you can guess what happened next...It came back with over-cooked eggs...think hard boiled! At this point, I was starving, so I just went with it. The waitress noticed that I wasn't eating much so she didn't charge me.\n\nSo...I give them 5 stars for service, but 1 star for food.\n\nI will say that it is a nice setting and I would go back for a drink, but not much more.  Thank you to the stellar wait staff for somewhat redeeming the experience!\n\nThat being said, I was just visiting the area so I won't likely be back."
3,"We had a large party after my daughters wedding with a set menu. One of my gripes is that they tried to change the deal at the last minute, but with one phone call from my husband things went back to normal. The French onion soup was great, terrific in fact. The prime rig was a very generous portion and the service was attentive. They even allowed us to bring in our own cake and provided the service for that.. BIG Kudos for that. We went back for their late night Happy Hour and it was fantastic. Everyone was very friendly and the decor was beautiful. I would highly recommend  this place for a large event as well."
4,"As someone who lives in Vegas, I have been meaning to go here for the longest time. Delicious. I expected nothing less from Gordon. The only thing I didn't like were the dipping sauces that came with my fries, but that was more of a personal preferences on taste. The wait staff was extremely nice and helpful with the menu. The price is not that bad considering it's on the strip and it's Gordon ramsays name. Would recommend to anybody."
0,"We had a very bad experience here last Saturday.  Our server took 15 mins to greet and take our drink orders.   We decided that we did not want to wait another 15 for shots so we went up to the bar.  Our bartender was also very rude and unwelcoming.  We took the drinks back to our table and was lectured by our waitress for not ordering through her.  I've waited tables for a couple of years and I would never argue with guests.  She made us feel very uncomfortable after the confrontation.   I will never come back here and would never recommend this place.  The food is below average and overpriced, but yeah, these types of businesses are dime a dozen in Las Vegas.  Avoid this place if you can help it.  You work hard for your money, don't hand it over to a business that does not deserve it."
1,"Food is not really good. We had wings, a salad and mashroom pizza. Wings and pizza were not good. This place shoul be 2,5-3 stars."
3,"My coworkers and I went here in July for a workday outing. The whole staff was very accommodating to us and helped us with our food situation when we decided not to eat at their cafe, but helped us enjoy a meal at the real Atria's. \n\nI have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the birds, I am more of a cuddle animal person (so animals I can picture squeezing *_*) but I enjoyed getting up close and personal to these awesome creatures. \n\nBeing able to feed them in during the feeding sessions was such a fun experience!"
4,"Great Brazilian food, awesome experience.\nThe owner is a funny man who made our dinner even better with his great sense of humor. The food was delicious, very home made, I had feijoada and my husband had xin-xin. Both were awesome."
0,"My husband brought 7 jerseys for cleaning to this store.  A few days later they gave him back 6.  He asked for the missing shirt and they denied having it even though he had the receipt stating 7 shirts.  They \""found\"" it in the back, after my husband insisted for them to keep looking.  It was COVERED in chemical stains all over the front and back.  It was soaking wet.  \nThe owner Fanny said if they could not remove the stains they would cover the price for a new jersey.  They never contacted us when they said they would.  Today when we spoke to the owner, she said she would give us store credit and that is all.  She said she did not have $70 to cover the price of a new jersey (we only asked for $70, even though we bought it new a few months ago for $129).Then, ALL OF A SUDDEN, she said she did not speak English!!!!  \n\nWe disputed this with our credit card company.  When the company contacted Fanny's husband Danny, he told our credit card company that they hand washed the jersey (WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION, by the way) because we brought it in covered with grease stains on the back.  It only had faint arm-pit sweat stains when we brought it in.  Now this!\n\nTHIS IS A COMPLETE LIE.  DANNY IS A LIAR.  \n\nDO NOT TAKE YOUR CLOTHES HERE!  \n\nThe missing jersey was an authentic Nike NEYMAR jersey.  They denied EVER having received it, and then tried to hide it  As the World Cup is going on now, we feel strongly they were trying to steal it!  Did they try to steal it and then stained it?  What is going on???  The jersey is COVERED it with chemical stains. \n\nDO NOT TRUST THEM WITH YOUR CLOTHES!!!!"
0,"poor service rounded out with poor quality pizza make this a place to stay away...\n\nnot recommended... \n\ngo to a pizza hut or dominoes near by because this place will leave you spending 45 bucks for 1 awful pizza, 24 soggy wings and a wilted salad"
4,"My husband is a professional hairstylist from Italy, and has had the same lady cutting his hair for 10 years. He decided it was time for a change and we looked high and low for someone who met all of his criteria. Thank God we found this place!\n\nThe facility is clean, welcoming, the barbers are all great and my man walked in and out with a great haircut! My husband is so picky, and now he's recommending this place to all his friends. Randy did a great job!"
0,"Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \""multiple times\"" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \""Oh, you wanted another?\"" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated."
4,"I LOVE the Bellagio Shops, Even more than Crystals, which can be snooty.\n\nI was looking for a new wallet for my mothers 65th birthday and browsed all the shops... I looked at Louis Vuitton and the Flap wallets were such bad quality! No leather, Just monogram canvas.\n\nMy Boyfriend then suggested Prada, and we found the right store to pick up some goodies. THE NICEST sales associate helped us, Sean Azizov. \n\nThanks Sean! \n\nI bought a Red SaffianoTriangle Flap Wallet! Fabulous and such great quality.\nAlso, a black Saffiano leather card case for my BF.\nMy mother loved her gift."
3,"The spa cost about $35 per person. I loved the tranquil atmosphere and the clean facilities. The idea of public bathhouses/bathrooms/anything usually make me gag but this spa is extremely well kept that I didn't even realize that I was in the nude in public. Speaking of nude, you can wear a bathing suit if you do not wish to expose yourself so no worries if you're shy. Also, when you are in the bathing area, make sure you wear slippers so you do not slip and crack open your skull like an egg (mmm...I love runny eggs...). If you want, bring your own shampoo/conditioner/soap or you can use the ones provided in the showers. There is free fruit, coffee, juice, and water provided within the facility as well. Lastly, I really liked the fact it wasn't that crowded the day I was there. Next time I'm definitely going to get a massage. Can't wait. For those of you are there already: Nap! Enjoy! Relax!"
3,"Was doing some Christmas Shopping with my Son and decided to stop by this joint based on the great reviews we saw on Yelp.  I've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered Wings w/Med Sauce ($10), Sliders w/Fries ($10), and Momma's BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger w/half Fries & half Onion Rings($10).  Our server Joanna, who was very nice, helped us select these items.  First up was the Wings.  They were pretty good.  Joanna recommended getting the Med Sauce for the flavor but having the Hot Sauce on the side for the heat.....it worked!  It was very good.\n\nMy Son had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and it was huge!  He said he enjoyed it.  I tried some of his Onion Rings....they were thick, crunchy, Beer-battered, and soooo good!  The Onions had a nice sweet flavor to them that went well with the Beer-batter crust....pure awesome!\n\nMy Sliders were pretty good....I wouldn't say they were great, but good.  They were slightly overcooked....well done.  I think the cook took them off the grill Med-Well and then it got Well-Done between the kitchen and the table.  They had good flavor though and the Bread was really good...the best part of the dish.\n\nOverall, we had a great lunch and Joanna was especially helpful.  She has a great personality and made us feel welcome and special.\n\nWill we return?  We spotted a few other items on the menu we want to try, so next time we're in the area, we plan to come back."
4,"Chronic tacos is my favorite place to have lunch at work. It helps that it's Mexican food which is my all time favorite food. My favorite thing to get it the handheld burrito. It's not as big as there normal burrito but it's perfect for lunch. When you order after 2pm you het free chip and salsa which are amazing as well. I really like their steak, seasoned pretty well. Not a huge fan of the chicken, but I like to change it up once in a while. \n\nAnother thing I like is they have the limes on the line for tacos and burritos. Also the staff is really nice. They put on extra cheese or salsa for me if I ask. Plus they always chat me up when they can. Cool place to go."
2,"I like the atmosphere and I LOVE the curry chicken salad sandwich (easy on the red onion). Also a big fan of their ice tea and generous refills. The brownies and cupcakes, however, are dangerously addictive.\n\nThey recently expanded the menu to include a whole host of new sandwiches all made with fresh, locally produced meats. If I can break my curry chicken salad habit, I will definitely try them.\n\nThe free wifi is okay but don't be surprised if you lose your signal occasionally. \n\nIf you sit out on the patio, you may get to enjoy some exceptional people watching. BONUS!"

0,"Phoenix Zoo employee Brandon (white male in his 20s). who was working the front gate called me a Dick. \n\nYou are not gonna believe this, I'm still in shock. Worst interaction with any employee ever. \nMy mother was visiting here from out of town and we decided to take my 2 1/2 year old my mom and myself to the Phoenix Zoo today.\nWe got there at noon and purchase the Wild Ride bands.  We spent all day at the zoo and were exhausted at the end of the day. It was 5PM and the zoo was closing so we were making our way to the exit. I had my 2 1/2 yr old daughter in a wagon and had pulled her around the zoo, I've been to the zoo several times and know that they want most traffic to exit through the gift shop but I didn't want to lug around my wagon into the gift shop, instead I preferred to exit through the entrance so I made my way towards the entrance to exit.  There was one young guy standing right in the middle of the gates and he said to me are you looking for the exit and I said well I want to exit here instead of going through the gift shop because I don't want to roll this wagon through there and he responded sorry you have to this is not an exit. I wasn't turning around though so I kept walking toward the left side of the gate, he was still standing in the middle of the section and said you can't exit here and I said, well listen this gate here opens can you just open it? (I waited for him to come over and offer to help but he stood fast where he was and said no)\nWhen I realized he wasn't going to accommodate I started to work the latch and I said it opens this way right (pulling instead if pushing)? he says No, then I pushed and it opened and he said it opens that way.\n(At this point I wasn't mad, just wanted to leave). As I opened the gate and rolled through I said I am not going through the gift shop with my daughter and this wagon, when you have kids you'll understand, to which he replied; \""maybe you should learn how to say no.\"" I stopped in my tracks and turned to him (still leaning against the turn style) and I said \""Maybe you should mind your own business.\"" Then I turned around again and heard; \""maybe you shouldn't be such a Dick.\"" WOW I was really speechless that an employee would say something like that in front of my child!!!! Of course physical contact is out of the question so I said \""do you like working here because today's your last day buddy.\""\nHe looked and rolled his eyes, I said get your manager out here right now and he said \""No.\"" So I noticed his radio was sitting on the gate right in front if him so I walked up to grab it and he said oh no and took it. I turned around looking for someone and no one was there so I started to call the zoo on my cell phone and just then an employee was walking in the office and I waved her down from the outside she came out and I explained what just happened and the she said OK hold on and went back in to return moments later with a supervisor, I didn't catch her name but she came out and shook my hand and introduced herself. \nI explained what just happened and she looked at the employee and waited for his response.  He said I walked up and asked for him to open the gate and then I just opened the gate and walked out. He totally denied everything after that and didn't admit anything! Crazy right?!\nI've gotta say in hindsight this supervisor didn't handle this effectively. The first thing she started to explain to me was their gate/exit policy saying how they do ask all guests to exit thru the gift shop and that the only reason the entrance gate is open is because of the fire code...I kind of interrupted her and said \""you don't have to explain that to me...\"" Then just asked what's your policy if a guest insists on exiting here are you required to allow it and she said yes. OK then that's end of story this guy did nothing and was very inappropriate and she said \""well this is a he said she said and we will have a talk with him. \""\nWhen I got home I told my wife what happened and she was furious, she said you paid to have a good experience there and an employer was not only rude to you for no reason but used bad language in front of your child and no one apologized to you or offered you anything. What kind of experience is that???\nSo I decided that first I need to notate what happened so I don't forget, second I am going to place a call tomorrow to the park manager and discuss what took place.\nI was real exhausted today and just wanted to leave and didn't take the time to think about how I should of handled this.\n\nUpdate to this review:\nI called the Zoo Tuesday morning and left a message for Jennifer which is Janelles supervisor but she never called me back, so I called the zoo Wed and asked for Jannelles boss Bonnie and left her a msg in the AM and no one called back. If I hear something I will update this review."
2,"I used to LOVE Sonic when I lived in NC, but since we moved to MD, there isn't one near me.  I revisited my long lost love while in Charlotte on vacation and was somewhat dissapointed.  I don't remember them microwaving their chili dogs and the tater-tots seemed very old....  The only reason I give it 3 stars is because the server was great.  He was very attentive and quick."
2,"This is a review I have hesitated writing for a while now.  I have been so up in ther air about Mix Zone.  I could never decide whether I like it or not.  Well, my friends, today I have made my decision (see star rating for confirmation).\n\nI have ordered from Mix Zone I think twice in the past year and a half.  Compare that to the almost weekly visits to other places like Pad Thai and Weera Thai and you begin to see a pattern.  It is not that the food is bad at Mix Zone.  The curry dishes are good.  The BBQ pork is fine.  I'm not a fan of thin bone-in grilled pork chops but the flavor is pleasent.  I guess the real reason I choose not to visit Mix Zone is that they do not have many options on the lunch menu.  Furthermore, when speaking of value, the price here is higher than at some places that still have quality food and more options.  It is nice that they offer a drink with their lunch special. The other places I have mentioned do not give you such a treat.  That gives Mix Zone a bump up from 2.5 stars to three in my book."
0,Hands down the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in Vegas. Which is really a shame because I loved staying at the palms place and the front desk service was phenomenal. When me and my group got to the restaurant the hostess sat us and it wasn't busy. After about 20 min the waiter came and got our drink order and walked off. I overheard the table behind us talking about how poor the service was and how they should leave. The waiter then goes and talks with a female co worker for ten minutes before coming back to re take out order because he didn't write it down and thought he could remember it...apparently too difficult. So we sit and wait another 15-20 and notice tables around looking irritable and one gets up and leaves. I try to wave the waiter over and he ignores it...we get up and leave and never even got our drinks in the hour we were there. Will not recommend to anyone.
4,"At sunset, the experience is awesome.  It's very romantic for the ladies.  The prices are up high, so I wouldn't encourage going if you are on a budget or trying to hold out.  My motto is if you are going to go out, go all out and don't hold back.\n\nThe food is awesome, the wine selection is really good, and the atmosphere is cool.  Also like the gradual rotation.\n\nThe only sad thing for me is that the last time I went they had removed the tower of chocolate from the dessert menu.  It was one of the high points for us when we went the first time because it's a need little model of the stratosphere made of different types of chocolate.  That was the only dissapointment.\n\nI recommend the lobster bisque, potatos au gratin, lamb chops, and ravioli (I think lobster or shrimp filled)."
2,"This show was great when i watched at about 11 years of age. Now that I look back, I don't remember any spectacular tricks he did. Same old, same old. Doves flying, dissapearing. Great for a first time magic show watcher, but if you love magic shows, skip this one."
2,"Went in tonight and had some seaweed salad, calamari, a Texas and Oregon roll. Everything was really good and the waitress/hostess had them make the seaweed salad the way I asked, which was pretty cool. Worth checking out if you want some sushi and are in the area."
1,I took my family for breakfast here. The food was average. The general store has a lot of knickknacks to look at but generally speaking it was nothing special. The oatmeal we ordered had no taste. My waffle tasted like what  you'd  get at a motel breakfast bar. coffee tasted burnt and was your average drip coffee that comes out of a flask. Generally speaking it was nothing worth coming back to.
1,The wait wasn't bad and the workers were friendly. Huge shocker of the day was that this was the first time I have had to do emissions testing on my vehicle. Right on cue my gas cap failed the test and they got to bleed me for another $13. Meanwhile my yearly registration is nearly $300 and the motorhome built in 1976 in front of me in line passed. I'm happy I have a job and continue to pay taxes.
1,"I have been to Crown & Anchor a few times with friends.  I guess I'm just far too old to be drawn into the hype, but I was not impressed.  Perhaps if you just celebrated your 21st birthday and you want to get smashed, this is a good place for you.  I'm not that person, so I just find the droves of college kids annoying.  \n\nI didn't take away stars for that preference, though.  I took away stars for the food.  What is everyone so hung up on here?  I've done the whole fish & chips thing plenty of times in my life, and this doesn't even rate with me.  I agree with a previous poster who said that the fish just seemed like it was frozen.  I wasn't that into it.  I guess I'm nuts, because a lot of people swear by the fish here.  However, I've had better.  I've had WAAAAAAY better in other cities, and I've even had better here in Vegas.  \n\nThe service is slow if you order food.  I do enjoy sitting outside on the patio, but if I'm paying to eat something, I don't wanna feel like I basically paid for the ambiance."
3,One of my favorite places to grab a thick juicy steak and martini. All the dishes I have had there have been great and the drinks are stiff. I also love the fact that the place is so dark the waiters have to use a flashlight to help you look at the menu. Careful!! Those plates are sizzling hot!! MMmmastros. I will be back again soon!
0,"Given just a 1 star for this particular location is for the sake of it's name. Other than that, I would gladly had given a zero if I could. The other two locations on Spring Mountain are well rated because staff that actually acknowledged their customers. Unlike this location. \n\nWas the very first time for my family and I to come here because of distance, so we decided to come here. Came inside, no wait at all, no one greeted us, waited at the door for a good 7 mins, then sat us. Took our order after 10 mins, waiter didn't give us any specials, what they didn't have, what wasn't in season etc... Ordered 3lbs of Hot n Juicy seasoned shrimp mild and 1lbs of Crawfish with same seasoning. Order didn't come out till 30 mins later, without any lemons or butter, not even the salt and pepper. We basically had to ask for everything that was already supposed to be with our orders. Orders of food that wasn't ours kept coming to our table, waiters were confused and didn't know which orders belonged to what table. \n\nRipped into the bag of shrimp, which was over cooked, but was tasty and little spicy. Ripped into the crawfish and the bag only had 2 big pieces and the rest were about a size of a quarter some even smaller believe it or not. Then asked the server if they had bigger ones they can change for me or exchange it with shrimp instead. She then said \""oh they're not in season\"" which she was supposed to mention before we ordered (pass visits in other location) also with Boiling Crab. If she had mentioned that the crawfish was out of season, then obviously we wouldn't have gotten that. \n\nWaiter then asked a fellow co worker (man waiter) on what to do. He came to our table\nAnd told us, there's nothing we can do, you can order what you want with the same charges that's on the menu or take it off the bill (very rude). So not only did we wait a while for our food, being the fact that my kids were hungry, they didn't acknowledge or take care of their customer needs by exchanging what we wanted since it was wrong on their end. \n\nAt this point I was already furious and wanted to leave, I then asked for the check right away, ruined our whole dinner, and they even forgot to get my check, so I went up to the register waited for them to print out my check, and they also charged me for extra butter and rice that I didn't ask for, but I still paid it, money wasn't the problem on my end. While I was waiting at the register, two customers got up from their seats and asked for hot sauce, forks and spoons. That shows lack of customer service. Something has to be done. Perhaps a more thorough customer service education? I would rather drive the miles than to come back to this place. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE. I will stick to Boiling Crab. Happy New Year!"
3,I find myself here pretty often because it's so close to my apartment and school. The service here is always friendly and quick  and they have a great selection of beers. They've always been accommodating when we come in large groups so that's a nice touch. We usually order the cheese fries to share while enjoying beer outside on the benches. I can't speak for the other items on the menu since I've never actually had a meal here. Overall a nice place to sit and relax on a sunny day.
2,"Not sure how to describe this place other than average in certain areas and below par in other areas. The salad section has all the usual ingredients and they were fresh and well-stocked right after the lunch rush. I could clearly make a great salad and they had fat-free dressings which is good for my health kick of late. Once you get beyond the salads, your kind of on your own with more misses than hits. The soups were unimpressive that day, sans for a semi-decent beef vegetable soup, but the rice in the chicken rice soup was way overcooked and mushy. Then you had all the salads that were loaded down with mayo - about five of them, none of which looked appetizing. Baked Potatoes, mac n chese, tacos, cracker pizza , all of these should be eaten at your own risk. Most of the bread didn't cut the mustard either, except for an average garlic breadstick. Desert was the usual stuff like jello and pudding and frozen ice cream? from the ole machine. At $6 with a coupon, there is nothing wrong with going here for a good salad, but beyond that, it seems like a crapshoot."
4,"Now this isnt a five star resort. It's not the bellagio or the Wynn. Once you get that in your head, it's pretty cool! The room was alright. Nothing special at all. The bed was nice, the ac is loud at times, the elevator is definitely different, and the shower was a little confusing to figure out. The fremont street experience can be loud but we're usually out when it's super loud 7pm-1am. Sigma derby is the best game in Vegas, absolutely love it! The longbar was great! Loved having Labatt blue on tap!!! Overall, it's a solid, clean, affordable room and it's a blast!"
3,"I come here almost every night... mostly I really like it, but I do have a few complaints. Almost every bartender completely ignores me for about 10-15 min when I sit down, regardless of if they have 2 bar patrons or 40. The exception to this is a bartender named Zy (very cute), Sara (also very cute) and a bald black fellow (not sure of his name). The front door guys/bouncers are awesome. They always remember my face/name and want to say hello and have a conversation. The bowling is a tad expensive, but the table tennis and corn hole is free. They have a bathroom attendant on certain nights, which is really annoying. I can wash my hands myself and I don't like people waiting a few feet away while I do my business. Having a bathroom attendant doesn't make the place more upscale, it makes me not want to use the bathroom there. The country music at the end of the night makes me want to regurgitate all of my drinks, but maybe that's their way of getting everyone to leave."
2,"I've been to Bombay Indaian Grill a couple of times now and everything I've had there was delicious. I've gotten the Bengan Bartha (spicy eggplant) and Aloo Gobi (cauliflower with potatoes), both of which were very tasty with a side of naan bread. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because the food is overpriced: $10 for a small cup of stewed vegetables and naan bread... Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.\n\nOverall, I like the food there but because I don't like feeling ripped off, I probably won't come back too often, unless I'm in the vicinity and have an extreme craving for Indian food."
1,"We went to Red Robin to celebrate my daughter's birthday using her free hamburger coupon.  We did not have a printed version of this coupon because we exceed the allotted times we could view it.  We had an email on my husband's phone and he said he would honor it.  When the bill arrived it was not taken off and when we questioned it. the server said his manager needed a printed copy??  We were so annoyed as we had asked before hand if this was a problem.  The Red Robin Royalty card has never worked well for us, registration issues, not getting our hamburgers counted, etc. and now this.  \nThe food was fine, but it was very overpriced.  It was $55 for 4 burgers and drinks.  It should of been less but they wouldn't honor the birthday burger coupon.  \nWe will not return."
0,"If I could give negative stars, I would! I bought some swim trunks here for my husband for over $60. The fit is super small so they didn't fit and when I tried to exchange them within one day of receiving them, they would not do an exchange or return. This place is a total scam and now I am stuck with swim trunks that are too small. I will never buy anything with Frank and Oak again. I highly recommend avoiding this company!"
2,"I'm a NY-style pizza lover, so this super-sweet sauce freaked me out. \nNothing else about the pizza was good enough to come back. I'm not getting all the hype."
1,Nice place but DO NOT take an apartment facing South Blvd. Extremely loud music from local bars until 2-3 am Thursday through Saturday
3,"This is the best service I have ever had at any place in TI.  The waiter Aaron was friendly, took pictures for us, had our drinks filled the whole time, and even made sure our glasses were full so we could take them with us when we left.  We ordered the 25 dollar mega appitizer that comes with a ceramic volcano erupting with dry ice.  The nachos were amazing.  We filled up on the appitizer, it was so good.  It was fun watching the bartender toss up the bottles trying to flair and drop them.  It was a fun place to have lunch with my friend on her birthday."
3,"I dined here with a friend of mine this week, and I must say I'm a big 'ol fan of AZ 88; this place has a very cool, chic ambiance that I wasn't expecting. The decor, too, was very intriguing (and I think changes occasionally?) - there was a deconstructed taxi cab suspended from the ceiling (which surprisingly I didn't notice until I had sat down and was surveying the restaurant - it's not as overhwhelming a piece of art as you might assume), and the wall behind the bar is entirely populated with license plate numbers of NY cabs, which was unusual but like I said - intriguing. \n\nIt's a seat-yourself kind of place, and the service wasn't terrible - our waiter was oddly expressive the entire time - almost like he was acting. It was bizarre. But whatever; no complaints otherwise. \n\nI ordered the Key Lime Martini for starters (on my never-ending quest to find a Key Lime [Pie] Martini to beat the one at Magnolia in L.A.), and it was delicious...because it was missing the \""pie\"" part of the martini that I love, it didn't top the charts, but it had great flavor and wasn't overpoweringly alcoholic.\n\nMy friend and I went with the dipping fries as our appetizer, which were waffle fries (WAFFLE FRIES!!) with three dipping sauces (hence the name): a remoulade, a spicy chili ketchup and a Buffalo bleu cheese. All of them were great, but my fav was definitely the spicy chili ketchup...I'm a true ketchup lover, so this spin on an old favorite was something I could appreciate. The waffle fries were - sorry to say - NOT as good as Chick-Fil-A's (oh come on...you know they're good), but my friend and I enjoyed them nonetheless.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Burger Au Poivre, mostly because I'm obsessed with peppercorns. This thing was covered with peppercorns and saut\u00e9ed in a burgundy sauce with minced red onion...OMG YUM. I added to this a bit of that spicy chili ketchup and was seriously in burger heaven. It was so juicy and warm...I'm salivating just thinking about it. Another yelper talked about a drippy sandwich that they had here, and based on my experience, it seems like drippy sandwiches are basically AZ 88's thing. And ya know what, it works for them, it really does.\n\nThis is one place I'd definitely go back...I feel like there's just so much I still want to try! And best of all, AZ 88 won't break the bank."
0,"Zoe's is probably not a place to go if you are a Vegan. Actually, it's probably not a place to go if you are a T-rex either. When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.\n\nZoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.\n\nThe food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.\n\nThere's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again."
4,"Delicious protein-style cheeseburger with onion, fries and drink and the place is clean....up to the standards! A go-to-stop whenever in the area."
0,"used to be a decent place to go play pool, watch the big game and enjoy a few beverages... has fallen hard recently- food is bad, service is worse. no thanks"
2,"This place looks a bit different now..seems like it is more dooshbag friendly now. It has a pretty little bar which they made way too small, pretty little backyard and what looks like could become pretty little VIP areas. Oh Scottsdale, you have lost your wild west touch. Now we have about three bars left that are wild and untamed. This is just another cookie cutter twenty-something hangout now. They were still fixing the upstairs room and have no website up yet either. The patio looks sort of the same, but they cleaned it up and put cornhole there now. \n    The happy hour is not unique and innovative as they advertise, it is just dumb. They only have four specials, one drink from beer, wine, mixed and that's all. Only one beer on happy Hour price? Not a really bright marketing team, but maybe they are focusing on food, where they have six happy hour specials (although one is same price as normal). I guess time will tell what happens here, but it is 360 degrees different than the ranch and that is not really a good thing if you favor the wild, untamed version of Scottsdale bar life."
0,They should have a rating of zero stars.  I play 20 bucks to wait an hour for at best a half clean car.  Stay away!!! Danny must not get his car cleaned here.
3,"We visit Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co whenever we are in Chandler, AZ . The food is absolutely incredible and the staff is always very attentive. We can always count on an excellent dinning experience when we come here."
3,"Red Room Saloon is one of those places that you just don't really know about. It's funny because I knew it was a flair bar, but I've been too busy to go. My friends work there and I was just in shock when I went to open bar. Red Room is a small little bar with some tables and seats...recognized from Target. It's got gaming and 1 circle bar. It's funny because I saw some old friends. Erin who actually taught me to flair. There's Mike from Kahunaville. Toby Ellis, one of the best bartenders in the world. Then Mike showed me to a booth and found out he owned the place. Now Red Room has lots of potential. It was an open bar event hosted by spyonvegas.com and Skyy Vodka. Knowing who was serving drinks I knew it would be good. Definitely a fun place. The dj was cool. Not your typical top 40. Come on he made Neil Diamond cool. Definitely a lil off kilter, local bar. So yes a 5 star to support my friends and to support the community! Ok wait...knock off one star cuz parking did suck."
4,"Gotta give props where props are do. So staff : props! Pizza : props location : props\n\nStaff: Asia, Chloe, Devon PROPS"
2,"Got to try this place finally for the first time. Heard good things abut them so coming here was a no brainer.\n\nI gotta give them props for their menu. It looks like they put a lot of thought and detail into it. For example, if you were craving a certain item like soup, bam! All the soups they have are all in one section. This applies to all others like noodles, seafood, etc. We ordered Salt n Pepper Calamari, Salt n Pepper Porkchops, and Honey Walnut Shrimp. \n\nThe Honey Walnut Shrimp was decent, but to me it seemed to lack a bit of sauce to it. When we got the plate, it already looked like somebody ate some shrimp off of it. If you refer to my picture, you can see that they don't give you much shrimp to begin with. The best Honey Walnut Shrimp I ever had was at Panda Inn in the city of La Palma, Ca. \n\nBoth the Salt n Pepper Porkchops and Salt n Pepper Calamari was very good. The only thing lacking I thought was some kind of sauce to dip it in. There was soy sauce on the table but that will only add to the saltiness of the two entrees. I was thinking sweet n sour sauce would be perfect to dip it in. \n\nService was very good. They took our order and processed it right away. We got our food in no time. Refills were constant and im glad because of the salt content we ordered which was good with the steamed rice we ate it with.\n\nThe main negative thing that stood out for me was the prices. With all the three items we ordered plus tax it came out to 41 dollars and that's without any drinks (we had water which was good because it was filtered and not tap water). I thought the food was good but 15 bucks a pop for the Honey Walnut Shrimp and the Salt n Pepper Porkchops is bit much. Even the appetizer Salt n Pepper Calamari was 8.99. \n\nAll in all I thought it was an ok experience based off of the negatives and positives that balanced each other out. All I know is be prepared to spend a lot of money if you are paying for a party of 4 or more.\n\nP.S. They don't give out fortune cookies when you get your check and its a 20 dollar minimum to use debit/credit."
2,"I think there're more wines than whiskies here, and the whiskies are kept behind counters where they're less than accessible (without asking, anyway), but there's a decent selection of both wines and whiskies and the staff are happy to talk to you about them all."
4,Quite possibly the best show I've seen it Vegas! It was phenomenal. Well worth the money. Tickets for tonight sells tickets as well so be sure to keep your eye out. This is a variety show which is just amazing. I'm sure we'll be seeing it again!
1,"I'm surprised that majority of the ratings are 4 stars. My guesses are depending on your palate of what you like to eat rather than quality etc. Next is depending on the day you go they may serve better things, lets say the weekend. I came here on a weekday for dinner and i didn't each much because nothing seems good to me. I go to Vegas quite often and pretty much tried 90% of all the buffets in Vegas. Not embarrassed to say, people don't call me a buffet queen for nothing you know. So I am comparing them to each other. Here is a few things in a nutshell:\n\nThe Chimichurri sauce was extremely spicy without warning. Although I guess its my fault for not catching all the chilli flakes that were in there but it would have been a nice courtesy to put that on a menu card. (minus-1/2 star) The biscuits were hard and cold as if it may injure someone if I threw it across the room. I even questioned if it was suppose to be for display only and I grabbed it by accident since they were cold. (minus-1/2 star) The presentations of the food were ok not great. For a place that big, I would have thought there were a lot of varieties but there wasn't. The seafood are not as fresh as many other buffets I have had in Vegas. The desserts were good but again not great. They had macarons which I love but they were thrown all over the place on a dish. Some fell off to the table and some were pretty broken up pieces that shouldn't be placed there anymore. (minus 1-star)\n\nIn a way, I kind of like how we can grab our own drinks at the beverage bar yet I also see it as part of a service. So you can be the judge of what floats your boat. The service was great though as the server looked at my receipt while I was getting my food first and when I returned he greeted us my our last names. Very professional. They were friendly and grabs my old plates away pretty quickly. There were ice cream but the person that scoops it was not there. I stood there for almost 5 minutes before she came out from the kitchen. First time this ever happened in Vegas. Don't they have coverage should she need to walk away for a minute?\n\nCost: for about $30/dinner, I have had much better and more variety of selections.  I understand maybe its because the beer and wine are unlimited but think the customer should have a choice to opt out and not pay for that portion if they don't want to drink any alcohol there. (minus-1 star)\n\nSo overall, this place is descent but seriously for the price you pay, I wouldn't eat there again as I had much better elsewhere for a fraction of the cost. See my other reviews for more reviews on other buffets."
1,"We tried several things for lunch (brisket, pulled pork, chicken, chili, beans, mashed potato salad) because we were hoping to find our new go-to eating place. I liked the brisket but that's where the praise ends. Food tasted overly smokey and lacked seasoning. It was also a bit pricey but the portions were large. It's a cute place with lots of charm, everyone was friendly and we really wanted to like it. We might give it another chance in the future - just in case they were having an off day."
0,"Went there, waited 20 minutes for a seat next to an obnoxiously loud group, right next to the kitchen where I was in the path of all of the employees and on top of all that, a very loud radio speaker above my head. I asked for another table and the waiter, or host or whatever his job title is, told me if I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal than I was in the wrong place...I agree. Needless to say my wife and I walked out and never tried their food."
0,"had the porterhouse steak 12.99 special dinner\nsteak was tough, very gristly, not a steak I would want to eat in public because I kept having to pull half eaten bits of gristle out of my mouth and place on plate \nnot worth it"
4,"My youngest saw this place and said he wanted to go.  Reluctantly I said okay (I'm not a huge fan of shaved ice).  This place is wonderful and paired with 110 degrees, it's heaven in a cup.  Prices I felt were great, especially for the sizes.  A small is more than enough of a serving and $2 if you don't add in ice cream or cream.  We have gone more than a couple of times since discovering it and will be going again in the future."
1,"It's not a bad restaurant, if you want some really good sushi go somewhere else, but if you don't feel like finding another place then I would eat here.  I had the dragon martini, which I wouldn't recommend."
0,"This buffet rates just above the Circus Circus one. It's the 2nd worst food I have tried at a buffet in Vegas. Circus being the worst. Give yourself a favor, put $10 on a blackjack table. If you win, go eat at MGM across the street. If you lose, McDonalds for you, and you still get a better meal for the same amount of money.\n\nNever coming here again. I tried everything that they had. It all sucked. Bad. Except the little pink strawberry desert cup things."
0,Hate that I even have to give this place one star! We went there on a Saturday night with a reservation for 11 to celebrate a birthday. Our reservation  was at 7 but we were running a little late so we called and were assured by the very nice hostess that it was not an issue.  When we arrived our table was still available but the waitress seemed bothered by the fact that we were even there. It took a half hour for her to take our order and 1.5 hours for our food to arrive.  When the food did arrive it was either over cooked or undercooked and all was ice cold! Not to mention the fact that we had to go to the bar to order drinks because our waitress would not even look in our direction for the 1.5 hours we waited for our food (bartender was great though).  When we asked to speak to the manager an obviously drunk man came to us from the bar looked at our table and walked away!  Our waitress was very rude and told us the bad service and awful food was a result of us being late for our reservation (although we were told our late arrival was no problem) but based on other reviews I see that this is just the typical service.... Or lack of service that this place provides.  We paid our bills with small tip (although I did not want to leave one at all based on our servers poor attitude) then had to eat again at the fox chapel yacht club.  We arrived at 7:30 and didn't get out until after 10!!!!! Needless to say we will never return and I will share this review with my co workers in fox chapel that look for local lunch spots! Worst experience ever!!!
3,"Rounders is another one of those bars in Vegas with better than the environment food and cheap drinks. They have a nice seating area around the bar with big comfy chairs which is a big plus.\n\nOn the minus, the environment itself is a little mediocre at times. We literally had a catfight between two women bust out here where the bartenders and such did little to react and service can be a little slow at times. You can't really fault a business for the actions of the customers, but I think an attentive staff would have noticed these women were too drunk and screaming at each other for quite a while.\n\nAs for the food in particular, I've had probably 8-10 different things here and most of them are tasty. For example, the lobster quesadilla has big chunks of \""lobster,\"" but it does taste like lobster at least. The steak quesadilla is really good, and my favorite might even be the chili cheese dog. One thing that didn't come out that well was the mini hot dogs. Scooter's version is 10x better. The sliders are average, but the wings are pretty good.\n\nBest of all though is that nearly half the time it seems like they have a happy hour going. All football games and like 2-7pm and 12-3am are happy hours, and all the food above costs around 4-5 dollars when it's half off. It's an absolute steal!"
1,"Meh. \n\nThe place is quite pretty and the menu might be appealing to out-of-towners that don't know about all the other great classic French bistro-style restaurants in Montreal, but if you've been to L'Express, Le Meac or even Cafe Cherrier, this place doesn't even compare.\n\nThe food here was good a few years ago, but I'd have to say that it's mediocre at best now. I had dinner here this weekend and parmentier soup was bland, the steak in the steak-frites was dry and overcooked, and the cod fish was fine but nothing to write home about. And last but not least, the baba-au-rhum dessert was watery.\n\nAlthough the food was a let down, our waiter was friendly and on point, and there is still something kind of nice and nostalgic about the place itself. It's the kind of spot you wish could stay good forever. But sadly, it seems pretty obvious that it's not the case. \n\nThere are tons of French bistro-style spots in Montreal that are WAY better. I'd pass on this one if I were you. \n\nSorry!"
4,"So incredible! I asked a couple questions and they were so good at explaining the why of each question I had. When I was unsure, they gave me several options and were thrilled to help me with whatever I option I chose. They even gave me a \""homemade\"" fix for my radio for free when I wasn't ready to pay for the costly fix!\nI will definitely be returning with all my car needs and can't believe it took me so long to find Terry's!"
0,"I booked my parents through airline shuttle corp and paid for them ahead of time. My intention was to avoid the trouble of getting a cab, explaining where to go, and maybe saved the headache from dealing with one of those cabs (e.g. touring around the city for more $$). \n\nMy parents held the receipt, boarded at Terminal Three Door 1 as instructed and advertised on their website. The Driver however, refused to take them on the bus and asked them to go to door 8! There was no one at door 8. After 5 - 10 minutes of wait, my parents asked an airport staff. The staff directed them back to Door 1 and helped them board on the same bus with the same driver! This is ridiculous! I printed off the receipt, with their names on and the payment confirmation. Why on earth would a bus driver turn down the passengers without an explanation? I printed off the shuttle service and showed my parents the logo for the shuttle corp. They are both experienced traveler, maybe not a lot in the US these days but there is no way for them to confuse between the shuttle buses, especially based on the fact the airport staff directed them back on the bus and the driver in the end took them on. I've left a voice message at the supervisor. I will keep updating on the progress. I am very upset and disturbed at the same time."
2,"I've been here twice now and I'm torn on how many stars to give. The first time I really liked the carwash. It was quick and easy and left my car clean. I also really like all the marketing material they use - the punch card says something along the lines of 'We'd really love to see you again - are we moving too fast for you?' I think it's funny, quirky, and catchy. That's why I went back a second time. The second time everything was just as great as before, except right before my car was about to get dried, it got stuck! The track kept trying to push me forward but I wasn't going anywhere. It was scary! I've never had this happen to me before at any car wash. I kept waiting, hoping an attendant would come or a loud speaker would tell me what to do... but nothing. Then I saw a car coming up from behind. I put my car in Drive and drove off. Maybe this was a onetime occurrence or who knows? I'm a little nervous to go back, but that might change."
3,"I had a great time at Top of the World in Las  Vegas tonight.  The view is spectacular and my husband is always good company for me.  You truly do get a 360 degree view of the city.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Not all are as bubbly as they could or maybe should be (first greeter at the desk take note!).  So I gave them 1 star for first impressions (my star rating is cumulative...so you can earn up to 5 stars but you also lose stars as the meal progresses)\n\nThe decor is old and needs refreshing but the view is all that matters.  They earn a star for the 360 degree view. (If you tend to be at all queasy with motion sickness this is not the spot for you!)\n\nThe food is pricy but what you would expect at a highly rated restaurant (Zagat 23 out of 30 for food; voted LV best restaurant consistently, average 4.5 rating on TripAdvisor, Yelp, UrbanSpoon). Yes, I do my homework before I commit to a dinner that potentially could cost over $200.  The ala carte side dish offerings are adequate, but the chicken (1 option) and seafood choices (4 options) were limited in my opinion. Still they earned a star for having enough variety that we both found something easily.\n\nWe started off with soup.  While we waited the waiter brought a basket of warm bread that was very good.  We enjoyed the view and took some pictures, but after quite some time my husband asked whether they had to go out to get the lobster for my soup, it was taking so long.  About that time the waiter realized our soup had not come out and immediately brought it to our tables with appropriate apologies.  Oops lost a star for that one.\n\nOMG the Lobster Bisque is wonderful.  Some of the best I have ever had.  My husband had the SOTD which was a Vegetable Soup (can't remember the ingredients but it was made with pesto and a grain). Very good also. Add another star.\n\nI ordered: Roasted \""Loch Etive\"" Scottish Salmon with Thai Jungle Curry Foam* for $42 (description says \""from the deep Scottish water sea inlet named \""Etive,\"" high in Omega 3. Kelp noodle salad with Asian vinaigrette, peas and wild blueberries).  The Salmon was grilled perfectly, flakey, moist and seasoned just enough.  I couldn't really discern the spices in the Thai Jungle Curry Foam, but the kelp noodle salad and dressing was tasty.  BUT the ENGLISH PEAS were RAW.  Yes, RAW.  Read that hard, dry and not cooked at all.I tried to mash one with my fork and could not.  I commented to my waiter and he brought a plate to ask me to send a couple to the kitchen for the Chef.  He also tried to squeeze one and it did not give.  A young man from the kitchen came out and apologized and said he would check with the Chef about the intent of the peas. I hoped that he did not INTEND for them to be raw.  When the young man returned he informed me that the Chef prepared the peas this way to give them crunch.  I don't like mushy peas and I do like them crispy and I know my peas and these were not \""crispy\"" they were hard and inedible.  I don't know why but that's the truth. \n\nMy husband had the \""California Mary's Farm Free Range Chicken Breast with Lemon Herb\"" for $44 (included Gnocchi with arugula pesto, English peas, roasted tomato and chicken jus) and the chicken was just DELICIOUS, but guess what! The peas in his dish were also RAW. Minus a star for the peas, but you get it back for the rest of the meal so its a wash.\n\nThe manager took off the cost of our Haricot Verts with Roasted Tomatoes (also very good) and so they won a star back .  Overall my rating is 4 stars.  I will go back but won't make it a \""must\"" on my next visit."
0,"Came on 4th of July around 11:00 for breakfast. It was pretty busy but not too bad. My friends and I had been there before just a couple months prior and we enjoyed the food and its cheap prices which is why we came back. \n\nToo bad I will never go back again.\n\nThe service was the WORST service I have ever experienced. Food was not good at all; and our server served us COLD toast. Not to mention that when we were sat; it took our server at LEAST 15 minutes to come and greet us. When he finally came, he could sense our disappointment and took our orders right away...You would think he would try to make things better but he didn't. We ordered 2 mimosas which took an additional 15 minutes. Ridiculous. Our food finally came out after which seemed like an eternity. When we received our cold toast; my friend had asked if we ALL could get new toast....He rolled his eyes and said yes..and then sent someone over who gave us ONE slice of toast. ?!!? Everything was terrible. We ended up being there an hour and a half!!!!! \n\nIt seemed as if they were understaffed. On a Holiday?? Don't know how that's possible..Whatever the case, I will NEVER be back."
4,"This is my new favorite Asian restaurant in the East valley.  Spice Asian Bistro has something for everyone.  It's a winning concept that includes authentic Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese cuisine.  I'm actually kind of addicted to this place and come at least twice a week lol.\n\nAt first impression Spice' ambiance is clean, professional and warm.  Their service is top notch as the wait staff is always attentive to our needs.  Depending on when you come they have great happy hour specials too.\n\nNow the best part - the food.  One thing you will notice is the quality of the ingredients.    \n\nHere are some of the dishes I've tried.\n\nBo Luc Lac: Vietnamese style tenderloin pepper steak - one of my favorites.  The seasoning is perfect and you'd think your having filet mignon.\n\nPho: One of the best Pho broth and beef in the valley.  No joke, I'm surprised because the broth is the hardest part for most Vietnamese restaurants to get right.  I know because I've been to pretty much all the Vietnamese restaurants in town and even Vietnam twice on vacation.  You'd swear there was some little old grandma in the back making the Pho with their secret recipe.  With the beef tenderloin that comes with the Pho you'd swear they are losing money.\n\nSpice's Signature Chicken: awesome fried chicken fillet!  Great dish for your not so adventurous friends.\n\nCrispy (Chicken or Shrimp) Noodle:  Great dish to share with your friends.  Excellent stir fry on top of crispy noodles.\n\nPad Thai: I have to admit I don't eat as much Thai food as Chinese or Vietnamese but the Pad Thai here is excellent nonetheless.\n\nChicken Lettuce Wrap:  ok this is a must have for everyone.  All my friends that has tried this loved it.  I swear I can eat this all day long.\n\nThere are not a lot of good options for Chinese / Asian restaurants in the east valley so I am glad to have found Spice.  It's a restaurant that will impress both your foodie friends looking for authentic eats or your not so adventurous eaters looking for a better alternative to PF Changs. Yes I know - wide range,  but it works."
0,"Seriously disappointing.  There were three people in our party.  We all got an app, soups and entrees, and none of the dishes were any good.  Three different entrees (ranging from $17.95 to $18.95) ranged from awful to ok.  Portions were *really* small. Service was unfriendly and the vibe of the place was hostile.  There's a sign on the wall that says 'We are not a coffee shop.  If you just want coffee, try Ground Zero a block down the street.'\n\nOne of the worst meals I've had in Madison."
4,"It doesn't get better than this.\n\nRather small space, but the kitchen is always crazy busy, and everything that comes out is incredible. It's a restaurant and a butcher shop that serves top-notch quality meats cooked to perfection. So far, we've just sampled the burgers. The beef is ground in-house and cooked to order; when you say \""medium,\"" it's a true medium. The flavor is outstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed the Block & Grinder burger, as well as the veggie burger (on recommendation by our server). Their lamb and feta burger is superb as well - The Liberty just got ousted.\n\nThe lightly seasoned fries on the side are a nice complement that support the main dish, not just filler. The micro-sized biscuits you get while waiting are addictive like you wouldn't believe. We were also told to try the deviled eggs. Not sure what they do to them, but it's definitely takes them to a whole new level.\n\nThey have a fairly robust beer and wine list that covers every flavor profile you would like. On both visits, the servers have been as knowledgeable about the beverages as they have been about the food, and are eager to share what they know. Everyone we've encountered so far has been remarkably friendly. Even when it's busy, they don't suffer quality of service.\n\nThe only downside is how busy this place can get - weekend waits can be up to 90 minutes. Definitely want to call ahead. Next time I might have to try one of the entrees. I can only imagine how great the steaks are, and I have my eye on the rabbit dish, too."
1,I don't truly think of this restaurant as a two star establishment as the food in general really was mostly very good but too many things went wrong. I had an excellent experience a few years back at the Chef's other restaurant Nob Hill but Nob Hill is gone now so I thought I'd try American Fish.\n\nOne of the things that went wrong was the oil I received with the delicious breads. The oil had a garlic slice that was baked onto the plate so I know it has been threw the dish washer at least once because of how hard it was baked on. We brought this to the attention of our server and he gave us a proper oil with a fresh garlic slice that floated and butter.\n\nBoth starters were delicious. I had a Ceaser Salad that was made with Kale. The Kale didn't appear to be massaged but was still easy to eat with the tasty dressing and cheese. They added two breaded fish called smelt fries that were a very tasty treat. My husband had the shrimp and grits and he said it was very good. I enjoyed my salad but I do note the sign outside said it was made with Romaine and not Kale.\n\nWe receive our dinners and I notice right away it didn't match the description of the menu I was given inside the restaurant. At this time I didn't realize the menu outside differed from the menu the inside was using because they were VERY SIMILAR MENUS. And then THE BIG ONE HAPPENS my husband pulls a wrinkled piece of PLASTIC WRAP FROM HIS MEAL. So we have to tell the server our meal doesn't match the inside menu and we found plastic wrap in the food. So we eat at this point and honestly my fish had a nice wood smoked taste to it but it was slightly overdone but not enough to complain. My husband said his was very dry on one side but better on the other side. He tasted mine and said mine was better than his. For me I thought the roasted smoked were too smokey but they might be great for most people as I only like mild smoke flavors. The inside menu said that I would be getting Corvina with some sort of English peas but clearly I got smoked vegetables and possibly Sea Bass since the outside sign said sea bass. \n\nThe manager stopped by and apologized about the plastic wrap. He said the fish there isn't wrapped in plastic and he just didn't know how that happened. He offered  my husband another plate of food. My husband declined as he was nearly done.\n\nWe received two desserts that came with our meals. Both were delicious and I would recommend either. But since I now know the inside menus differed from the outside menu I can't say for sure what they really were. I don't know if the management didn't change the outside menu to the correct day or if the server just handed me the wrong menu.\n\nWhen the bill came we were told the manager took off our cocktails.\n\nIt's a shame a very nice concept of a restaurant with good recipes.\n\nI would have given 3.5 stars if all went well but based the 3.5 on the preparation of the fish.
0,The last few times being in that store I've noticed that the manager Temple is very rude to his employees and he even had an elderly lady help with his put downs on a young man working there. So disappointing that an adult is willing to put down his employees!!
2,"We first visited this place in August 2009.  We had seen the billboards around town, but thought the name couldn't reflect an authentic chinese restaurant - but gave it a shot anyway.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was an authentic dim sum restaruant - and inside a casino no less!  The dim sum was not the best we've ever had, but it was above average; certainly better than other places we had tried in Vegas up to that point.  Price was reasonable, and we knew we would be back.  Gave it 4 stars.\n\nUPDATE: \nWe returned on 2011-04-16 for dim sum lunch.  Food was still reasonably good, but it seems to have lost a bit in the quality.  They were out of some items we wanted such as har gow (we got there a bit late), and the food overall seemed to lack some seasoning; some of the sauces seemed watered down.  We'll keep coming back to this place for dim sum until we find something better in Vegas, but have lowered the rating to 3 stars.  See my other reviews of other places in Vegas."
0,"Ug.  First of all - whose idea was it to put all the rental agencies 200 miles from the airport???  Secondly, how is it that Hertz had a line an hour long while all the other car rental agencies had no one in line???  Something is seriously messed up here.  Once I finally got my keys, the parking lot number the car was supposed to be parked in didn't exist which led to the fun \""find the rental car\"" game because there was zero staff in the garage to help.\n\nOn the way back to the airport, it took us forever to find the car drop-off location because the signage sucked so bad.  The actual process of dropping of the car wasn't bad but then you had to wait for a bus and drive 200 miles back to the airport."
2,"I don't really get the hype. The food was good and the portions are huge, but this was nothing amazing, particularly not worth the 90 minutes we had to wait for a table.\n\nMy biggest bone to pick was the speed of everything. 90 minutes to get in, okay, I get it. I live in Portland. I'm used to long waits for brunch. But once we sat down, about 15 minutes to get our drinks, another 10 to order, then we waited.\n\nAlmost an hour.\n\nThen our food came. I was hot, good, and big portioned, but nothing mind blowing. Then we waited, and waited. And 20 minutes later we had our check. We put our cards in the little black folder on the edge of the table. Then we waited. About 15 minutes to pay.\n\nAll in, the experience was about two hours too long. If they paid attention to diners, the line would be shorter and I would have headed out happier."
0,"What a terrible place, my girlfriend went in for nail polish and they were out of it on the shelf. Politely asked the employee if they had any and she said yes but it was back in the back in a box and in a baggie. Asked if she could get it and she refused, apparently this poofy haired glasses wearing lazy no waste of space has no customer service skills and is too incompetent for her job. I hope management reads this and fires that girl. You don't deserve to have a job. I cannot believe that this person is allowed in public at all with that kind of attitude"
1,"Beware the \""banquet fee'!  We were actually penalized for making a reservation for 12.  Had we just arrived, we would not have had a 3% charge added on our bills, but not ALL the bills.  I wrote a generally complementary letter to management, but it has been ignored.  I have never had this happen in any other restaurant, and we were informed of the charge after all our lunch orders were in.  Everything was fine but we really don't like being duped.  We never were directed to the general manager, and I haven't heard anything from my letter."
0,"Would you like your chow mein to look nothing like chow mein? Would you like to have zero noodles in your chow mein but actually receive a small white bag of things that look similar to capt. crunch instead? Oh then this is place for you. If you'd like actual chow mein look elsewhere. This has been the weirdest customer service experience of my life. I called after I received my order, which was like..40 minutes later and I live right behind them...like seriously I can jump a wall, walk about 30 feet and there I am. Anyway, that wasn't a big deal I figured it would be that long. I call back after I opened this and saw what I had received. Also, ordered were spring rolls which were not crispy and oily enough where I needed to wash my hands after touching them. I told them this, and they told me that is how their chow mein is.....and I told them I was massively unsatisfied and I wanted a refund. They then told me to come down there and bring the food back. As pissed as I was, this was the last thing I was concerned about. I was then called back by one of the workers stating that they would not give me a refund because I should have known that they make Chow Mein without actual noodles referring to the menu which says \""crispy noodles\""....except there were no noodles....just a white bag of weird small pieces of something they are saying are noodles. I then get into a yelling match with them, let them know they will be taking it back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. I came in there, returned the food and they handed me my money back, I returned the tip for the delivery driver since its completely not his fault that they aren't actually service chow mein. One girl at the front told me \""I needed to calm down, and that if I have illness I should be in a hospital.\"" after that I will never ever order from them again. The ordeal of this entire thing is enough to not only keep me from returning but I will tell everyone I know in this area about it. I would vote them a negative star if I could. The only small amount of customer service in the place is the owner who called me later on and apologized. Unfortunately there was a serious language barrier so I'm not sure he understood what had happened other than a customer was majorly pissed."
0,"So they serve food after 2am?  So does Denny's.  And Whataburger.  And at Denny's they dont make you sit on some sick ass counch that has god knows what on it from its better days at Sigma Chi.  Everyone that has sat on those couches should go get tested immediately.\n\nAre you all so drunk when making the decision to stumble to Mickey's that you dont realize how disgusting it is?  And that you've just PAID COVER to get in there??  What is this cover for?  Obviously not new couches.  Or more bathrooms.  Two bathrooms with one room each doesnt cut it for me.  Because then I have to wait in line to pee, thinking about how I just paid $5 to stand in line and look at ugly people sitting on splooge covered couches.  \n\nDrink specials and the patio when its not 130 degrees might be appealing if the rest of this nightmare wasnt so fresh in my mind."
1,"$28.00 for two people to each have a sandwich, share a drink and share fries. Why does two pieces of bread with one item stuck between it cost so much?"
3,"One of my favorite nightspots in Vegas. Knocking back a few exquisitely-crafted cocktails here while playing a spirited game of spot-the-hooker is my idea of an evening well spent. The lack of a fifth star is due to the uneven service. Sometimes it's great. Sometimes you're waiting 20 minutes for your drinks. All in all, though, a can't-miss for the cocktail lover."
1,"Just because a restaurant has white tablecloths does not mean it has good food but reviewers of Flemings must be so impressed with the tablecloths that they overlooked the taste of food.  Worse restaurant I've been to in a while, and that includes the food I am forced to eat at the airport.   I had  fish, that tasted institutional - something off high school cafeteria menu. It was an insult to the sea.  The service was good, which is why this place got two stars and not one."
2,"Dinner was okay, typical Canadian Chinese food, nothing exceptional, It's edible. The Eggdrop soup was cheap and pretty big protion for $2.50, bit on the salty side though, chicken ball, fried rice and egg roll were okay, The dish, Kam Yin Treasure Nest was interesting, oily but good, overall it was ok food."
1,"This place is great for those that just quit smoking... no, not really.. the cigar smell bleeds through these walls. the food is not that great."
4,Love it! I've only done the heated flow class but it's really amazing and a great environment. Bring a towel!
1,"Been going to this establishment for years; since 1987.  Albeit mostly the original location in NW Phoenix, but I have been to this Mesa location 4 times.  This restaurant is going downhill.  Food is getting worse and the portions smaller.  Further, customer service sucks!  Although the prices are reasonable, the food is mediocre at best.  You are better off eating at the food courts of the Mexican oriented grocery markets - at least the foods there are more authentic and tasty."
1,"My first so far \""Not so good\"" review. \nWent with a Groupon(like) deal and really wanted to try and make a nice dinner out evening with the Fam based on a lot of more than good reviews on here. \nGreeted and sitted promptly. Waitress was nice and friendly and we chatted a bit before we ordered. It went downhill from there... \nThough the atmosphere is nice and clean .. I was not really all that impressed.. Owner, owner's son, wife and granddaughters were there visible and audible (and who knows maybe some other family members). A lot of people will point that as a really cool thing... but for some reason I felt like it was a bit too much... Owners son working as a waiter was going round the tables (did not make it ours, which was quite all right with us) with a little bingo for a chance to win a free dinner - i though a little cheesy.. \nOrdered food and were brought my husband's drink - which was served wrong (vodka/soda on side ordered - brought mixed, a bit more on the ice/soda side)... Anyway - we should have been drinking wine and not hard liquor at an Italian restaurant, right? So... that was no big deal... waited for great food... \nWhat a surprise when food was brought out... Mine and my daughter's were a little more than mediocre (mine - fettuccine with chicken and her's spaghetti with meatballs from the kids menu)... and my husband's was a whole different story. \nHe ordered Lemon chicken - half chicken with roasted potatoes and veggies on the side... We both could swear this was half chicken bought the day before from Fry's or Safeway.... It wasn't even warm enough to fool one that it was cooked right there and then. Potatoes were half cooked and vegetables looked like they were overcooked. He literally had a couple of bites and moved his plate to the side... I had to taste it to make that what he was saying was what he was saying... Unbelievable... We shared my plate and he walked out (NOT happy and still hungry) as I stayed behind to pay the bill. Even with the Groupon I felt like it was too much money we were leaving there for what we got (did not get!) and when waitress came back with the bill and asked how everything was.... I HAD to say something... \nShe brought the owner over and after a couple of trips back and forth for him to find out what happened and 20 min later (husband waiting outside!)... He took my husband's meal cost out of the bill and handed a to go box with a little tiramisu square (complements from the owner?!)... \nWill not go back again... unless I have to be there and someone else is paying the bill (and still might walk out hungry, just like my husband did!). One a second though - I will not go back. Period! \nWill not recommend the place to you... you are better off throwing a Bag of Bertoli in a pan if you crave Italian! \nThe ** are one for the server and one for the appetizer served while you wait for your food... if it wasn't for that ... it would have been no *'s."
3,"Ate here 2x with the fam while visiting Vegas. 2nd time we decided to go with the All You Can Eat, and it was well worth it. If you're hungry, go for this one. They have a large menu, portion is good, price maybe $1-$2 more than what you may be used to. Service starts off slow, but once your first order comes out, everything else will follow. I know we'll be coming here whenever when in town."
4,Best buffet on the strip.  Only been for dinner.  Its huge.  You will need a second stomach to take everything in.  They need better mashed potatos through.  Excellent!  And you will not live hungry.
4,"Ate here recently with a group of six and let me just say we were blown away in every way possible.  \n\nWe had originally intended to come here for the Palazzo's \""Date Night\"" menu but a member of our party had reserved Restaurant Charlie instead of Bar Charlie.  Unfortunately, Bar Charlie was completely booked.  The manager came out to inform us, however, that there had been a cancellation at the Kitchen Table.  At this point I knew we were in from a treat.\n\nFrom the triple amuse bouche, to the diver scallops, to the sous vide wagyu, to the unbelievable desserts.  Every single course was spectacular.  Chef Trotter's commitment to excellence without excessive cream and butter really shines.  Presentation was also incredible, with each course looking like nothing more than a work of modern art on the plate.  Furthermore, each course was delivered by an elegant entourage of six wait staff - perfectly timed - and accompanied each time by a different chef who came to explain and answer questions.  Chef de Cuisine Van came twice and brought us a sharkskin grater to play with!  Where else can you experience this?\n\nHonestly, this restaurant is firing on all cylinders and if you have a chance, you owe it to yourself to try it.   FYI we were told the kitchen table typically books a month or two in advance so get your names on the list now!"
2,"Decent Italian chain. We got the salmon salad, lobster ravioli alla vodka, and the lobster bisque appetizer. Nothing really stood out. But, nothing was bad, either. Lobster bisque had little lobster in it. The bread and olive oil was OK. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant was decent. High ceilings and a lot of seats. \n\nWe went in at 9pm and were out by 10:10pm to catch our 10pm movie. The service was slow at the end (we waited for our credit cards to be taken for 10 minutes), although we had notified our waitress early on. \n\nTastes like a chain, looks like a chain, acts like a chain, so it must be a chain. We were not disappointed, but were not thrilled either."
2,"Don't know what all the hype is about. Kinda pissed they didn't acknowledge my husbands bday. Not asking for anything free but the waiter could have written it on the check... Whatever places do for wow experiences. I not only told them when I made the reservation but also told the girl sitting us it was his bday. My husband is like a little kid on his bday. He likes to be acknowledged. Other than that the salad bar was fresh and good. That was pretty much the best part. The meat was average. The lamb chops were delicious and pretty much all I would eat. The crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e was hot on the top and cold on the bottom. It was almost frozen. No good. The drinks we ordered came out half way when we were done with our food. Won't be coming back here. Try Burtolucci in henderson. Great people, great service and great food. This place me think NOT."
3,"This place is unassuming from the outside, and it's very possible to miss if your not used to the area. i probably drove by it hundreds of times to and fro from MCC and never even considered going here until a local and fellow class mate gave me the heads up. So i step inside fully prepared to be underwhelmed and greeted by goths or pretentious metal brats in black and im immediatley smitten: the loads and loads of rock' n' roll parephenalia and musical ephemera of almost every conceivable genre! The sea of posters kept me occupied for an hour and a half! I was so OVERwhelmed that i vowed to come back with a gameplan in mind. I ended up finding a really cool mini poster of a stevie wonder concert and a giant poster of a sonic youth tour in the NW. So much cool stuff it'd be a shame not to give them a looksee. plus there are ample restaurants in the area so if you get weary you can replenish yourself and head back and continue your search.\nhappy hunting!"
3,"Located inside the Excalibur Casino, this show is surprisingly entertaining.  This show is literally fun for the whole family.  The arena is fairly small so no matter where you sit you will have a good seat.  We actually sat dead center in the front row and we were so close that we were almost hit by dirt thrown up by the horses as they galloped by!\n\nOne great aspect of this show is the Feast!  Our waiter was so good we couldn't take more than a couple drinks from our glasses before he zipped by and refilled them!  Dinner included: tomato soup, Cornish game hen, roasted potatoes, broccoli, a dinner roll and a pop tart shaped apple crisp for desert.  Dinner did not include eating utensils as you are forced to drink your soup from a bowl and eat with your hands like the good ole days!  The food was surprisingly good!  The cornish game hen basically tasted like a small broiled chicken, hot, juicy, tender and seasoned perfectly.\n\nThe show is basically a bunch of josting knights, dancing gypsies and the classic good vs evil battle with a slight twist.\n\nAlthough my girls were highly skeptical including my 12 yr old daughter who texted her friends saying \""we were making her go\"" said she loved the show and it was \""awesome\""  Kudo's to the Excalibur for putting on a great show and meal."
0,"I've always had a mediocre experience here and today was no exception. I went in just to get my polish removed- regular polish, not gel. The gal told me it would be $5 which I thought was crazy but did it anyways because I needed my dark polish taken off so badly, but when I went up to pay the guy charged me $7. It literally took her 1 minute to remove my polish- $7- wtf? So ridiculous. I will not be coming here, ever again, and would not recommend that anyone else does either, unless you want to pay a ton for very basic service."
2,"I'm definitely not in a rush to come back here. Ever. The cute sea creatures deserve five stars for just being themselves, the staff deserves zero, so three stars seem fair. \n\nWhen we arrived, there was some confusion on which way to enter. My party was trying to read the signs as a crabby employee (pun intended) was shooing us off in a different direction, only to find out she made us go the long way to purchase tickets (there was no line). Had she moved out of the way and let us by, we would have been right where we needed to go. \n\nI came with a coupon for $10 admissions for any age, up to six admissions. Kids two & under are free. There were seven in our party, including my two-year-old, so the coupon worked out perfectly for our group. The employee was confused... Or thought we were trying to pull a fast one. She kept asking my two-year-old how old he is. Seriously, lady.... Then she had an issue with redeeming the yelp offer I was given when I checked in for 50% off a guide book. She told us it would be a while, because we had the admission coupon, too, and she'd have to get a different order up and do a search, blah blah blah. Really? We decided to just try the offer with a different employee on the way out and consider it a souvenir, since it really isn't necessary for navigating through the aquarium. Plus, my little ones were more interested in seeing the sea life, not hearing me spew facts at that moment. \n\nThe restrooms were gross. The electronic screens that tell which creatures are in the tank are on a rotation, so if you miss it, you have to wait. Guess it's more feasible than having a million signs for each species. The starfish touch station had no restrooms nearby or even a sink for after the kids were finished. Ew. I did spot a crusty, empty sanitizing pump, though. Not helpful. \n\nOf course, we hit a trainee at the photo purchasing counter. Even with help from an assumed more seasoned employee, it took forever. They both seemed very confused, even after we told them exactly what we wanted to buy from what they had shown us. (Photos are taken in front of a green screen after admission is paid and before a short film is shown and you're let loose into the aquarium. Fun  backgrounds are added and the photos, key chains, etc. are for sale. In the same fashion as typical amusement parks.)\n\nSo, like I said, the sea life they had there was nice and kept the kids' interest. Too much employee confusion and rudeness. Glad we checked it out, but I was hoping for a better experience overall."
0,"Horrible service.  Walked around the men's department for 30 minutes looking for a particular color/style pants.  \n\nDidn't see anyone in the department for a little while and just searched on my own.  About 10 minutes pass by I see an associate.  He doesn't acknowledge me or ask if I need help.  I continues to shop on my own.  \n\nBy the end of the 30 minutes I see he's asked two other people if they needed help.  It took him a while to approach each one.  During the time he asked the other two, I walked passed the associate twice and he walked next to me once.  Never once even acknowledging my presence.  \n\nI guess I'll take my business elsewhere like Armani.  They are always very friendly there."
2,"Harrah's is a great place to stay if you want to save some cash for gambling or shopping but still be on the strip and have access to everything.....it's across the street from Ceasars Forum Shops and Treasure Island, next to the Venitian and close to the Wynn and the Mirage.  \n\nThe hotel itself is pretty outdated but the staff is extremely attentive and friendly.  If you decide to stay at Harrah's I suggest you book a room in the Mardi Gras Tower.  The rooms in this tower have recently been remodeled with nice funishings, comfortable beds, and flat screens in the bathrooms.  STAY AWAY from the rooms in the Carnival Tower-they are outdated, run-down and smelly.\n\nThe pool is small and nothing special compared to the pools at the nicer casinos (but that should be expected).  When we stayed for a night last weekend it was packed and the water looked very dirty-ewww.   So, we just  decided to lay out under the misters that line the upper deck- a nice touch for those who don't want to swim but still want to  stay cool.\n\nWe ordered room service late and it was reasonably priced for Vegas but the food was only so-so.  The Toby Keith bar and grill is kind of fun and the Carnival Court bar is crazy and loud-like spring break is happening there ALL THE TIME. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend staying at  Harrah's but only in the remodeled rooms in the Mardi Gras tower.  It is a good value for the price and you can't beat the location on the strip!"
2,"It's Fridays.\n\nClose to school, quick service and tasty food.\n\nGot the job done, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back."
4,"I visited Montreal in the summer of 2013 during FrancoFolie.\n\nThe staff is friendly, the price is good, and it's right in the middle of everything.\n\nWe stayed in a room where the electricity kept going out (I guess the circuit kept breaking or something). After about the third time, they called me and said they were going to upgrade me to a better (larger) room at no additional charge. \n\nIf I ever come up to Montreal again, I will be seeing if this place has any vacancies."
0,"Be careful. The bartenders will not give you your change back after ordering a drink.\n\nEither they're too drunk, or it's a way for them to get some extra cash into the bar (I'm guessing the latter). \n\nI ordered 2 beers, handed her a 20.00, and she walked away and didn't come back. I had to yell over at her, and she knew right away and gave me the exact change back. So that leads me to think she wasn't thaaaat drunk. \n\nI will not be coming back here."
3,"Moreno's certainly deserves its props in Oaktown for being a pretty damn good Mexican restaurant in Tempe. It's great to know that in a city flooded in the market of \""berto's\"" style fast Mexi-food, there are some places that want to show it's customers a little bit more! \n\nHere are a few tips when eating here:\n\n1. GET THE CHIPS! Seriously, they are fantastic - and they are probable the best chips I've had at a Mexican restaurant.\n\n2. The salsa bar is great, but do yourself a favor and order salsa from the back. It is the best salsa in the whole restaurant guaranteed.\n\n3. Their torta plates are tasty (especially the adovada), filling and cheap! \n\n4. Make sure you relate yourself with the daily specials, they have some great deals!\n\nIf you're by ASU and want some Mexican food, Moreno's is a sure thing."
2,"This was my first Cirque show ever so maybe that's why I was so confused.  Honestly, the entire time during the show I kept thinking, WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON???\n\nMy friends and I got some amazing seats.  We sat in section 106, about 6 rows from the stage (the performers were right next to us when they entered).  Found a great deal online and only paid $99 for those.  I was surprised that they didn't play as many mainstream Beatles songs as I thought they would, many of them I have never even heard of.  Most of the show was a lot of interpretive dance, people running all over the place, stuff thrown everywhere.  It took me a few songs in to figure out there is no storyline, just a live music video. I think I would've enjoyed it more if I knew what was happening the entire time, it was too many things happening all at once.\n\nThere's a weird part where they pull a sheet over the entire audience so you'll get knocked by this giant white sheet.  It's sort of cool when they suck the whole sheet under the stage afterward.  I want one of those helmets they wore while on the rollarblades!"
1,"I had been scouting out the yelp reviews of this buffet for a couple of months, waiting for the next time my friend came into town so we could try it.  We went on the weekend for dinner and payed $40each.\n\nI must say that it was a huge disappointment.  I used to be a fan of the Rio seafood buffet, but it has gone way down in quality over the years so I was really looking forward to getting some King Crab legs at the Bellagio, even though it is chilled and not steamed.  \n\nTo my dismay, the crab was not good.  Both the King & Snow crab had no flavor and some of it actually smelled like it was bad.  But I am not basing my review on the dismal crab.\n\nI had read many posts about how good the Kobe beef, and the Beef Wellington were, and numerous other items that were great, and they just weren't all that good.  \n\nThe \""Kobe\"" beef tasted like dry roast beef.  The Beef Wellington was ok(never had it before), but it didn't knock my socks off.  The Lamb chops were a bit gamey, and I've had lots of Lamb.  One of the best things I've ever tasted was a  Lamb Chop on the Oregon Coast, and this wasnt' even close.\n\nThe sushi smelled foul and I only could muster up the courage to try the tuna, which was about what I would expect at a low dollar buffet. \n\nThe only high point was the Prime Rib and the very large & tasty Peel & Eat shrimp.  The Prime Rib was very good & the au jus was also really good.  The Prime Rib isn't as good as Lowry's Prime Rib, but it is top notch for Buffet Prime Rib.  I've had many disappointments with buffet Prime Rib, and the Bellagio isn't one of them.  \n\nThere were also a couple of vegitable dishes & other sides that were good, but for the price, I expected way more.  The buffet at Green Valley Ranch is a third of the cost, and the quality of the food is much better.  Not as much selection of high end stuff, but when the crab, Kobe Beef, & Sushi all suck really bad, the point becomes moot.\n\nI gave it two stars because between the peel & eat shrimp & the good Prime Rib, I think I got my $$ worth."
3,"Very good food, great lunch menu and affordable all in one.\n\nHad a meetup here with four other guys for lunch today and two of them eat here constantly and kept raving of it.  Nothing short of wonderful here but nothing extremely out of the ordinary from a Chinese restaurant to bump it to a five.\n\nService was excellent and timely, place was very clean, located far south east but I hear there's actually people that live out there these days so that's cool.\n\nLunch menu was pretty large - lots of choices and everybody mentioned that theirs was exceptional food as well.  You get the typical egg drop or hot-n-sour soup prior to the main dish coming out.  Food comes out pretty quick (crackin the whip back there).  Price was pretty cheap - good deal :)\n\nNot sure I'll travel that far south just to eat there but if I'm around that area or need to have lunch meeting with the S.E. SEO boys again - it'll be in my mind to return and try some more good food :)"
1,"Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials (signage, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to do --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?\n\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good news?  It was pretty to look at and well-packaged."
4,"Three times I've been here and three times I've left satisfied. All three dishes were excellent. ( Chicken and broccoli in spicy brown sauce , Pho  and Mekong noodles.) Wonton soup and egg rolls are home made and extra tasty. \n\nHave only been here for lunch. But I'm sure it's just a good for dinner. \n\nStaff is friendly and helpful. Prices are fair."
1,"Overall was not impressed by the food or service.  There was one waitress working while another three were sitting at the bar when I came in, I sat and gave my drink order then had to change it since they only do Pepsi products.  The whole time I was in there I think I saw one of the other workers get up once to do something then sit right back down even when a couple more groups came in.  \n\nI ordered the original special with fries, the food came out pretty fast and you can tell right off the bat it's the same kind of fries you'll get from Harris Teeter next door.  The burger was what I went in for and it was decent but nothing to make me want to go back.  It was pretty much the same burger you would get at Cookout and a little better than Hardees.  \n\nFor $10 including tip I want something a little better than this, I'll probably be sticking to other places for a burger and Davinci's for lunch/dinner in that strip."
0,"Don't bother coming back (again). I hadn't been here for 10 years after they made me and my nine guests wait four hours for a table (yes we had reservations). Decided to give it another try with a party of four... it was bad. The service was slow and the staff inattentive, two of main entries were gone by 7:30pm (lobster & tuna). The food we received really unremarkable the oysters (old), the trout (blah), the scallops the same, the marlin (tough on the outside, raw on the inside), & the pasta (coated in some weird spice). Save yourself the trouble and get seafood somewhere else."
4,"We had to drop off our foreign exchange daughter off last Sunday (we miss you!), and can I say, the place looks pretty damn good. I guess I'm so used to seeing the old Terminal 2 (which was where all my flights took off) that I've forgotten what a nice terminal actually looks like. Very clean, everyone was very helpful in giving directions, and fairly easy access from the parking garage. 5 stars for everything we went through. I'd try and take off one for the employees at Virgin Airlines who were late, but it was only 5 minutes, so I'll let it slide. :D"
1,"Had this bookmarked for a long time. And since my daughters orthodontist is not far from here, we stopped by on our way home. \nIt is very simply decorated and clean inside. There was only one worker that I saw and it was early evening on a Monday so maybe they get busy later or on different days.\nThere were not many choices in the dessert case. (picture)\nThere is a nice covered patio for eating during warmer weather. \nWe purchased the family pack which is supposed to come with salad AND 2 sides. well half way home (30 minute drive) we discovered it was FORGOTTEN. DRAT!!\n\nAnyway once home we opened our containers- she showed me at the place and I was a bit disappointed that the whole chicken was already cut into 1/4s.  i guess I was expecting something like the whole chicken you can get at the grocery store for around $6 that is left whole. And the 2 sides were in 4 different little containers (picture)\n\nNOW- i am picky about my coleslaw so i asked to taste it first before ordering as a side. It was lightly coated with a mayo type stuff that had a tangy sweetness to it (reminded me of miracle whip) although it was good, it didn't knock my socks off. So i ask if the red rice is made in house, she said yes.  WELL..........................\nred rice is something close to uncle Ben's type rice with a funky flavor that I must say reminded me of cardboard.\nThe other side of mac and cheese  took one bite and spit it in the trash- wax like glue cheese coating that did not taste anything near cheese (this is the south- we know mac and cheese).\nNow I really wish I had gotten my salad because all I got to eat was the chicken.\nI am a white meat eater and the chicken was a little dry- not super dry but you could tell it was made early in the day and had sat for a while. The seasoning is nice, but amazingly oily skin (where all the seasoning is) . It would be great if they could inject it to prevent the drying out as well as getting the flavor into the meat itself. \nI may return to try another item on the menu- but as far as getting the chicken i think I will just stick with my local grocery store since I can call ahead and find out what time they will come off fresh and just pop down the road. \n\nThe variety on the menu is great- but hopefully better than the sides we received. OH I asked if the green beans were seasoned at all and she said no- so that makes me think they are canned- and who doesn't have a can of beans in your pantry collecting dust anyway. If i do return I will be sure to get a side like fries or a baked potato since that would be hard to screw up.\nCHEERS!"
4,"If Las Vegas is about excess, a great way to splurge is at Jean Philippe.  If you're particularly friendly, you can meet some great people while standing in line here. And the day I visited, they were quite busy but it was ok as a nice Texan lady and I oohed and aahed over some of exquisite delicacies in the pastry case. \n\nI kick myself now as I should have bought some Macarons and chocolate that were in gift boxes along the walls, because the thought of the decadent treat I enjoyed there puts me back in my cloudy state of desert bliss. There is limited seating inside so I took my treat to a table just outside JP, right by the windows overlooking the pool.\n\nThe Bellagio was a crazy mess of tourists that day, but each bite of the dessert trio sent me into a state of total relaxation.  The dessert trio comprised of a mini creme brulee (with the cutest little silver plastic spoon), a raspberry French Marcaron, a Chocolate cake pop with a bit of nutella and caramel.  All served on top of thin plank of milk chocolate. This is so rich, but so awfully good, every bite to be savored.  The flavors so delicious and fresh, textures are perfect.  Well-executed in every way.\n\nService is friendly. Take some time to check out the world's largest chocolate fountain in the glass case."
0,it was hella dumb. i hated this experience. i wish i got my money back and the two hours i spent in line to get in. it was not scary fun or worth it. i didn't go in gates of hell bc of all the bad reviews but i did go in the other two houses. i won't be coming back to any of their haunted houses ever again.  and the owner or watever of this place brought in all his friends to cut in line in front of us all who had been waiting.  he had his buddies comin in n out. never coming back.
1,Just like its name nothing is special about this place. It's in a casino so its overpriced and low quality. There is no wow factor and the buffet is not the world's largest. I would stick to off the strip for Indian. A  fast food indian gourmet with live entertainment and modern deco would have worked better. No signature dishes and the bar is small and hidden and nothing special. I would have made it into bhangara bar with fusion tapas.
4,Loved it. Grocery/small restaurant.... 7.99 for the non veggie combo plate. It was great portion. Food taste great. I will definetly be back!
1,"What made this buffet great was our wonderful table attendant. We has to pay $20 for the mimosa brunch, and the food was sadly not worth it. But our lovely attendant kept refilling our mimosa flutes within a minute of being empty. She was funny and perky, and we left her a nice tip.\n\nWe spent an hour or so just walking back and forth to try to force feed ourselves $20 worth of crappy food, which was very hard. But all the boys in my party seemed to be in heaven as they piled their plates high with fried everything. I tried a bunch of things but they were all very cafeteria quality. The only things I enjoyed were the shrimps and cocktail sauce, which I stuffed my face with, and the mashed potatoes. \n\nOh well, lesson well learned. But thank you to our wonderful waitress!"
4,I first came here with coworkers for lunch and we eventually continued to come here for our Mexican food fix. The waiters are very attentive and spoiled us with their delicious chips & salsa. The waiters do not hesitate to give us more chips after we finish our first basket. The food was fresh and fairly priced for the portion. The tables & silverware were clean and the ambience is very casual. I can imagine this place great for birthday celebration. I will definitely be coming back to explore more of the menu.
0,"I've been to their other locations and by far the Henderson Baby Stacks has no sense of urgency and horrible customer service. First, is it unprofessional to be chewing gum while on the job. Second, it took quite awhile to get asked for coffee. In additional, a refill while waiting 30 min or so for our food. Last, the cashier had bad customer service... No thank you, please come back again, nothing. Their staff needs to be trained on customer service or management just needs to get a new set of staff. I rather drive to centennial, buffalo, or flamingo for better service. Yes, it is that bad."
4,"I really enjoyed this place and I'm really happy that I chose the Hash House A Go Go over the buffet in Harrah's. They give huge portions and I'm honestly surprised that I regretted ordering the side of potatoes halfway through my meal. The pancakes are huge, so if you feel put off by the fact that you only get one with your meal-don't. My girlfriend took a slice of mine- when I say slice I am comparing it to that of a pizza- and I still couldn't finish the damn thing. But I tried, oh lord tried, because their homemade strawberry jam made every bite as good as the last.\nThe service was top notch and our waitress made it her duty to make sure we were pleased. At one point she was pissed as she looked for the busboy but stopped what she was doing when I asked for another cup of coffee.\nThere's a buffet everywhere you turn in Vegas and you're on vacation so don't waste your money on a Denny's breakfast you can get at home. Check out Hash House A Go Go and you will not be sorry."
3,"Well, Squid, I gotta tell yuh... this CVS must have really changed a lot after you were there!\n\nI too got upset with Walgreen's.  That's why I came here.  I'd prefer to do business with a local pharmacy, but I want a Pharmacist available 24/7 (it's just a Psycho-Ceramic thing (for the uninitiated Psycho-Ceramic means I'm a Crack Pot)).\n\nThis store isn't as nice as doing business with a local, but the people are friendly, and there's merchandise on the shelves, and the folks here know where it is every time I ask.\n\nSo, all-in-all, for a national chain, it's quite good."
0,We came for breakfast. I got the pancakes. What I received was the frozen silver dollar pancakes you get at the store. Complete with frozen centers. The entire plat was cold. \n\nI had high breakfast hopes. Do yourself a favor and avoid it.
3,"Free picture with a million bucks, free slot play.  I love downtown."
1,I love the Brand Nathan's I mean who doesn't. I have had Nathans at the Venetian before and it was way better but this Nathan's is in an airport so I would think that would be why. The food is still good just wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it. Love Nathans though!!
1,"If you want to gorge yourself on a shitton of food, then this HHAGG is your place.\nLocated inside a maze of a hotel (I'll give them the fact that they're remodeling) we are seated in a strange room of booths. The interior is dim and uninviting.\n\nOur waiter was alright, but seemed a bit frazzled. He kept repeating the items I was ordering with different names than what I was reading off the menu. He also gave an air of irritation because I was just listing off the orders for everyone at the table.\n\nThis place is the perfect example of quantity over quality.\n\nAlthough the food wasn't bad, it wasn't stellar and definitely not food that I'd recommend to others or return for. Sometimes having two huge heaping mounds of smoked salmon on giant biscuits and mashed potatoes is just TOO much. Even when shared amongst two people.\n\nThe sage fried chicken was moist, but lacking in flavor. There was nothing special about the dish. I didn't taste any sage, the syrup was regular ole maple syrup. \n\nThe style of hash was boring. Shredded dry meat. Potato cubes. It didn't hit the spot at all. And the gigantic looming biscuit was dry and brittle and really just a sponge to soak up any grease.\n\nFor our party of 7, we were seated within 10 minutes on a Saturday morning around 9am.\n\nMaybe other locations in the chain are better, but this one I will not be returning to."
3,Now called Bobby's Bagels and all is delish!\n\nHow does one create a new site for Bobby's Bagels?\n\n:-)
4,"I love this place. Their buffalo chicken wraps (and wings) have become my favorite. Lots of beer choices for the beer drinkers. Lots of TVs if that's what you like to do while you eat/drink. I've been for lunch during the week while working and also on the weekend when I've had more time to relax and just enjoy the meal. I've never felt rushed, though service has always been prompt.\n\nI've never sat in the upstairs section but they have tons of room on both levels. Waitresses are always very friendly, even when not 'perfect' in their service. I'll be going back again and again..."
3,"It's been a couple of years since I've been here so i got excited when i was asked to lunch. I ordered asparagus bisque and sesame crusted tofu salad with ginger carrot vinegrette. The bisque needed salt, good thing Coca Cafe is not one of those pretentious places that do not have s&p shakers readily available. Everyones palette is different, it just makes no sense to me...a little salt really livened up the creamy asparagus, my only complaint is that the spoon was too big! Oh my goodness! I had to unhinge my jaws to fit that spoon inside my mouth! It was bigger than the slice of bread they gave me.\n\nIm sorry, back to the food. I absolutely love anything with ginger in it, so i thought my salad was very tasty. My friend ordered an omlett that came with fried potatoes and a fresh fruit cup. While she throughly  enjoyed the omlett, she commented that potatoes were pretty bland (thank goodness for those teeny-tiny salt and pepper shakers) they even required hot sauce and ketchup, but hey! Those potatoes were really the only disappointing item, everything else was delicious"
4,Not many afordable lunch options out there that consistently have great food but Taylor Street is one of them. \n\nChicken is awesome!
4,If u want a burger that will change how u look at quality n pricing this is the place begs everything unlike 5guys In n Out the big chain restaurants they put love care n their food u leave feeling good
0,"DO NOT EAT HERE.\n\nIf I could give this place no stars whatsoever, then I would. (1) Our waitress was slow and forgetful. They were either understaffed or overbooked but neither is a good excuse for poor service. (2) My husband found a women's hair in his salad bar items and/or baked into the cheese biscuit, which we *might* have overlooked BUT... (3) A mouse was running in and out of the wine cellar area behind us and into the restaurant - a mere 20 feet away from the kitchen. \n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, the staff and manager's reactions were horrifying: First, they did not seem to care or mind that a rodent was running loose. It was almost as if they knew about the problem before it happened. (2) I had to actually persuade the manager to take care of our bill. Unfortunately, his solution was to only slightly discount our meal rather than completely comping it. We're not the type of couple to ever ask for freebies - I even offered to pay for the wine, hoping to suggest that we were not inclined to pay for a meal after such a horrifying experience. To make matters worse, we saw the hair and the mouse after finishing eating. Had we seen it before gorging on food, we would have simply finished our wine and left. What an awful feeling to realize after ingesting an entire meal that your food was prepared in wholly unsanitary conditions - not to mention the kick in the face of shelling out $100+ after everything that happened. \n\nThis was a completely unacceptable meal experience. Before this all happened, we discussed possibly going back and/or taking friends or family but we will NEVER step foot in there again. Disgusting.\n\n**SINCE WRITING THIS REVIEW, THE ALLEGHENY HEALTH DEPARTMENT DID AN INSPECTION: http://hdas01.achd.net/reports/rwservlet?food_rep_insp&P_ENCOUNTER=201401230037\n\n**Texas De Brazil corporate office have been unresponsive."

3,I have been shopping here for years.Martin in the guitar dept is awesome!He has treated me like a good long time costumer should be treated!All though I do miss the smaller local guys I think this outfit does a great job overall.
0,"Rip off. The food was crap. Tasted like some kind of chain restaurant crap that I could have gotten at Olive Garden. For the price, I was VERY disappointed. This place is a must miss!\nThe chicken parm was just a piece of chicken with sauce and cheese slapped on it with a high price tag. Save your money and go elsewhere."
2,"This is a happening joint for happy hour and beyond. I've walked by the huge windows while downtown before and been amazed at how many people were drinking it up inside. Friday night, I finally made it inside. \n\nI was disappointed that they used \""mojito mix\"" for their seemingly very popular mojito - but at least they had freshly mashed mint. The martinis are generous, but you pay the price for them. Enjoy your measly $1 off at happy hour during the week, but I don't blame them. Why have a better happy hour when you're already making money hand over fist? \n\nThis is a fun place to hang out but expect to spend lots of money if you stick around. The atmosphere is probably the best for a downtown bar, but the crowd is surely on the older side. \n\nUnfortunately, they still allow smoking, but the place is big and airy enough that it's not so much an issue.\n\nOverall, I will definitely be heading back to Bossa Nova on another night - it has a very nice atmosphere. But I'll be sticking to one drink at a time."
4,"Look down into the basin or you'll miss it!\n\nThank goodness my hubby looked over the mounds of gravel to look down into the basin to find this gem of a dog park within walking distance from our home. The dog park is not only full of healthy grass and each section is HUGE. By the time our dog ran to the edge of the fence he was a tiny dot in the distance. \n\nWhat I really like about this place is that they built the benches down the center of the dog park for us humans. I like this because a lot of the other dog parks that I've gone to have seating on one edge of the park and if your dog runs to the other side and makes a #2 you'd never be able to see him unless you followed him around the park,...thereby increasing your chances in stepping on said 'poo'. \n\nSo happy we found this place and we will most definitely be regulars here!"
0,"Gold Rush Jewelry Design, owner, Alfonso is extremely unfriendly and rude.  Before you buy anything at his shop, be absolutely sure you like your merchandise and unlikely to change your mind about it BECAUSE once bought your merchandise and left his shop, there is NO after sale service whatsoever.  He refused to replace the off color diamonds in my ear-rings that he has set.  He told me he could do nothing about it.  I will NEVER go back to his shop again !!"
3,"It is in the weirdest area!  But the food, good!  Had the shrimp and carne asada tacos, the beef was a little tough, but the shrimp tacos were yummy!  Best part, eating all the guacamole they had out, yummy!!  It's worth going back ::-)"
0,"I've heard through the grapevine that they are now CLOSED, due to various violations, including but not limited to: underage drinking, illcit drug use, excessive nudity.\n.......\nI'm sure they'll be back"
0,"My LAST visit entailed an extremely aggressive bouncer. I have the bruises to prove it! It was as if this guy was looking to kick someone out. Rude & unprofessional manager taking the bouncer's side without so much as asking the patron's opinion. If you want to drink in a bar where all the staff have chips on their shoulders, be my guest."
2,"Buffets.. A place to binge on almost any kind of food you can imagine. You would think almost every buffet on the Strip deserves a 4 or 5 star rating, but there are exceptions.\n\nLet's start off with the fact that the waiting line is located super close to some of the dining areas. My group was seated near the entrance of the buffet and the line got ridiculously long that some of the people were standing right in front of us. Normally this wouldn't really be that much of a problem, but it does when they are standing in the way of me and my path to food.\n\nIts your average buffet with food ranging from mediterranean to asian to mexican to seafood. I'm a seafood lover so I will ALWAYS find myself heading straight to the crab legs ;) What can I say? I want to get my moneys worth. This buffet has 2 small trays with crab legs =( It's quite depressing when I'm use to the World Carnival Buffet at the Rio having a HUGE selection on crab legs. I still found myself getting 2 plate servings though. If there's crab legs, I'm eating it.\n\nNothing else was really appealing to me. I had some of their 3-cheese ravioli which I found too heavy even for italian food. The pesto alfredo was alright - nothing worth raving about OR putting down. I guess the last thing I can add about this place is it is poorly lit. It's a little dim for my liking, but that's a personal preference.\n\nAll in all, this buffet may just be a pass for me. There are better buffets out there with higher quality in food and bigger selections."
4,"If you need your car done up right, THESE ARE YOUR GUYS!  I had my brothers car done today.  Now, when i say this car was toe up, I MEAN IT.  Seats were brown, carpet was the same.  TOTALLY SHOT!!! I figured we would have someone out to handle it as best as possible, say 50% of the stains removed.  I was totally wrong!! Gannon came out and made it look brand new.  They were on time, nice, guys that I plan on having do my mothers car.  If you need your car to look new, these are your guys.  Fair price, great work, and friendly....PLUS...they are Arizona born and raised.  Gotta love that. \n\nThanks again Gannon....I will be in touch again soon."
4,Oasis orthodontics is amazing!!! From the minute you walk in everyone is so helpful!! Carol the office coordinator is awesome!! She is truly a gem!! Dr Day handled our very difficult orthodontic situation with our daughter so amazingly!! We are for once encouraged with an orthodontist!! This practice was a God send!!! Thank you! Thank you!!
3,I have always enjoyed my stay at the Flamingo.\n\nIt's a bit old but the rooms were upgraded and they been working to make the place look better. The casino is a bit old style and small compare to the mega casinos. My GF likes to stay here because she doesn't get lost. We were given a free GO suite for our stay and it was very nice. The gift basket was a nice touch from the casino host.\n\nThe show room is a bit small also but no complaints. The pool is one of the nicer one in my opinion\n\nI have good luck here.
1,"We went here with our family and the server was very rude. He tried persisting we need to order more dishes. When we said no he said I don't care, just order. With service like that we got up and left without giving them any business. Go to another Korean restaurant on Spring Mt Rd. There are too many to choose from! Avoid this place!! The servers are punks!"
2,"Buffet Deal!  Seems some of the desserts are sort of hidden so do a full scan of the area before selecting your dessert.  The meats upstairs in the buffet are almost as good as downstairs, I bet.  Of course, you are not going to get a steak.  But the roast is more than 1/2 price upstairs in the buffet."
4,The owner is absolutely fantastic! I came in the night before my wedding this past week. The spray tan worked wonders. Just like he recommended I had an even and light glow that was perfect for the big day and the days following. I felt completely comfortable and relaxed. Thank you SOOOO much!!! Don't go anywhere else!!
4,"The food at a Passage to Indian is PHENOMENAL, it is my favorite Indian spot in Charlotte. Every dish is flavorful and fresh. Their buffet is first rate and very reasonably priced. At lunchtime, they are always packed to the gills. I definitely recommend eating there."
4,My boyfriend and I had the best time. We had the top seats and loved the show.  It's breath taking. We paid $180 and was well worth it. Their popcorn is delicious as well.
2,Looks like the staff attitudes to working here have been the main concern for previous yelpers but I didn't find much to fault when I popped in for a coffee the other day. Big smiles all round. Coffee however was baby bath-water warm and and pretty run of the mill. Seems every second shop in bruntsfield these days is of the coffee variety and I wonder where  it will all end. I'll be taking my pennies back to the chocolate tree in future.
2,"We had dinner there tonight.  The food was ok, we got our food pretty fast, but follow up wasn't too good.  There was a loud whining noise from the back that went on for 15 minutes or so.  When that was over, there was a burning smell.  Not terribly appetizing.\n\nI may try it again to see if the soup is ok.  My wife won't."
3,"Been going to Lake P since the old Wadell Dam days. Night & day difference between then and now. Two marinas with restaurants, who would have ever thunk it? \n\nThere is room to spread out, even on the weekends. There are plenty of boat ramps with plenty of parking, so launching and parking are rarely an issue. \n\nA common problem which is not unique to Lake P, is the number of boaters who have no clue what they are doing. And, of course you will get the drunk idiots who generally congregate in Humbug Cove on the weekends in the afternoons. If you are traveling as a family, avoid Humbug on the weekends. \n\nIf you can play hooky from work, weekday mornings are the best. The wind usually doesn't come up until after 11:00 and it's easy to find your own cove with flat water for skiing or wake boarding. And on weekdays there is no waiting for a table at Dillon's at Scorpion Bay which is by far the better of the two restaurants on the lake. \n\nAs far as the comments about the fluctuating water levels, this is an annual progression of the water which if you go year after year makes it very predictable. It starts high in the spring and slowly is drafted down throughout the summer. They seem to do an excellent job at marking underwater hazards, and common sense does go a long ways. \n\nA word about the quagga muscles: they are an invasive water pest which have taken root in Lake P. If you frequent Lake P and you want to go to another lake you really need to THOROUGHLY clean your boat including the bilge and cooling system This cannot be stressed enough how important it is to stop the spread of these invasive creatures. They have the potential to wreck the excellent fishing that Lake P has become known for and they can do the same to other lakes. And, unfortunately, there is no known method to eradicate them."
1,"This breakfast buffet at the Flamingo normally costs about $20 or so, but we got complimentary buffet vouchers so luckily didn't pay anything besides tip.  It isn't bad for breakfast, but definitely NOT worth $20!\n\nAmongst their selections was an omelet station, crepe station, shrimp cocktail, smoked salmon, bagels, muffins, danishes, fresh fruit, oatmeal, donuts, cookies, chocolate fountain where you can dip fruit, scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, sausage and bacon, and some other common breakfast items.\n\nI would come again if it were free, but otherwise.. I'd skip it and find a better use for my money!"
1,"I'm a little worried this place might not be the cleanest of places and I want to kick myself for not looking into other birth control centers before making my appointment. The staff was friendly enough but there are extremely long wait times which seemingly could be better managed by scheduling certain types of appointments together and regular appointments at other times as there seems to be only 1 actual doctor that works there so the medical assistants call you back and move you from room to room, to waiting room, and back to exam room.... but what do I know. Anyways, I had a simple blood test done from a  finger prick and a day later my finger is throbbing, red, and inflamed which indicates an infection. This was just a tiny prick from a diabetic blood testing pen, which I've had done before without any issue so I don't know why my finger is still hurting unless it is infected. I really hope they aren't reusing dirty needles and wish I had waited to see a doctor until my new insurance kicks in next month. I'll give an update if my finger gets better. UPDATE: I squeezed the hell out of my finger and poured rubbing alcohol on it. It cleared up by the next day. Phew!"
3,"Delicious, different, \""real\"" ice cream. I had a banana split. Taro, pralines & cream, and pistachio. I had never had taro before, it was good, but probably a little too different for my palate. The praline Ice cream was amazing, reminded me of New Orleans, the pistachio was vibrant.\n\nThe owner was nice and welcoming, the treat was served on a silver tray which I thought was nice. My only complaint is that the banana was a bit overripe, which I found a bit overpowering, others might have liked it, but I have to rate for myself. \nImo, they probably need to fit one more table in here. I'll be back"
3,"I've been watching this place under construction for a while, and was glad to have the opportunity to pick up a late lunch to go today.  I wanted to try a variety of their options, so I got a 2 enchilada plate with chicken with green sauce and short rib with red sauce, as well as an order of chips with hot salsa on the side.\n\nThe food was fantastic.  I was a little skeptical of how they were going to pull off the cheese part in a to go order (my favorite part of enchiladas is the melted cheese on top!) but by putting the enchiladas in the oven right in a foil to go dish, the cheese was melted perfectly!  Both meats were tasty and high quality, and the sauces were savory and amazing.  The chips were clearly homemade and the salsa was plenty spicy but also flavorful.\n\nI took off one star for an ambiance issue - it was SO loud in there with all of the stone/metal surfaces that it was hard to hear and speak to the line cooks to place my order without shouting and leaning a bit toward/over the super high glass partition.  A little bit of insulation for noise reduction would do wonders.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try the cornbread and mashed potato enchiladas, as well as the chicken tortilla soup!"
0,"Went there for years and loved it. Went there tonight and  while the website is the same, there is a sign on the door under new management with a new name of AAA. This was the first time I had General Tso's chicken with chunks of pineapple and onions in it. Not sure what it was but it was definately not General Tso's. Also they no longer give white rice with entrees if you get a family combo. Pretty cheap if you ask me and it was enough to piss me off never to go back again. I called them and told them they forgot our white rice, they told me they no longer offer it. How can you be using the same web site as the old restaurant but not honor what is on it? Menu clearly says white rice and fried included. Also, cream cheese wonton'sare much smaller and tasted stale. Huge dissapointment and we won't be returning. Very sad as we loved the old China Joy."
2,"Not the worst airport but certainly not the best.\n\nThe biggest issue with this place is the layout. The terminals are difficult to navigate between and the airport just has a dated feel to it. The biggest plus is that it has plenty of seating and power plugs so waiting around is easy.\n\nI'm not sure when they redid the rental car center as I hadn't been through here in a couple years, buts it's way nicer than the old one. I also like that the staff are very good on the shuttles unlike most airports where they barely are willing to answer questions let alone load and unload bags."
2,"Can't say I've ever been a fan of Hot Dog on a Stick. I wasn't ever really into corn dogs. So this chain has never been on my list.\n\nBut they do make a tasty limeade.\n\nUntil I heard about this Hot Dog on a Stick outside of a mall, I was mostly oblivious to the notion that Hot Dog on a Stick pretty much only existed inside mall food courts. So to now have a location not only outside a mall, but with a drive-thru? It's like a Hot Dog on a Stick fan's wildest dream come true.\n\nAnyway, if you're familiar with their product, it's the same stuff. When I went through their drive-thru, I guess it took a long time to get my food because they gave me some free fries for the wait. That was a nice surprise."
4,"F&F is not a restaurant; it's a way of life.\n\nI went to college in Pittsburgh, and there is NOTHING like F&F's half price Late Night experience. F&F is not the only place that does the half price Late Night thing, but it may as well be, for me.\n\nAfter 11 pm every night, most of the menu is half price. You do have to get there early (10:30 ish on Fri/Sat/Sun) to put your name on the list, but for students, standing outside and chatting with your friends is part of the experience.\n\n(Edited to add: Don't forget to tip on what your full bill would have been!)\n\nMy faves include the sweet potato fries, baked brie (!!!), Smashed Potato pizza, and turkey or buffalo burgers. I've heard they have amazing beers (but I don't drink) and I know they've got some fantastic desserts (my fave was the bread pudding which is gone now, but the brownie and apple turnover dishes are delish too).\n\nThey also have a surprisingly good brunch, and for the record, the basement is much less loud than the upstairs.\n\nEvery time I go back to Pittsburgh, I make sure F&F is on the agenda. Like I said, it's not just a restaurant."
2,"I know the owners of this establishment.  Well my parents do.  It's more like a fast food type of Korean place.  Nothing great to me.  However, it's not terrible enough where I would NEVER eat there again, but I'd just prefer better Korean places."
3,Love: skinny Carmel latte~ Carmel java chip frappaccino ~ egg salad sandwich ~ Caprese panini \nThe rewards program also offers decent perks.
1,"I was not impressed with this place. The service was not very fast and the wings were not tasty at all. The sauces, even though I went with the Caribbean jerk, tasted very much like Buffalo sauce. They have a million sauces...well not really but there's a ton. Consider this strictly a carry out or delivery place. You do not want to dine in here.\n\nI also was not a fan on how they price their wings. You order by the pound...who does that? I don't know how many wings are in a pound. Normal places usually price by number of wings. These guys price the same as Buffalo Wild Wings but are no where near the quality.\n\nI guess if you're smoozing for some bar time food, this will work if you're drunk. On the plus side, they deliver too. Overall, I probably won't be going back."
4,"On a chilly night got a table on the patio. Heat lamps kept it comfortable. Had a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. Told the waiter of my wife's gluten allergy and he said \""don't worry, we'll take care of it\"".  They swapped out the walnut date bread on the cheese board with some rice flour crisps that were excellent. I had the oyster cream soup, superb. We both had salmon, mine in a spinach salad and hers on a bed of Yukon gold potatoes and onions. Both were awesome. We shared a very good bottle of Ros\u00e9 and the bill came to only $108. Service was attentive yet inconspicuous. Considering the setting, quality, service and price, I have to give this 5 stars, it's a fantastic option for a romantic meal in Vegas at a reasonable price."
3,"Monday Sierra Nevada $2.50 & Half Price Wines, Selected List\nTuesday Drafts $2.50\nWednesday Half Price Wines, Selected List\nThursday $3.00 Sam Adams Octoberfest\nFriday $2.50 Corona & Corona Light\nSunday $6.00 Mimosa & Bloody Mary Bar\n\n$2.00 Domestic Beers All Year Round!\n\nDropped in Sunset Grille this morning for brunch, took a seat at the comfy bar.  The door was propped open, it was a spectacular morning.  Precisely on the stroke of noon, a carafe with a shot of vodka appeared for the bloody mary bar. $6.00 bloody mary  at 12:01p never hurt any body.\n\nWe shared a huge breakfast of ham, bacon, Neese's sausage and sausage gravy topped with three eggs over easy and a side of Anson Mill's stone ground grits. Food was good, a little on the salty side, but what can you say about comfort food, sometimes salt is present.\n\nThe menu seemed pretty basic and a reoccuring theme between Mac's, Icehouse and Sunset Grille. Service was great. Great patio and plenty of drink specials."
1,"The sommelier was outstanding, recommending a lovely red and a superb white wine for our two tables. Our servers were friendly  but a little lacking in attention.  Maybe it's because we had two tables, a total of 15 people, but we had a reservation weeks ahead of time, so they should have been prepared for us.  I did enjoy the wine, as well as the bread and olive/cheese plate brought to the tables when we were seated.  From there it went downhill....\n\nI had the burrata as an appetizer salad and unfortunately found it too salty for my taste.  The overabundance of sun dried tomatoes overpowered the delicate flavor of the ricotta and mozzarella. My entree was a simple whole wheat spaghetti primavera which was as disappointing as the salad.  The pasta was too al dente, almost crunchy, and there were very few vegetables in the dish.  I was going to say something to the waiter when he came by to check on us but he never did.  When a young lady came to remove the plates at the end of the meal, she asked if I was done and if I wanted a box to take the remaining pasta with me.  I did not want a box and I mentioned my dissatisfaction with the meal.  I don't know if she said anything to the waiter, but he never came to my table or said anything to me.  \n\nThe next morning I mentioned to a colleague that I hadn't been impressed with the dinner and he expressed disappointment with his pasta dish as well, although I don't remember what he had. He did say the sauce was \""awful.\""\n\nTo be fair, several others in our party said that their meals were quite good, although most did say the pasta, whether side dish or entree, was not stellar.  My friend who had the chicken parmigiana raved about it, and another friend who had linguine clams said the clams were very tasty.\n\nPersonally, I would not go to this restaurant again as there are others in the Red Rock Resort that are better.  I'm also a bit disappointed that I completed a survey for the resort and told them about this dismal meal.  No one from the resort contacted me (I said they could), which makes me think no one bothers to actually read the surveys....."
2,"With 10 million steak houses in Vegas, this place is just ok. Nothing remarkable about the meat or accompaniments.  Its overall very heavy.  And planet hollywood sucks so ya."
4,This place has the best pizza I've ever had besides Keste and Paulie Gs in NYC.  Wood fired greatness.  Expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar.  FANTASTIC red sauce and olive oil.  Not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection. A gem in Pittsburgh.
1,"I was looking for a new dry cleaner so I gave Polo Cleaners a shot based on the positive reviews. I was disappointed by the high prices - $5 to dry clean a man's dress shirt, $7.50 for a blazer and $12.50 for a two piece suit (pants/jacket). The high prices might have been justified for same day service, but it was standard two day service."

2,one of the cutest coffee shops i've been to. the staff is so warm and friendly! i ordered a soy latte. the foam was really chunky and just wrong. but after scooping that out it tasted really great.
2,"I'd walked past Zucca many times in the past and always made the same subconscious comment - \""I must go in there, it looks cool.\""\n\nWell, finally, after all this time, I went there - but only after being invited along by someone else! \n\nWe didn't have a great deal of time, being a 'business lunch' where discussing business was actually on the agenda (for a change), so we decided to try the 2 course menu offer for \u00a310 which, I must say, did have a great selection of both entre/starter and mains from which to choose.\n\nService from the staff was excellent and the meals, which were served in a timely 'I don't have a great deal of time business lunch fashion, were above average to the taste and visually pleasing.\n\nAs it was lunch and mid week, the atmosphere was lacking, however I have no doubt that come Friday or Saturday night, pre or post theatre (its located right behind Usher Hall), the place would come to life.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit."
1,"Good place to see a show, concessions are way over priced."
3,"I've been lunching here since it was Thai Elephant (same family) and not much has changed. The service is great. Cain's normally there to serve us but everyone's awesome. Plus, one of the owners is usually there to make sure everything's copacetic. \n\nWhat I really like ... the Tofu Pad Thai, medium spicy. I'm not sure exactly what they do to the tofu but it's somewhere between soft and pressed and has an absolutely perfect brown sugary (with something else) flavor seared into it. Caveat: The Pad Thai here is sweet ... sweeter than most I've had, but I think it just works awesomely with the other flavors; definitely my favorite Pad Thai in PHX. \n\nIf I'm on a lower carb lower cal day, it's Tofu Panang, pork chop (awesome chili sauce), or Spicy Eggplant. \n\nI like everything medium and could handle hot if I had to -- I don't know why I'd have too, I tried it before and it was fine, medium is just more enjoyable to me. But I dare you to order Thai Hot! better yet, trick your friend with the severe case of little man syndrome into ordering Thai Hot and watch him sweat, possibly bleed*, and then let him try to convince you it wasn't all that hot while you knowingly smile and nod.\n\n* I was at 5 R Cha with my daughters when this guy at the table next to us ordered double Thai hot obviously to impress his girlfriend. Cain appropriately warned him of the intense hotness of Thai Hot and of double's exponentially hotter hotness and the poor patron simply brushed aside these dutiful warnings. About three quarters of the way though the meal, he (beet red and sweaty he) was informed by aforementioned girlfriend that his nose was bleeding ... as if that wasn't going to get our attention. I then made and to this day stand by the logical leap: Double Thai Hot at 5 R Cha can make you bleed."
3,"I wish I could say the first time I hit up the Beat was for strictly personal reasons. However, it was for a meeting. A fun meeting though. Upon my arrival downtown, I was pleasantly surprised how close the El Cortez parking was to the Beat. Now, I've been by the Emergency Arts Center before, and to the El Cortez, but never made the connection about their proximity to each other. Others at the meeting made the mistake of parking at the meters (meeting was at 4pm on a Friday, so meters were in effect) and paying, while the El Cortez is free99. \n\nNow, I can get behind a local, artsy, coffee shop (especially one that serves beer after 7pm). I can also get behind a coffee shop that sells locally roasted coffee from Boulder City. However, I can really get behind a place that has free wifi, is great for meetings, and has a friendly staff. Fortunately, the Beat is that kind of place. \n\nFor the first two hours I was there, I didn't have any coffee. Once the meeting was over, I grabbed a cup of joe (nothing fancy, just black) and proceeded to be shown the EAC by a couple friends who frequent this joint. I'd go into that, but I am not reviewing the rest of the EAC...\n\nWhat stops this place from being a 5 star is that I simply wasn't impressed with the coffee. It was good, better than say Starbucks, but didn't knock my socks off. Now, I will definitely give this another shot, and try something with espresso as that will really determine the quality of the coffee and the baristas."
4,"We recently had our engagement pictures taken by Gary at four white walls photography... I love their work from what I've seen before at events, but I wasn't sure what to expect from an actual 'photo shoot.'\n\nWe were extremely impressed with how professional Gary and Sheila were during the session.  We met at the LOVE statue in the Scottsdale Center for Performing Arts area and took pictures all around there...\n\nDespite the fact that Jared thought I was wearing too much makeup, and me not hearing the end of it for keeping it on, we had so much fun doing the shoot.  Sheila and Gary made us feel really comfortable along the way.\n\nSo as anyone would be, I was anxious to see how the pictures came out.  Gary sent a few to me via email within 48 hours, and an entire CD of the shoot arrived in my mailbox within 5 days.  If you're anxious to see a few of the pics, you're in luck... I've posted them to my profile pics.\n\nHere are the links to a few of my faves: \nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/photo/d_i7S4uyxLB6YJ09nghmzw/l\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/photo/kTRHpCHtny08KgJ0qtKTAA/l\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/photo/3jhIDaEUa_tJMlKVQV21DQ/l\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/photo/70TjzrRHzMnXPul4tUmhEQ/l\n\nPricing was reasonable, especially to what I've seen other photographers in the Valley quoting for engagement sessions.  If you need professional pics taken, give these guys a call!"
3,Nothing super special about this place.  Good coffee and decent sandwiches (especially after a long night of drinking. \n\nIt's gets 4 stars for two reasons:\n\n1. Free WiFI\n2. Open 24/7.
2,"Had lunch here the other day...  I'm still skeptical about a place like this doing asian food as I spied a  Hibachi Steak and Chicken option on the menu, but I decided to go with the Santa Fe Salad which was gi-normous, filling, and very tasty.  \n\nThe hostess and waiter were pretty friendly as they didn't seem all that busy for lunch.  It did feel like it took a while for the food to come out, but it all worked out in the end:  they got their money and I got a decent meal."
3,"Went to Pizza People Pub the other night for dinner, hoping to get some more of the awesome pizza I'd had from their truck back in May.\n\nThe pizza was wonderful as I remembered, and I also tried the Spud Fingers app (good seasoning, though the potatoes could stand to be cooked longer), and the Peach Cobbler for dessert. Get the peach cobbler! It's so good, served warm with a crunchy-topped biscuit topping and vanilla ice cream.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try some other items on their menu, as well as more of that tasty pizza! You can read more about my dinner there on my blog, ovenandapron.com."
4,"Unquestionably, from the first time we stopped at this place on our way to the movies, we have become regular patrons. The food quality is very good  a la par with their prices. The atmosphere is very nice and casual, plus the service staff is friendly and helpful. In addition, they deliver which we have taken under consideration when we decide to stay home, $12.00 minimum order for delivery.  Needless to say, the Asian cuisine is diverse and flavorful."
3,so i had a bday giftcard but it was for another noodle place she signed me up and gave me a free dessert anyway (which was the peanut butter pie GREAT) when i sat down to dine in i made my drink and went to table (i was in front) but soon as i grabed  it it wasted everywhere the lady from back came over in .2 seconds and cleaned it up. gave me a cup and silverware but wet sign out and everything she was on it
4,"Our front yard was a complete disaster and faces a busy street. After researching and getting a few quotes we decided to give AMS our business and so glad we did. Ryan came out, listen to our wants and needs, and then gave us some great ideas. The Emerald Palo Verde and different selections of cactus are fantastic. Our new watering system works great. (though I will have to have an electrician move the electrical run for the timer - but that's ok - I need other electrical work done as well.) \n\nI will be contacting AMS to setup routine maintenance service."
3,"I don't always feel like I get enough culture in my daily life so I took this last Saturday night to do something I have never done before, see a musical.  Sure, I go to a lot of concerts but they are usually of the heavy metal variety.  It is a different crowd than the kind you find at the Smith Center.  People were well dressed and well behaved.  There was no roudy element.  The Smith Center provided me with a relaxed atmosphere to see a good show.  I was impressed with the entire experience.  The Smith Center is an incredible facility.  From the park across the stree with statues and other sculptures to the Italian marble inside.  From the lime stone exterior to the art deco stainless steel.  This is a magnificant building.  I was seated in the upper level of the balcony section.  Before the show started I slowly made my way to the upper lobby observing the art and decor.  When I arrived at the fifth floor I sat for a while reading through the program for the evening.  A bit later I ordered a coke for $3 (not bad by the way).  There is an outdoor balcony up there with views of Down Town Las Vegas and of the mountains to the North.  It was pleasent place to wait for seating to begin.  I was shocked at how high I was sitting when I first entered the theatre.  The back row of the balcony seemed to be 80-100 feet above the floor below.  It was a hike to get up there.  One I was not really prepared for.  Once I was seated though, I was rewarded with a great view of a fantastic show.  I enjoyed my visit to the Smith Center and I am already looking forward to going back for other shows.  There are a few on my radar that I may consider.  I think I want to sit lower next time though.  The balcony is fine but I don't want the hike again.  Besides, how am I to know the best seat in the house without trying other seats first?"
3,"IMPRESSED! Cozy & fun atmosphere makes you feel right welcome and part of Montreal, not like a tourist.\n\nTheir in house brews were good, plenty to choose from and I must say for what seemed to look like a simple bar food menu turned out to be very impressive on all accounts. From Fries, Burgers & Onion Rings to Quesadillas and tacos to Edemame and Samosas. Everything was tasty, fresh and quick!\n\nI'll be back!"
3,I've been here a few times and It's hit or miss.  The sushi is pretty decent and Fresh. They are weird and pricey when it comes to special requests.  The boba tea is great. The second time I had it it want blended well but the taro and Bob's flavor made up for it. I also orders a tofu dish. It was way too oily.  Sometimes the service is Really Sweet sometimes bitter
1,"I never write a review until I leave but this place has me a bit upset. When I walk in the guy say you should sit at the bar but oh you can sit anywhere but the bar is best. Ok I take it I need to sit at the bar. So I order food. Just 10 wings. They bring me only 9. Yep I'm at bit pissed off. I pay for 10 I'd like to have 10. If I ever return to Pittsburg I don't think I'd come back. Service is like 90 percent of the dining experience. When I told my bartender she just blew it off. I guess because they are by the baseball field they can do whatever! I'm so not happy! I also order tequilla Dobel $15 when I have gotten it for $4. Stick to beer. $3.75-7.00\n\nFor those who care or dare to try-maybe you'll have a better experience than me-the wings are good, all 9 if them."
0,"One word comes to mind - Pretentious.  If you want to know what going to Le Local feels like, pull out a few $20 bills, spread some butter on it and eat it.  Wash it down with some water and pretend you just drank a cocktail.\n\nIt amazes me that this place has over 3 stars, especially after eating at various local restaurants in the area.  After a week of dining in and around Montreal (Vieux Montreal mostly) I can safely say this place is one of the most expensive places I visited and had the worst food overall.\n\nHow do you screw up Poutine??  For those that don't know Poutine, it's a local favorite in Montreal, combining french fries with cheese curds, topped with delicious gravy.  And somehow Le Local found a way to screw up this simple recipe.\n\nMy wife and I bought two drinks (a Mojito and a Martini) and they were both diluted to the point where it was hard to distinguish it from plain water. Oh, and they were $10+ each.  Needless to say, we didn't order another.\n\nNext up - the bread.  I rarely ever comment on bread, but it was so terrible I feel the need to warn others.  For a restaurant that charges as much as it does, having stale bread that tastes like you're chewing on someone else's gum is just unacceptable.  How about serving some freshly baked bread, preferably something with flavor?\n\nThe only saving grace was the Veal Burger, which was pretty damn good.  Not good enough to warrant the price, but it was good.  I don't even remember what my wife ordered - it was some odd tasting fish that she didn't eat.\n\nOverall this was a giant skid mark in an otherwise splendid trip to Montreal.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  Anywhere else.  It's hard to find something that's worse."
3,"I took one of my friends to this restaurant when she visited from out of town.  As she describes her sense of fashion/home decor as \""ghetto nouveau-french,\""  I decided to treat her to a French-style dinner.\n\nFrom the outside, Coup des Tartes definitely fits the \""ghetto\"" theme.  Situated in an unassuming restaurant in a neighborhood that I wouldn't walk through at night, it doesn't look like much from the outside.\n\nHowever, when you step inside, you feel like you've stepped into one of those tiny European cafes that are squeezed into a space that shouldn't be legal.  If you are claustrophobic, or if you don't want to hear the strangers at the next table chewing, then this is not the restaurant for you.\n\nBUT~if you want delicious food in a cozy and warm atmosphere where you can hear the stranger next to you chew away, then this is definitely the restaurant for you!\n\nTo be honest, I visited this restaurant a couple of years ago, so I couldn't tell you 100% what I had to eat.  What i CAN say is that the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was quite romantic.  Of course, it was more or less wasted on us at the time since it was two girls, but it was quite nice for a girly night out as well!\n\nThey recommended that you make a reservation on the weekend, which I would also second, since seating is limited.  This is not a restaurant where you are in and out within an hour.  \n\nPick up your own bottle(s) of wine (so you know what you're drinking, and don't have to think of overpriced bottles), slow down, and take your time."
3,"After multiple delays in Pinkberry getting to the strip (remember when they were supposed to open at the Forum Shops in 2007?), I finally got to check out what all the commotion was about.  I had only heard about it from others.\n\nThere are some big differences between Pinkberry and their frozen yogurt competitors:\n\n- They are really pushing the health factor and with the addition of their Greek yogurt line, it makes it seem OK to get a large portion even if you just stuffed your face at a buffet beforehand.  \n\n- Their original flavor was a lot less tart than Yogurtland or Red Mango and that was a big plus for me.  It was smooooooth.  \n\n- I also liked some of their creative seasonal flavors like key lime and lychee.  I heard they offer other choices like watermelon and pumpkin at different times of the year.  The flavor department of Pinkberry sounds like a fun place to work.\n\n- I dislike that the staff has to put the toppings on and puts a number limit based on the size you order.  They charge more than others so we should have it the way we want it.    \n\nConsider me a fan overall though.  I can't imagine I would drive to the strip just for this (especially since I would have to park at Aria and then walk over) but I would definitely be down when I am in the vicinity."
0,"F#%$ this noise. \n\nI take clean over fancy anytime. \n\n\nThe beds were NASTY-no mattress cover- did not use fitted sheets. Had a naked down comforter (no duvet) with stains. \n\nThis one was the icing-After a hot clean shower I go to put on the robe they provide. As I start getting ready I notice something in my pocket--------I find disgusting DIRTY g-string panty in my robe pocket. \n\nI don't think I'll be staying here. \n\nThe hotel is  beautiful, hip, trendy, and yes a great day club and night club but when I'm paying $$$$  to stay here-please keep up the quality. Starting with the rooms first and then move on to the disgusting carpeting around the halls."
2,"While not the fanciest hoteln on the strip, the MC works hard to provide amenities and location that keep your costs down while in vegas.  The pool offers more options than caesers, venetian or palazzo and you can get a chaise lounge.  Not being able to move the chairs to sun direction is a problem.\n\nFood court is great, access to food and sundries at cvs, walgreens and abc stores across the street is great. Train is fantastic way to get all the way down to the bellagio free..\n\nNice little sports book at no fee (hear that Venetian)..\n\nHip, music on the sidewalk at night.\n\nOne complaint, wireless access in the rooms is woefully behind the times. 4g barely works, most of the your are in E mode. Lets get modern MC, invest in wireless access points for our mobile devices in the rooms.."
0,"This place is a joke. Whatever you do--don't pay extra for feta cheese cuz you won't get it lol! 2nd time this has happened. 1st time, okay I understand but 2nd time - now your just making free $$ .\n\nAsked for my gyro with feta cheese, tomatoes & lettuce. Lettuce went missing too! My asst. Ordered a chicken pita & there was 4 very small pieces dried up pieces of chicken.\n\nI called to today to let them know they needed to pick up the pace & not rip people off with feta cheese, & lack of lettuce and lack of chicken of my assts lunch. But the owner answered and told me to speak with the person who made the lunches!! Are you kidding me ? What owner puts their cook on the phone ? A lazy one!! Yes, the cook messed up but to put the cook on the phone to handle the situation ?! The cook even said it was unprofessional of the owner to put him on the phone. \n\nSo, you will not get feta, lettuce, decent chicken or a answer from management/owner.. But the cook is forced to talk with angry customers! Lol! What a joke!"
3,"The Main Ingredient has quickly become one of our favorite chill-out spots. friendly people, good food, huge portions, good beers.\n\nsome highlights:\n\nwe usually sit at the bar. I'll order beers(drafts are half off during Happy Hour 3-6pm), and he'll order a Coke(Mexican--bottled). the house olives are fantastic(plenty of fresh garlic, fresh herbs, and citrus zest), as well as the chips and salsa(fairly average chips, but the salsa is incredible). \n\nI've gotten the Red Goat salad twice(greens, TONS of strawberries and pistachios, rich balsamic dressing and an abundance of goat cheese--though, the second time around, I ordered it with gorgonzola dulce). \n\nHubby has had the Coney(HUGE hot dog on a fantastic bun...delicious all around), and the Cash Money...holy HELL. this sandwich is...SO rich. full of cashew butter(house made), red pepper jelly(made with Cabernet), and banana...it's off the hook, trust me.\n\nin the daytime, it's a fun spot to chill. at night, it's a great blend of romantic(very dim, with candles on every table) and hip. love this place."
1,"OHH mad onion! The laughs that this restaurant has brought in to my life.\n\nOn a Vegas trip my friends and I decided to stay at the Hooters Hotel for a cheap place close to the strip.  Needless to say, we spent many a night stumbling back to our hotel in search of buttery 25 CENT wings.\n\nIn all honesty, they are nothing special and the service is less than mediocre...\nI would normally give it 1 star...but the memories that my friends and I have in this place still keep us laughing today!"
2,"Went to a holiday pizza party here last night.  We had about 50 people and lots and lots of food.  They served 6 different pizzas, 4 orders each, for a total of 24 large pizzas.  They also served 3 different salads, in large serving bowls -- I think they filled the bowls again.  My purpose is telling you this is because I felt the servings that were ordered and delivered were very generous and filling -- nobody went home hungry last night.  HOWEVER -- I felt the food was rather bland.....not bad, not terrible, just bland.  The pizzas did not have enough seasonings and even salt on them.  Normally the cheese is salty too, but not last night.  And the salad dressings, all three of them, were rather bland.....to me, there was enough olive oil in them, but not enough seasoning and vinegar.  All-in-all, I thought it was a nice party with lots of food, but for the price, I don't think I would go back again."
0,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I came into c&r tire on May 24, 2014 and replaced all 4 tires. I was never offered a warranty and the tire was damaged within 7 days and under 400 miles. The owner, Ralph, was extremely rude to me and actually expected me to pay for a new tire!! He claims I declined the road hazard warranty when it was never offered. I have been a discount tire customer for years and thought it was strange no warranty was offered at c&r. I know that they have an all new staff as the 79.91 cash(of the 429.91) I paid was never received(stolen by employee) and I was given a call within a few days asking me to come pay this amount again. Employees are thieves and apparently it is a learned trait from their owner. I am a business owner and I stand behind my product for at least 2 weeks!! I will never do business with c&r tire again and bad word of mouth passes so much faster than good word of mouth."
2,"This restaurant/bar near the University of Edinburgh campus of George Square appears much more serious and grown up than the other cafes in the area, who cater mostly to students on a lunch break.\n\nSo it makes sense I was only there once with my parents, during Fresher's Week and haven't really thought to head back since. There's nothing THAT special about it, yet there's quite little to complain about. Everything was okay when I had drinks there, and one thing it does have going for it is the large outdoor seating area. It may seem useless for most of the year, but while it's warm enough it's quite nice to sit out there and take in the sights, such as... Appleton Tower? Granted not the best of locations, but it'll do I suppose.\n\nThey serve food as well, but I never planned to eat there so can't really say what's on the menu."
0,"Came for a weekend with a large group of co-workers and it started off horrible from the minute we checked in! I don't even know where to begin. Our boss was going to pay not only for the rooms but the deposit you make in case anything else gets charged or things get ruined. They billed me anyways! Our rooms were not ready and they took our cell numbers and said they would call when ready, never did! Asked if we wanted coffee in our room. Never brought it! We asked them to bring sheets etc. for the fold out bed/couch and to please get it ready. Never did! At the pool we sat down and it took 45min to get a drink and just as long to get the bill! The only time we had some good service was at the little bar downstairs. Eric was great! This did not make up for anything though! DO NOT EVER GO THERE OR YOU WILL BE SORRY! I have stayed at many other las Vegas hotels and had great service! Beware!"
2,"Nove is a place I really wanted to like. The service was excellent and attentive.  The N9ne group is a great group. The food, especially for the price was seriously lacking.  2 stars are for the great service and views.  I would only give the food 1 star. The other 3 people in my group agree.  The food is far over price for the quality. Pane Vino is far better and in the same price range.  In my opinion you will be much happier  going to Nora's or Lucio and wont pay nearly as much.  I was shocked that the N9ne group had such lacking food with N9ne steakhouse is so much better. Albeit different but much better quality.   You let me down Nove."
3,"Very charming.  We booked the \u00a312 for two courses \""table d'hote\"" menu on 5pm.co.uk which was a pretty good deal.  I noted on the reservation that I was eight months pregnant and would like a comfortable table, and they quite kindly accommodated by putting us at a four-top table where I could sit on a bench with a high, straight back.  Heaven.  I really appreciated this, and the atmosphere of the place in general didn't disappoint.  The cheeky little devil of their logo is a perfect window into the vibe of the place--1920s French bistro decor.  A bit of art, a bit of artlessness.  \n\nService was a bit...well.  I did appreciate the table but the servers were either scary or flaky.  But maybe that's just Scottish service in general.  We definitely did not feel rushed and were there for over 90 minutes enjoying an app, an entree, and a dessert.\n\nWe split the grilled goat's cheese app, which had a generous portion of cheese but could have used a bit more greens.  Still, the flavors were in a lovely complement to one another and we licked the plate clean.  We both paid the extra \u00a35 for the Aberdeen Angus steak, and I would discourage you from doing the same.  The steak was pretty good and cooked properly to order, but the sauces accompanying it were extremely overpowering.  No nuance, just a screaming pile of GARLIC or BERRIES (maybe the other sauces were a bit more elegant, but these two were not).  Dessert though brought things back around with the gorgeous chocolate terrine.  \n\nThe Table d'Hote menu is limited but if booked on 5pm is a great deal.  It's a nice leisurely meal where the food is mostly pretty great and served in a charming little slice of France."
2,"I'm a dim sum lover. Boston, Chicago, Denver, Columbus, OKC.  All good.\nThis place is good enough in a craving pinch when you live in Phoenix and don't feel like driving to Chandler.  It's 7 min from my house so I will go back.  \n\nDim sum staples all there... Shu Mei, BBQ Pork Bao, Sticky Rice, Chinese Broccoli was ok, nothing special.  It just doesn't seem made fresh.  I don't know if it was pre made a few days before or just bought from a supplier in mass. Just didn't taste \""prepared that morning\"" fresh.\n\nAlso, was hoping for more pan fried options.\n\nThe place was full on a Sunday so that's good."
0,"Went in on a sunday afternoon. Place was dead. Wasn't greeted, sat at a table and was not helped. Waited 10 minutes, still no service. Walked out and still heard nothing from staff. \n\nIf time and service are important to you stay away from Hob Nob."

0,"Don't fall for one of the biggest scams around!!!\n\n***We didn't stay here, the review is only for the timeshare presentation.***\n\nThe presentation was basically whole bunch of lies & a big scam (you salespeople can deny, but the fact is the fact). Our sales lady (I think her name's June) was very unprofessional, rude, and the biggest lier.\n\nThe property was FAR from the strip. The presentation took us 4 hours! The free lunch was basically ham sandwiches - which didn't look fresh. \n\nAnyway, we were there for the free tickets & gaming chips. Our sales lady got upset when we told her that we knew about timeshare and were not interested. She said we were trying to be smart and didn't have money, and she was wasting her time...Even though we tried to be polite, she was rude and unprofessional the whole time because we didn't fall for her scam. Some of her lies & sales pitches were ridiculous and made me wanna laugh.\n\nThe two bedrooms that she showed us looked nice when you first walk in. But when you pay attention to the details of the rooms, you can tell they used very cheap material. To put my money into this piece of crap..Nooooo way!\n\nAt the end of the presentation, we even said thank you to our saleslady, she just walked away and rolled her eyes. Do you really need to be THAT unprofessional? At this point I just wanted to laugh at her again...\n\nI saw some people did purchase the timeshare from them. I feel bad for the people who come to Vegas to enjoy their vacation but end up fall for the timeshare scam. Grandview salespeople, you guys are no better than those Nigerian scammers. Go find a better job and have some basic moral."
1,"First off, a heads up. Though the business is listed here as Salsa's, it's now actually Cabo's. \n\nI stopped here spur of the moment for takeout lunch and ended up ordering the Chicken Taco Salad. It wasn't exactly what I was used to--the black beans and chicken were both hot. I prefer my taco salad cold because lettuce with really warm food is a little gross, so I ended up sticking it in the fridge to cool down before eating more. \n\nI'll give them credit for the serving size (and the chips made for a nice snack later on). However, I wasn't overly impressed with the service. I was charged for the dinnertime salad rather than the lunch one (keep in mind I came in at 1PM), but the guy at the counter wouldn't admit to it. What happened to the mantra, \""The customer is always right?\"" I'm no Albert Einstein, but just eyeballing the receipt (and with the help of my handy calculator), it wasn't hard to figure out that I was.\n\nOk, ok...time to cool off! All in all, I was only charged $1.00 extra, but it was a complete turnoff that the Cabo employee wasn't being honest and tried to make up a mysterious extra charge."
3,"My daughter requested that we have a few of her teenage friends come along with us to try Burgr for her birthday. I was pleasantly surprised! \n\nIf you live here in Vegas, the strip tends to be more a nuisance than a novelty. But not for the sake of my daughter's birthday request, we just wouldn't have bothered. With the combination of being located inside a strip casino and being a Gordon Ramsay property, I expected everything to be ridiculously overpriced, but considering the factors involved, it was very reasonably priced. \n\nThe menu is ala carte, with the burgers ranging from $12-$16. The fries cost between $8-$11, and easily feed two. Appetizers cost about the same as the entrees, and the homemade shakes ($9) are just divine!\n\nEverything ordered all around was absolutely delicious! We were also pleased with the service. I have but one complaint about the entire experience. They should never have left the restaurant open to the casino. It is so terribly loud in there. When you can hear the nickel-mongers cheering their $12 jackpot over the person seated next to you, it's time to consider building some sort of partition.\n\nOtherwise, we had a lovely experience at Burgr!"
1,"Came a friday night at around midnight for some drinks with friends. REALLY LOUD techno music with a sad story from Fox News playing on all the TV screens. I just can't figure out this bar out. From the looks of this scarce bar, neither can anyone else. Shame because it looks like a great sports bar during the day. They just need to figure out their night scene."
0,"Ridiculous. I have had better fresher sushi from a supermarket. The place is overpriced and completely poor quality. Pretty sure they gave us canned tuna and canned crab soaked in mayo. The service is a joke. It took forever to place an order, the woman next to us had to flag down a waitress to even get a drink order and she was there longer than us. The servers checked on us once after we received our food. We literally waited more than  20 minutes to get the check and another ten to get my card back. \n\nThe rolls are so oversize and we did not even get a plate to put our rolls down. I am pretty sure most of these reviews are fake or these people have never had semi-decent sushi. The rolls were just a huge mess and fell apart if you tried to move them. Each bite of sushi here was equivalent of three bites of normal sushi. I was really excited because this place had such amazing reviews. I just wasted 40+ dollars on a terrible experience. I should have just gone to a supermarket or gas station, because at least they are honest about ripping me off."
2,"Location: You would think 215 & flamingo would be a great location for the gym well its not. Although this place is right off the 215 once you exist you have to turn or U-turn on flamingo to get to LVAC. Also there's one main entrance into the plaza and its always traffic going in around 5:30 when I go. I know its the busy hours but common. \n\nAmenities: The towels there are definitely the cleanest and softest, I never use it but there's lotion in the women's locker room. The machines, I'm not a fan of most of the machines here. I know they're probably the newest and updated machines but why fix something that was already working. I like the machines at the LVAC rainbow location. The parking lot isn't as big as their other locations and parking is always horrible. \n.\nSetup: The bad, the way this gym is setup is so weird. They have weights on the first floor and the second floor. Constantly when I'm down stairs I'll hear some one up stairs dropping heavy weights and I get scared. Scared because I think if this constantly happens when will the second floor give out. The women's gym is pretty small but not as small as the rainbow location. The biggest women's section I've been to is the gym on Sahara and Maryland. \n\nCustomer Service: The customer service here is by far the best out of all the LVAC locations. The front desk workers are super nice, sometimes even funny. Even the janitors are nice. Especially in the locker rooms when ever the floors wet from somebody coming out of the pool. Some how they're always there in a jiffy to clean it up. I've never seen a wet puddle in that spotless locker room."
3,Love their watches and the guy who was there when I went was way too hot to be working retail!  :)
0,Terrible experience. Always trying to up-sell. Took my wife's SUV thru yesterday.  Paid for the top of the line wash. Interior wasn't complete. When I pointed out the dirt the attendant handed ME a rag. Thanks for nothing!  My last visit to this place.
2,"Went on a Monday - an app, two burgers, o-rings and 4 drinks - $72  - We had the Cali burger and turkey burger both good.  The house made o-rings were over battered and too greasy for my taste.  With two of the drinks being on \""Happy Hour\"" (note: only seated at the bar or outside) seems pretty expensive for a burger joint.\n\nHad 3 servers standing around but only the bartender did anything - had to flag her down a time or two.  Still seems like they are sorting out things, hopefully pricing is one of them."
2,"I used to come here when it was a Vietnamese restaurant, so when I drove by and saw that the spot was something else I wanted to give it a try.  The new owners renovated it to a Thai restaurant.  I was pretty impressed from what it used to look inside to what it is now.  I'll have to admit the layout gave it a better feng shui feel to the place.  It looked much more brighter and cleaner inside.  Their dishes and decor was more updated.  \n\nI tried a few of their appetizers/desserts were pretty delicious .. The main entrees tasted decent (I mean there is no comparison to home made Thai food right ?! ). \n\nThe time that I went they were just opening up, so I feel like I couldn't really give them a a fair rating ... I'll give them a few months to work out the kinks of running a new restaurant."
2,"IKEA is alright but not all it's cracked up to be.  While I love the ideas for space saving, most of the furniture isn't Swedish.  Much of it is actually the same cheap \""Made in China\"" stuff that Walmart sells.  Most of it did not look very durable.  People rave about the restaurant in there, but iceberg salad and spinach crepes that have been sitting in a warmer for who knows how long aren't even as good as hopsital food is these days.  The whole way to shop is a pain too.  See what you want and write it down while wandering this monstrosity?  If they can be so efficient with designs of rooms, why can't they make they building more efficient?  It really is ironic when you think about it.  I'd go to Ikea again, but I'm not in a rush to do so."
2,"After walking the length of the Ste Anne boardwalk on a recent sunny day, we chose Marco's for lunch based on the nice patio (with about a third of the tables full - busy compared to other restaurants on the boardwalk) and the variety of sauces for mussels. \n\nOff to a bad start right off the bat. It took some time for the waitress to come by with menus - this inattentiveness turned into a theme for our meal. To be fair, there was only one other waitress manning the tables when we first got there. But by halfway through our lunch, there were only two other occupied tables - no excuse for paying so little attention to us then. We weren't being particularly demanding - we just wanted our order to be taken soon after we had closed our menus (I don't think a 10 minute wait is acceptable), and for her to notice when we had finished a beer and offer another one. \n\nFood wasn't bad at all - decent portion sizes - but it would help if the right thing was brought out (twice the wrong item was brought out, both times after having had a discussion with the waitress about the items in question so I'd think she would have remembered). The all dressed pizza had a crust that was doughy and on the thick side, not my preference but it was decently tasty otherwise. The spicy sausage pasta was ok- it was quite a large dish, but something that you could easily make at home. The ravioli with ros\u00e9 sauce was pretty decent. My mussels with Pernod sauce was good (though there were lots of mussels with the beards still on them) - it was a creamy sauce and the Pernod dissipated nicely into it. Only wish it came with some bread to sop up the sauce! \n\nOverall, the poor service outweighed the food and ambiance - perhaps it would be different on another day, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give it another chance."
4,"Really enjoyed the food here!  I was contemplating whether to give it 4 stars but then I thought what could have been better and couldn't really think of anything.  The service was prompt and friendly - they were attentive without being annoying.  \n\nI got what I usually get at Thai places - Spicy Basil Noodles and they were probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  I got a level 8 spicy and most of the time at other Thai establishments I'm disappointed in the lack of spiciness even when I get a level 8, but I can honestly say it was satisfactory level 8 spice worthy - which I truly appreciated.  \n\nIt was jumping for dinner and it's BYOB so stop by the wine and spirits store beforehand!"
0,"We stopped by one night for dinner because it looked nice. We got the booth by the door. Everything was great until the food came out. The food itself was fine, nothing to write home about but what happened during our meal is unforgivable. Cockroaches came out every few minutes. They'd come out, we'd try to kill them with a napkin and miss. They'd go back and come back out after a few minutes. We had to squeeze into one side of the booth to keep an eye out for them. We told the waitress, who saw one still browsing around and she got the manager, who then tried to kill it using a napkin and a cell phone flash light. He missed and walked away without saying anything. No apology or anything! I was so disgusted that I didn't finish eating. We left and won't be going back."
0,It's 4:50 and these guys are closed on a Tuesday. The sign says Monday they are closed. This is the second time I have came by and they where closed and they say they are open from 12pm-7pm not even long hours and no body is Operating the business. I am giving them a 1 star because this is the second time being here and no answer. I bought a top for my pen from these guys before when they where open and It was decent. I ended up getting a different one that has lasted a lot longer and better for my use. Bummer these guys are not operating this business right.
1,"We used to frequent the Verde Grill 3 times a week.  We were driven out of the bar area by a VERY loud regular customer who sounds like Rhoda's mother.  The pitch of her voice is at a level that cannot be tuned out!  That being said we decided to leave the sports bar area and move our visits into the dining room area.  Again we used to visit 3 times a week.  Our favorites were the salmon, the chicken with asparagus and rice, the steak salad.  We used to love the crabcakes, the sliders, both beef and pork, the pork tenderloin and wings, and the yummy wedge salad..  We loved the friendliness of some of the servers and appreciated that it was usually pretty busy, but fun.  The food began to be lacking and inconsistent and we continued to come and try to give it another shot.  Towards the end of our patronage they began dropping down the big movie type screen (eliminating two tables and booth settings) and from our observations the only people watching those games were the servers.  It changed from a dining room atmosphere into feeling like you were in someone's basement to watch the big game.  We felt that if we were paying \""restaurant\"" prices that we would do better to go to a different restaurant than to be unhappy at a place where the food was no longer dependable.  We have nothing against a sports bar if that is what we choose, but if we choose a restaurant we don't want a 60-72 inch screen hanging in the center of the window wall.  Cloth napkins, gorgeous view from all sides (except with the screen down) works when combined with amazing or even good consistently flavored and prepared food.  When the staff and management stop to care and it begins to show in both atmosphere and food, it was time for us to go.\nIt is really too bad to depend on the golfers for post course drinks and burgers and to let the amazing building and location languish when there is such a captive audience living right outside your doors in the heavily populated neighborhood with expendable cash in their pockets waiting to spend it locally!  Such a shame."
1,"This restaurant is impossible to find...hidden on the lower level of the Optima Camelview condo complex, and parking is even worse. You have to enter the parking complex under the Optima and, good luck finding a spot in visitor parking. Signage is not strong here. If, or, when you find this restaurant they offer both indoor, or, outside dining. The outside is a charming and inviting setting, however, bring a flashlight to read the menu. It is extremely dark with only a small candle to read by. The menu is large, perhaps too large. The are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They seem to be trying to do too much, with few customers. They offer a full bar. The mac and cheese is bland, it seemed liked Cheese Wiz on shell macaroni. The other sandwiches were ok, nothing exciting or different. The menu prices are on the high side. This restaurant replaced another deli that folded. Their appeal is definitely to the residents of the Condos here. It would NEVER be a destination restaurant...it is too difficult to find for mediocre food. We tried this restaurant because it is a sister restaurant of one of our favorites in Phoenix, \""Fez\"". We wish them luck, I hated to see restaurant fold, but, this location has a difficult obstacle to over come with it's location."
2,The portabello burger is soooo nasty! Yuck! \nThe only things we get are the thousand bean pitta which is really good and the pesto pizza yummy as well. \nThey have fast service.
4,"Service was quick, friendly and easy!  Great location if you live in the Central Phoenix area.  Fair and honest prices."
0,Wow.  Must've been an off day but I arrived when there were lines at every eatery at CLT Airport.  My food was scorched and had a flavor of being burnt.  Never coming here again. Big disappointment.
0,"Horrible!!!! We booked through Expedia and when I checked in they didn't have my reservations so they charged my card twice and said one would drop off. While walking to our room there was a girl unconscious and cops were trying to wake her, the hotel smelled like weed, and people were throwing their own parties in the parking lot... One word GHETTO!!!"
4,"LOVE this place.  everything we've ordered has been amazing.  we would go here every week if we lived close!  the new location is a lot bigger. there is also a large patio sitting area with some lounge couches too.  the last time we went we received EXCEPTIONAL service.  can't wait to go back, we want to try everything on the menu it is so good :) i honestly think it is my favorite restaurant!"
0,"The Food Truck Festival was awful I wish got my time and money back.  I should up around 6:00 pm and the parking lot was packed. I broke my leg 8 weeks ago and it was hard for me to maneuver through all the rock and plug in wires. In two hours I was only able to three trucks, beetit, torched goddess and a barbecue truck. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was amazing, but I would rather deal with the crazy people scavenging for samples at Costco. We left earlier than we expected since most of the lines were fifty deep and headed to Postinos and had an amazing dinner. I rather go check out the good trucks in a different setting. Good Concept though."
0,"I came to test-drive a car and all of the questions I asked the salesman read the answers directly off the sticker. Since I am a literate person, that wasn't necessary nor was it relevant as the questions I had about the vehicle didn't have answers that could have been found on the sticker. Yeah, I do my own research before I waltz into these places and when I ask questions I expect my \""expert\"" sales guy to answer them as he is supposed to know what he's selling, right?\nI had to leave. \nThe next day, Salesguy Einstein called me. And then a few days later. And again, a few days after that. I'll give him that for at least being persistent. But he thought the price was the problem - not the car itself, which I decided I didn't like anymore after I drove it, and he was leaving me these ridiculous messages about selling me a \""used Mercedes.\"" It was all really annoying and embarrassing to listen to."
1,"My girlfriends and I are HUGE foodies and huge Tom Colicchio fans.   My issue was that the three of us came to restaurant ready to spend money on a fantastic meal and the entire meal felt rushed.  Our server made it clear that the kitchen was super \""slammed' and made us feel as though we didn't have the luxury of time to enjoy the various courses of our meal.    He almost audibly sighed when we decided to order extra oysters and one of the servers had a conniption fit in front of us when he came to the table and saw that we were still eating our apps.  To top it all off - we decided that we would do a \""taste test\"" between the Kobe Rib Eye and the \""regular\"" filet.  It was very disappointing to say that while both steaks were good there was no wow factor for either.   Then we discover that our original server left without introducing the new server.  It was very obvious that the staff were ready for us to leave and this was disappointing since we spent quite a bit of money there and weren't really made to feel welcome.   We left not talking about the great food - but about the disappointment we felt."
0,"I was completely disappointed in the quality of the food.  I work downtown and my office mates and I order from Eat quite regularly, but today we were shocked to have received some of the worst food we've ever eaten from Eat.  We ordered both of the chicken sandwiches that are on the limited menu only to discover they were obviously made from frozen chicken breasts that were rubbery and tasted like plastic.  The bread was soggy which, when combined with the disgusting chicken made our sandwiches inedible.  My co worker and I ended up throwing both of our lunches away.  We were also told they no longer are making beignets, which we came to really enjoy.  We vowed never to order from this place again as the food definitely does not match the prices charged, and as there are so many other lunch spots to pick from, we won't miss this eatery."
1,This store is too expensive \nThey really get you on those buy one get one on the meats\n33$ for pork ribs I mean really??? You are paying more for meats with those buy one get ones and we just don't realize it because all we see is buy one get one and automatically think it's a good deal
4,Really good provolone Philly and I love the fries. What I really appreciate is that it's very clean and the employees are nice. The food is served pretty quick.
3,"Pretty chill evening drinking spot for the hip crowd. A little expensive for Pittsburgh. Amazing french fries. Friendly bar staff. Interesting cocktails and a wide selection of brews. Nice big projector screen for weird movies and (sigh) sports when the PGH teams are on. Haven't been upstairs but I guess they have dance parties too. Would happily return again here, we even found an open booth on a Saturday night. I love Pittsburgh."
4,Amazing meditation food.  Nice atmosphere music and wonderful service.  We'll be back for sure!
0,"I went here because i had a coupon and to avoid Stephanie street.\nThe girls in the line are rude! mean and have no idea how to give a good costumer service! they don't listen or put attention to anything you are trying to say.\nThey act like if they were doing you a favor.\nI won't comeback to this location! i don't care driving to the Stephanie location, where they always welcome you with a smile and staff is friendly and food is great! :)"
1,I don't get the HYPE.  It didn't taste right.  Never going back
2,"We ordered delivery from here the other night. My normal chinese spot closed early so I had to scramble to find another one. I'm really picky about ordering chinese. I wont try too may places.\n\nI decided to give Lin's a call. We've walked by a million times and almost stopped in a few times, but decided to not eat chinese that day, so I was excited to finally try it.\n\nWe ordered the General Tso's chicken and the Sweet & Sour Chicken. The general tsos was fine.. my sister said it was some of the best shes had.. I do have to admit that it wasn't bad.\n\nThe sweet and sour chicken was also good. The sauce actually has pineapple and green pepper in it- nice touch! \n\nWe also ordered 4 spring  rolls. (They come by 2's) Holy canoli those are the smallest rolls ive ever seen in my life! They were probably the size of my ring finger (length & width) I love a good spring roll but i also like to taste it too.\n\nDecent chinese takeout!"
3,"This place is so pretty... if you want to eat in a pretty atmosphere whether night or day, Modern Steak delivers. I felt like I was eating on a tier of wedding cake its so pretty. And the toilet room feels like you've stepped into a airplane restroom--Vacant/Occupied lock--and into a foil wrapped candy. Also, I LOVED the music they were playing... nearly all of the music played was as if they went into my iTunes and played choice cuts. Music is definitely a love of mine so it definitely made the experience even more lovely.\n\nDon't be surprised, as it's really pricey, but my style of eating is sharing, which got me and my friend 3 apps, a drink, 2 teas and a dessert for $59... not bad considering their entrees can go from $15 for a burger to $62 for a Wagyu steak... I know Wagyu is above Kobe, but damn! And then another $8 for a side? Ouch. But work it with a family style/tapas attitude and you too can enjoy without creating MAJOR holes in your wallet. Seriously, the appetizer portions are generous... I ended up taking leftovers of every dish... which were:\n\nCrispy Shrimp: Probably my favorite dish so far, but I wish the dipping sauce was more interesting.\n\nAsparagus Prociutto Pizza: I really loved the asparagus bits on the pizza!\n\nParmesan Truffle Oil Fries: I think this was the first time I had anything flavored with Truffles and I have to say, not a fan. But they were edible.\n\nApple filled doughnut dessert: Just okay. The Apple consistency was thick... wasn't feeling it. \n\nMy friend liked her Pimms Cocktail. And I've heard good things about a drink fittingly called Retail Therapy that I'll try the next time I find myself at Fashion square and feeling the need to drink my I-really-shouldn't-have bought-that-but-oh-well woes away!\n\nThe wait staff look quite sharp in their outfits, and were very knowledgeable on the menu items. Our waiter sort of dropped out on us but he's lucky I'm lax when it comes to service... because I enjoy chatting in between bites with my friend that I don't really notice until waiting for the bill commences. One thing that did slightly irk me was that he wouldn't give his personal favorites... only saying he'd help after we pared down our choices and what was flying out of the kitchen. I really wanted to know what his favorites were so that was mildly disconcerting. \n\nNext time I go I'm definitely going in the daytime, with the white and blue decor I'm sure it will feel light and airy! So I guess to sum this review up: So far the foods okay and I am really won over by the ambiance. After repeat visits, we'll see if the star rating changes. So Modern Steak, I'm on the fence, but rooting for you (aka High up the fence, but not quite over)!"
2,"I love sushi although I wouldn't say I know all that much about the technique, etc... just that I like when it tastes good! silly, I know. I have always had delicious food (sushi and otherwise) at this location.  The service I think is pretty uppity.. and I'm from Madison and work at Hilldale so that's saying something ;) I also think that it's incredibly expensive. I understand that sushi requires skill and high quality ingredients so the price will always be partly reflected there.. however I prefer Red anyway."
4,"In Caesars Palace there lies a little restaurant called Mesa Grill.  You've might of heard of the owner, a guy named Bobby Flay? \n\nOk, so this restaurant is not so small, in fact it's huge!  But not in size, in popularity and for good reason!\n\nThe service was fantastic, the design of the place is spectacular, and the food?  OMG!!!  The food is some of the best we have ever tasted in a very long time!  Everything that we ordered was perfect and yummy!\n\nWe started off with appetizers:\n\nYucatan Chicken Tacos Grilled Red Onion +Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbecue Sauce \nGoat Cheese \""Queso Fundido Rajas + Blue Corn Tortilla Strips \n\nOMG!!  Amazing!!\n\nI ordered:\n\nMango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak\nGreen Peppercorn-Green Chile Sauce + Toasted Pine nut Cous Cous \n\nMy husband ordered:\n\nNew Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin\nBourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter \n\nThe Tuna was cooked to perfection as was the Pork Tenderloin.  The sauces that went with these dishes were amazing and I can see why Bobby Flay is one of the best Chef's in the World!  My Tuna came with Couscous which had a taste that was indescribable and cooked to perfection, and My husbands Pork Tenderloin had a Sweet Potato Tamale that came with it that was so delicious it was like eating desert along with your main course!\n\nWe shared desert.  A Banana Creme Pie!  Yummy right?  Not as impressive as the rest of the dinner, but good at that.  Wasn't real sweet and seemed to be lacking something.\n\nBut all in all our time spent at the Mesa Grill was a Fantastic one, and we will go back again and again"
4,"I live in Vegas and had never heard of this place - but went with some friends. We all had something different and everyone loved what they had including me! Tasty, hot, presentation was great. We will be going back!"
3,Decided to try this place because me and my boyfriend didn't want to drive all the way to Pho Kim Long to get B\u00fan. Beat idea yet! This place has better B\u00fan than Pho Kim Long and it's just down the street. \n\nOnly complain I have is that the lighting is really weird. They have yellow and blue lights in the ceiling and it's hard to see.
3,"Great food poor service. Can't really order anything bad.Breakfast or lunch.They make a mean bacon cheeseburger.thick patty crisp bacon,good eats.As for service grumpy career waitresses with the entitled to %20 attitudes to go with em.Keep your attitude I phone in to go."
4,"This place is so awesome!  Great thin-crust pizza, assorted specialty pizzas and appetizers and other items.  Delivery and take-out.  Cool unique dining area.  Great affordable games.  Friendly service.  Best of the best.  Hopefully the city of Monona gets off of their power trip and gives these guys a beer license!"
4,"I read the reviews from prior people before writing this.  They must have stepped up their game, or the people writing them were diva's.  I've been through Vegas 40 or 50 times in the past 10 years and this is my first stay at the Hard Rock.  \n\nI won't stay anywhere else unless they give me a damn good reason to.  We stayed in the HRH tower, had the view of the planes taking off an landing, We had a King Suite for an Unbelievable price of $290 for 5 days.  The bed was UN-FRIGGING-BELIEABLE!!!  2 TV's, GREAT room service, Super cool staff except for a waiter in the Mr. Lucky's that I wanted to bitch slap.  Everyone else - regular folk who like to smile and make it happen for you.  My wife & I were not just a number.  \n\nIt was Mrs Caruso's first time in Vegas, so we went over to the strip, up to the old part of town, and just generally had a good time, but in spite of going through all the other casino's, we'd come back to the Hard Rock and look at each other as we walked in, and said \""\""home\"".  Because it was for us.  Christina, who was our 1am casino waitress seemed to intuitively know when to chat, when to stop by to check on us, and even refused a tip with a smile, saying she was ok.  Nicole, our Check out gal, was phenominal in making everything smooth and seemless for us.  Santo's, the Valet from Melbourne was a Great reference for my wife to help illustrate some of the differences between Vegas service, & Australian service (which is almost non-existant).  My wife, is also Australian, and we currently live in Brisbane.  \n\nIf you've made it this far in my review, you know the rest of the story.  We had a great time, it's a Great hotel, and it's made that way by the people that work there.  I highly recommend it here.  We won't be staying anywhere else."
0,"The dentist was very nice. I really like him. However, his staff is terrible. Not only was the hygienist extremely aggressive with the tools, she was also very rude and abrasive. I have perfect teeth and I have never had any work done in my life. I've been to two dentists since this visit and they have all said my teeth are in great condition. The hygienist at Alameda spent the whole visit trying to upsell me on services that are totally unnecessary for me. I have confirmed this with two dentists since this appointment. Then on top of all of it, they have been harassing me by email and multiple phone messages for over a year since I went here to schedule another appointment even after I asked them stop calling. It's a shame such a nice doctor has to be ruined by his terrible staff and business procedures."
2,"Well.....what to say ....\n\nWe got a deal on Itison for two hotdogs and a half pint of Innis and Gunn or a glass for wine for \u00a39. Good deal! \nSmaller than I thought, we had reserved a table and when I arrived people were already sitting there, which was no problem as i was early. My partner arrived and we sat at another table until ours became free, we would have just sat at the other table for the duration but the door was opening continually and a very cold breeze would catch you and so we waitied on the table further away from the door. Id imagine that this pub isnt all that warm most of the time and I am a total girl and need heat in this weather. We ordered two chilli dogs and they arrived with fries in a wooden box, nice touch, The cocktails here are only \u00a36.95...so yes i ordered a Margarita! was pretty poor to be honest! The hotdog meal was okay and I dont think i would have paid full price for the meal. Beer selection was okay but i have been in pubs with a much better selection. \nI go the impression that Jeremiah is trying to be the next Hanging Bat, but just not at good as!"
1,"It's expensive, and in my opinion, not really worth the money.\n\nWe got the lobster mac 'n cheese, alcoholic tiramisu shake, funghi, and rising sun burger. \n\nThe lobster mac 'n cheese was good, with nice chunks of lobster and a creamy but still liquid pasta sauce (and campanelle pasta! nice touch), but there was just so little of it. It came in the same small, shallow cast iron dish that their dips came in (as we saw at the other table), and for a price of $17, too steep for my mac 'n cheese wallet.\n\nThe alcoholic tiramisu shake was not very noticeably alcoholic. And the shakes themselves are pretty much the same price as their burgers, but we just figured go big or go home. It was pretty delicious and a bit too sweet when it melted and tasted like liquefied tiramisu, which was the closest thing to refreshing when I got sick of all the savory orders.\n\nThe funghi was moderately disappointing, the not-disappointed side mainly because I was hungry.. It consisted of a beef patty, roasted portabello mushroom, carmelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere cheese, frisee as vegetation, and aioli...what type, I'm not completely sure. It was $16.50, pretty large and beefy, with a meaty portabello...but still, a bit bland for my palate...there wasn't much sha-zam in the burger, mushroom afficionado or not.\n\nThe rising sun burger was supposed to be the showstopper...the idea of it sounds absolutely ingenious, and I was initially very excited for it. Built of a Kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado, it sounds like someone took a delicious burger and prepared it with a Japanese pantry. And the individual points were all present with the burger, but I felt like the burger was overwhelming my salty and sweet taste buds. The teriyaki glaze was way too much, either too sweet and salty or too much sheer quantity for the burger. The nori furikake was actually kind of salty too, which disillusioned me from furikake for a while...the tempura avocado was soggy and the batter, too thick and not crispy. Which I guess happens when you deep fry and avocado and then stuff it between a huge slab of ground beef and a tower of toppings. After finishing it I felt the need to chug my glass of water...so the burger cost me $17 and an extra trip to the bathroom.\n\nIn foresight of these issues, we ordered two sides of raw onion...very nicely, thinly sliced, in a way that let it melt in your mouth so that you only tasted the sweetness of the onion, but yet it was a full indisputable bite of onion. Delectable. Those onions were a side dish to everything that night, they just seemed to make everything better.\n\nHolstein's is alright, you know? It really has some great concepts with the creative gourmet burgers and alcoholic milk shakes, but a little better execution would be valued. I'd give it a 2.5 - 2.7 stars if I could, mostly due to the steep prices for what was a semi-disappointing meal."
0,"I went in today to pick out a puppy for my husband's birthday.  I knew I wanted a maltese or poodle mix, and asked about the two females near the front of the store (apricot malti-poo, chocolate shitzu-poo). The employee (older white female, red hair) let me see the chocolate in a private room. I fell in love with her, but she wasn't \""ready to go home\"" today. When I asked why she wasn't ready and when she might be, the employee was extremely defensive and rude.  I tried to clarify when I could buy her, and was repeatedly told, \""I ALREADY told you, she's just not ready yet.\"" Very disappointed, because this baby girl would have been the perfect fit for our family. I informed another employee about the rude behavior of the older lady, and she apologized, although she didn't seem very surprised."
1,"If you can find the place... Avoid it.\n\nIt's a tiny hole in the wall of a bar; which is acceptable, considering I live in Chicago and tight bars are our specialty.  I went with friends to see our friend Lola perform in her drag show of the evening.  It was fun enough as money and props flew around the bar's open floor 'stage' area.\n\nHad it not been for the somewhat under attentive bartenders and the overwhelming amount of cigarette smoke I would have had myself a fantastic time.\n\nNot being a smoker and living in a city where smoking is prohibited in bar and within 15 feet of a public building; I must say... It made me appreciate the Chicago law even more so.  If I were management; I'd figure out how to give your smokers appropriate areas to enjoy their death sticks, away from those of us who'd rather not die as a result of their desire to do so.\n\nIf you're looking for a good night out, somewhere you can let loose and enjoy yourself... You may want to venture somewhere else."
1,"Decent sandwiches, but what I really like is the fact that they are tied in with Everything Bagel's. \n\nHowever, why is Everything Bagel's always out of salt bagels? Seriously., I stop there at 7:55 in the morning and they're already out of salt bagels? A couple of times they said they didn't even make them that day.\n\nOne request, if you say you make Salt bagels and you have a bin marked Salt Bagels, MAKE SOME DAMN SALT BAGELS!!!"
3,"Went there last night for pick up.  I ordered the chicken pad thai, which was great.  Loved how they added bean sprouts and green onions! My girlfriend ordered yellow curry with chicken on stickey rice.  Yup what a great combo.  We also had veggie egg rolls, which are cooked perfectly, not to crispy and not too gooey.  The staff was very nice and will def be going back, and recommend that you try them out if the thai bug strikes!"
4,"This place is excellent! Probably in my top 3 favorite places to get breakfast in the valley. \n\nWeekends usually have a bit of a wait for a table, but once you order the food comes out within a couple of minutes! \n\nThe berry bliss pancakes are a must try! So delicious, with cream drizzled on top and in between the pancakes! \n\nThe California scrambler is also a GREAT dish if you are wanting an egg breakfast! \n\nBiscuits and gravy are very delicious, better than most places I've tried. Creamy sausage gravy with some thick and yummy biscuits! \n \nDefinitely must try this place! You won't be disappointed! Great service and amazing food!"
0,"My dentist in Chandler sent me here. In fairness, I won't be going back there, either. Both determined that I needed a root canal on a tooth with a dead nerve. Fine. Did it. everyone got their money (which, as a previous reviewer remarked, seems the paramount concern). A month later I noticed that tooth hurt - significantly enough that I felt I needed to go back. Thankfully, I only had a temporary crown on it but even still - that was a couple hundred dollars out of pocket. Dr. Hardy 'tests' my teeth and basically throws his hands up and says 1) leave it alone, take some steroids and antibiotics and 'see if it goes away' 2) redo all the work and put some medicine directly into the canal and see if it improves 3) pull tooth 4) surgery (not recommended). 5) Go to an Ear Nose Throat doctor and see if it is my sinuses. I just looked at him incredulously. He stared at me blankly. I said \""I'm not the one who went to dental school.\"" Why does it hurt out of nowhere? Shouldn't it not hurt at all? How can we NOT KNOW what is going wrong to the point where we're going to play \""Pin the Tooth on the Nerve Ending\"" three or four more times until we figure it out? I seriously can't believe with all that equipment - with all their diplomas and training - everything is as much of a guessing game as it appears. Don't waste your time or money. Dr. Hardy's 'gee whiz' attitude almost made me burst into flames right there. I'll find someone else. Thankfully there are several hundred to choose from in the greater Phoenix metro area. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one."
1,"I tried to like this restaurant but I just couldn't do it after three chances I gave it. The prices are cheap but what you pay is what you get. Nasty old fish,poorly put together sushi rolls,under cooked doughy tempura vegetables,really dirty floors,and horrid customer service. I will not be returning."
0,"This is the worst Starbucks I have ever gone to. They finally got rid of the disgusting couches that were a hang out spot for homeless people, but there is still a seedy crowd that hangs out around the store. The tables are always dirty, there are crumbs and litter all over the floor, the bathroom was gross.... I wish it was enjoyable, because the location would be great for studying. I didn't notice it being any quicker than any other Starbucks. I avoid this store from now on."
4,"I have a way of ALWAYS getting my orders wrong, or the restaurant is out of what I want. It is litterally comical!! Not at Jimmy Johns. I eat at Jimmy Johns anywhere I can find one, and have had only 1 messed up order. \n\nThis location is new, and I didn't ever experience the \""NEW\"" feel. Same great, guality, speedy service I have come to expect from Jimmy Johns!!"
3,"Buy pre-sale tickets.  Once you show it to the bouncer, you skip EVERY line.  I've never gotten into a club that fast before.  It only took 5 minutes to get into the club.  Now, the bar line, thats a whole different story...\n\nSince the last time I came to XS years ago, the music and type of dancing has changed a lot.  Its much more of the EDC crowd so its not much of the traditional \""grinding with a girl\"" anymore.  So much more jumping up and down and telling the person next to you how awesome the (insert celebrity DJ) and (insert B-rated celebrity next to him) is.\n\nThe venue size-wise is really big and the grand entranceway makes you feel like an A-lister.  And the pool area gives guests a breather from the hot sweaty mess that is inside.  Warning though, the last few times it was cold and windy out there.  On the plus side, there's a bar and some gambling tables in the pool area in order to hang out for a little bit and not fight with the bar line inside.  We got table service outside last time but we probably wouldn't do it again.  All the girls got really cold sitting down in their thin dresses.  The solution was either a boyfriend or more alcohol, both of which was fine for the guys.  \n\nOnly thing I can knock on this place are the creepy wall fixtures.  Reminds me of Han Solo frozen in carbonite.  But instead, all naked women looking like they're in pain."
4,"Best All-You-Can-Eat Sushi in Vegas!!\n\nMy friends from Vegas have been raving about this Sushi joint for months now and I finally got to see what the hype is all about.  If you are craving for sushi and sake, this is the place to be at.\n\nAs we walked through the door, we were greeted by the whole sushi chef staff in Japanese and were soon greeted by Mikey, our host, server and bartender.  All-You-Can-Eat-Sushi is available all day. Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $29.95 (i think).  We were there for lunch and you can order basically everything from the lunch menu.  Add another $10 and you can consume all the sake you want! Yes, that's all-you-can-DRINK sake with your all-you-can-eat Sushi which makes it a very dangerous combination.\n\nUnlike most all-you-can-eat sushi joints in vegas, this place doesn't regulate their 45 min limit rule and they don't force you to eat all your left over rice. Their sushi is super fresh and they offer plenty of specialty rolls.  You also have to try their pineapple infused sake...so smooth and pineappley....and a creeper!  Great idea for our next get-together at our place.\n\nBest highlights of our experience:\n1.  Fried Shrimp Heads: Crunchy and tasty!!!\n2.  Pineapple Infused Sake\n3.  Favorite Specialy Rolls: Double-D Roll and Mikey's Roll\n4.  Mikey our waiter was super cool because he kept the sake jar full.  Even had a shot with us.\n\nMust visit this place next time I'm in Vegas.  A short 10 minute drive off the strip and you will totally get your money's worth and more.  I don't even remember how many times I rubbed my belly after eating here so you know this place is DA BOMB...Pineapple Sake Bomb!"
4,"Vanity is brand spanking new, sweet decor. Reminded me alot of XS just smaller and more private... Didn't love the DJ the Saturday I went, but that changes upon the night of the week you go.\n\nBut my review is for one of their amazing employee, five stars for Matt Minichino! He was so helpful and kind to my friends and myself. GO MATT!"
2,"For a public course in Vegas, this one is pretty good.  Not great, not horrible.  There are other courses in SoNV and SoUT that I would rather play.\n\nPlayed it yesterday for the first time since May, and the course is in great shape.  (They just finished overseeding recently, and with the great weather we've been having the fairways and greens are looking good.)\n\nThe course is a bit narrow and there are a few holes with blind shots where you can't even see the flag from the women's tees.\n\nMy big knock on this course (as of yesterday) was that on #17, there is goose poop all over the place.  I mean... everywhere... on the fairway, on the green, on the cement, everywhere.  The geese love this hole for some reason.\n\nThe plus side is .... they have a really nice proshop and the bar/restaurant is surprisingly good."
3,"Fun, fun, fun...because I won!\nI was extremely lucky on the blazing 7's!\nI hit 7 7 7 about 3-4 times., winning $200-$300 for each match!\n\nAnyway, this casino is pretty nice. The crap tables were super full when my bf and I were there. And I noticed there were a lot of old people around. I guess this casino is where all the old folk go to get craazzzzyyyyy.\n\nAfter I won, i was walking around looking for some place to get me a latte. No such luck because Coffee Bean was already closed. Boo you Coffee Bean, boo you. \n\nI'm looking forward to stopping by this casino again for more blazing 7's fun."
4,"The best kept secret of the Bethany home 16 th St intersection. The food is always quality and super inexpensive, the drinks are stiff and well made. The atmosphere could be spruced up but then it wouldn't be cjs anymore. I go often and regularly. The crowd changes at around 9pm and gets younger and more interesting. Worth a visit."
0,"I don't know where all those people who have given them 4-5 stars rating, We went in there for the 1st time, from San Diego where they know how to make Mexican Food. We waited 43 mins. before being waited on and served. The food was less then mediocre at best, and the service is below average. 1st and last time there."
4,"How can you not love Miller's Ale House? They have ALL the things and they do them ALL well! \n\nLet's start with the service! This was my second time here and the staff is always ready to serve you and seat you quickly. Joel and I came in on a Sunday around lunch time. Our waitress Brittany was so friendly and made sure all our food and drinks came out fast. \n\nThe atmosphere is great they have several huge wooden bars and plenty of tables to sit at. They also have different kinds of seating higher chairs and tables, booths and regular chairs and tables. There is a place to sit for everyone whether you are a family (kids eat free Tuesdays ) or if your just there for drinks. Miller's has a great selection of music which I totally appreciate as well.\n\nNow the best part The FOOD and drinks!Talk about selection. Boy, do they have it! They also have amazing daily specials when it comes to food and drinks. They have huge bars with lots of different beers on tap or if beer isn't your thing they have a book of ALL the cocktails. On this visit I ordered a Bloody Mary. Which was yummy! It came with a pickle, olives and celery as garnish. I also had a drink called an Orange Crush. Both drinks were perfect and didn't break the bank either! I can't wait to come back and do a Sangria pitcher ( it's only $10). As for food we decided on potstickers for an appetizer. They were tasty and had great garlic flavor. For our entrees I ordered the Southwest Steak Salad. It was HUGE! It came piled high with onion strings, lots of tender pieces of steak, corn, black beans, avocado and a spicy mayo dressing. I loved it! Joel choose the Philly Cheesesteak ( fully loaded) it came with tons of thinly cut steak, onions, mushrooms, peppers and of course cheese. It too was huge and full of flavor. What a satisfying and fun lunch!\n\nMiller's Ale House is a great place if you want tasty drinks and food at a reasonable price. Plus the staff is so friendly and helpful you can't help but want to come back."
2,"A Coworker recommended Jason's Deli. I just happened to see one when I was by Barnes & Noble. Why not try it.\n\n  IMO they are kind of pricey. $9 something for a BLT with potato chips and soda is a couple dollars short of a full service restaurant. For a $7 BLT, at least give a choice of fries. Nearly $8 for the salad bar is not a bargain, when you could have all you can eat salad at any buffet. Even the worst of the worst buffets cannot ruin salad (well maybe a few)\n\n  I rate the quality of the BLT, served on a double layer of wheat bread as high. The baked Lays is the same quality of the baked Lays I eat at home.\n\n This Jason's Deli is enormous. I appreciated that it was easy to find a table and that there were not people on top of me.\n\n   I will pass over boasting over Jason's Deli to coworkers. There are better restaurants. My first impression is that Jason's Deli is good, yet nothing spectacular."
4,"We have used Bob's K9 Convenience twice now. The big news here is that Bob and his team have come BACK the second time! You see, we have FOUR dogs. They are a handful! Bob took meticulous notes in our first meeting prior to the visit. He asked great questions and anticipated our requests and the dogs' needs. We even have one dog who doesn't easily warm up to strangers but he did fine. We've never experienced  a service coming into our home while we were gone but this service was very trustworthy. The extra touch of giving us regular reports (emails) was especially reassuring. We added one other request. We feed a feral cat who lives in the neighborhood and Bob's service did not hesitate to tend to the cat's feeding and watering as well. Bob's friendly demeanor is especially appreciated. Well done, Bob!"
4,"Staff always greets us while walking in! Everyone every time we've ever been has always been upbeat, super friendly, loves kids, and has excellent customer service for the child and adult.\n\nBeen going here for years!\n\nDon't forget to sign up for emails and register your animals birthday. We get emails when our animals anniversary birthday is and often get free accessory coupons. Print all coupons before arrival from your email. Also some coupons from websites do not work in store either. \n\nWe like to buy gift cards from Costco when they have them. Costco usually sells $50 for only $40 and each gift card is worth $25, which is also great for birthday presents to a child as well. $25 in there gives you many excellent options for an animal.\n\nThese animals come micro chipped. Your UPC is in the animal, so if you ever find a build a bear loved one you can take it to the store and find its Mommy or Daddy. If stitching comes apart they will gladly stitch the hole back up and make sure your animal isn't scared. Super cute!"
0,"These guys did an oil change and managed to spill antifreeze all over the belts. They also insisted that my battery was bad. After a quick trip to my Honda dealer, it was confirmed that my battery was fine and Juffy Lube used the wrong setting to gage the battery. I tried to tell the Jiffy staff, but they were not interested. Jiffy Lube insisted they were right. Beware of these guys. You may not need what they offer. They cost me a lot of lost time. The car had a bad odor for a long time from the spilled antifreeze."
4,"Sorry folks, but as far as I know, this IS THE BEST sashimi in Montreal. In fact, I remember getting teary eyed at how good it was. My friend Ma\u00efko took me here for my first experience, and it was amazing, and not only amazing but when I think back about that night, I go to a happy place in my mind.\n\nWe started off with the Yuzu martini (freaking delicious) and then made our way through 2 long plates of sashimi, Chef's choice. Everything was fresh, including the salmon, and that makes a huge statement for me, because I typically avoid salmon as I never find it fresh enough. \n\nWe ended the evening with the thousand layer cake made just like my Aunt's. Happy happy happy. and happy some more."
2,"Pad Thai & Springs rolls are pretty tasty! I can't say I was blown away, but it was definitely good. I order one single Spring Roll, and I guess they accidentally made it a full order (4 Spring Rolls)... Well they went ahead and just gave them to me for the price of one. Pretty sweet! It's the little things..."
1,Very dissappointed after all the 2nd hand hype..... The Burgers and fries LOOK great when served....but are very bland....The peanuts taste better than the burger. In the end I put this chain in somewhere between In N out and a Wendy's...with In N Out getting the edge. Definetly not worth the wait you see at lunch time...Better off going to red robins or grabbing a 5 dollar burger at Carls Jr. Soooo much grease/oil....soooo little taste!
1,Where should I begin. They used to be good. I don't know what happened but customer service and quality of their work has gone way down. It's very very unlikely that I would ever go back there. And I used to go there a lot because it's close to where I live. But the last couple of times I was there it was just bad service and my nails didn't look as good. Today I got a manicure and deluxe pedicure. My manicure was literally 5 min. My nails look bad and he ( Mike) rushed right through. I don't know why he was in a hurry. There was one other person in there. It's not like they were busy. Don't get a deluxe pedicure it's a waste of money. It's the same as their regular one except its $10 more because they wrap a towel around your legs. Big deal. Rush rush rush.  Well I figured out why he was rushing me so much - he had another lady coming. I was in the middle of my pedicure when she walked in and he said I'm ready for you. I do not mind waiting if you have an appointment because I'd rather you do a good job. So don't go there. Do your research and get a place that will do a good job and make you feel relaxed and happy.
1,"This place would fair better in a town with fewer food options. The pizza is... ok. The service is plain slow. Location is great and they do have a street side terrace, just don't be in a hurry."
2,"My husband and I came here on a Wednesday night because we had a Groupon for $30 worth of food.\n\nThe Groupon said to call ahead with a reservation and to  mention the Groupon, so at 6pm I called, and was told the earliest they could take me was 7. I thought it was odd being so full on a weeknight, but fine with the time. It seemed like they were really busy because it was hard to talk to the hostess, who seemed in a rush to get off the phone. \n\nWe arrived around 10 til 7 and were immediately seated. We were sat (very close to) a group that was already there at another grilling station. We waited on the rest of our people to get there and I actually felt a little smashed between my husband and a 12 year old from another party. I feel like they had 1 too many chairs for the table. \n\nOur waiter was Quinn. He was pretty nice, but I think he had at least 1 other table, because we saw him few and far between. It seemed like the waitress serving the table next to us was a bit quicker, but who knows what was happening behind the scenes. \n\nI ordered the Teryaki steak, and my husband got the Teryaki chicken. It comes with a shrimp appetizer, soup, salad, vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms), and white rice (you can get an order of fried rice for $1.75 extra). \n\nI thought the shrimp was good, and the chef did a little trick flipping the shrimp tails into a used bowl, one into his pocket, and one into his hat. This was probably the only time he showed off. The chef at the other table flipped around the egg, where as our chef cracked them on the grill. The other chef, just seemed like he was having a fun time with it, our chef seemed not thrilled. \n\nThe steak and vegetables, noodles, and rice were all good. Not great, I think if we were paying full price for this, I would have not enjoyed our $40 bill. We did also try Saki for the first time (not a fan). \n\nWe will go back - if we have another Groupon or coupon."
3,"This place is awesome! The service is good, it's clean(which is hugely important when you're talking about raw fish), the food is good and it's affordable. We come here every couple of months for the All you can eat which is only $25! Talk about awesome! Now the deal is you must finish all that you order when you take on the AYCE otherwise they'll charge you ala carte prices which is very understandable, sushi isn't cheap and if it is you have no business eating it. So prepare to come hungry and leave stuffed to the gills. The AYCE is totally worth it if you eat even a minimum of 4 rolls, since at the ala carte price you can pay far more. this place is quiet and awesome and the staff is super friendly, we usually sit up at the bar and chat up the person making the rolls. If you're going here for things other than sushi I would suggest finding a better place. but for sushi this place is definitely a good spot!"
1,"After reading the reviews I was excited about trying this place. I absolutely love pupusa's & couldn't wait to get one. We drove 30 minutes to have dinner & was pretty disappointed. The pupusa's tasted just like a quesadilla & the \""steak\"" that was suposed to be in consisted of 5 tiny pieces. The beans were watery & tasteless but the rice was delicious & the staff was friendly which is why I gave 2 stars."
3,"Where else can you go for a Candlelight dinner on Valentines Day and NOT spend a fortune?  Yep your local participating Waffle House.  Tonight was my wifes and I third consecutive year going to Waffle House on Valentines Day.  They did a nice job of decorating a section with streamers, tableclothes, Roses and Candles.  There was even a table with Strawberry's and Chocolate.  Aside from being a little ecletic, it's a nice way to enjoy the evening.\n\nSadly, the dinner was not fullfilling.  Our server forgot our pies, we had to request them, and the staff was enjoying the chocolate covered strawberries set out for the customers.  I can't say I blame them, but when they are blatant about it, thats a little to much.  \n\nI'm glad that they went to the trouble of making things nice while still staying true to their own menu.  We'll be back again next year."
4,"I have never felt like an idiot while being in the store. The staff is always extremely friendly and willing to help. I don't know how much praise they get, but these guys should be tipped!!! \n\nI had accidentally made an appointment for the other Apple Store, but the staff help me right away anyways and brought my phone back to life."
3,This is another one of my favorite Thai restaurants.  One of my korean friends introduced me to this place.  It as a bit more modern atmosphere than Pin Kaow with some different menu items as well. The food is superb.   If you like Thai food this should be on your list of places to go to.
2,"Chili's is what it is, they are all basically the same, with only slight variations in details that make it better or worse.  I feel like this one falls on the better side of the Chili's experience.\n\nEmployees are friendly, they don't look at me like I am crazy when I tell them to please remove the hepatitis-ridden mini monitor things on the table.  Which is nice.  Good night, I hate that thing, too many people use the bathroom and don't was their hands, sneeze in their hands and don't wash, lick their fingers and press on that thing, and now you want me to press the screen to order, no thanks.\n\nSame food as every other Chili's, prepared and presented in a manner that is reasonable.  Nice servers and easy parking make this a place we return to from time-to-time."
3,"This is my boyfriend and I's go-to sushi place. Parking is easy, service is friendly and their sushi is yummy."
3,Good Mexican food. Great value!
3,"There's nothing particularly unique about this Flat Top location compared to all the others, but that's no surprise from a chain restaurant. The size of the space is good, the waitress was really nice (automatically gave us the student price - which itself wasn't terrible for a sit-down restaurant), and it all seemed to go as it should at Flat Top.\n\nThe concept itself isn't bad; when I was younger I thought Flat Top was the ultimate in food fabulousness. Now that I've been in college and made more than enough \""let me throw every thing I can find into a pan with some rice and soy sauce and call it stir fry\"" meals, the excitement has worn a little thin. Of course, the vegetables are much more varied and fresh, the sauce selection is massive (just don't think about Sauceman's from Tom Goes to the Mayor), and they give you lots of special options that most college students probably wouldn't be able to do. Plus, you know, not having to cook or clean dishes yourself.\n\nI like the place, I'd recommend it to people for what it is, and I'd certainly go again myself. Also, I've heard good things about their breakfast...maybe next time?"
1,"i'ts hard to give a place where you see a lot of boob a bad review, but i have to.  the food is pretty crappy.  some english & irish beer on tap, but i'm not a huge fan of those.  it's all mainstream stuff you can find at safeway.  i guess not a bad place to get a beer and watch a game if there's no other choice and you have't seen 1/2 a boob in 6 months.  but i wouldn't go out of my way to go here."
2,"Home Depot isn't so much a choice for home owners as it is a necessity, so if I absolutely MUST fix it, I stop here first for parts.  If I need it, they probably have it, from A/C fuses, CFL bulbs, stove parts, new bathroom fixtures, flooring, to another garden hose (aka doggy chew toy), or a dozen different kinds of herbs for my most recent foray into window box gardening.  They are cheap as can be, but even if I go in for washers and duct tape,  I never leave for less than $65."
0,"We drove all the way out here to eat dinner on the water. Because of the length of the drive, about an hour, we checked the website for their hours. The website clearly says they are open till 9pm on Saturday. We arrived at Dillon's at 8:00 on the dot and were turner away right as we opened the gate to go in. There were about 15 people in the restaurant still. I explained that we checked the website and it says 9pm. I also explained how far we drove. He said they close at 8, on their discretion and that the hours are subject to change. We (6 of us) just wasted our time and we will never be back. Management really should do something about this issue. BS in my opinion and we will never be back!"
1,"They serve breakfast and lunch. It's right in your hotel at Mandalay Bay. It is basic. \n\nWe had a dining credit due to our room being overbooked so we came down here to spend the rest on breakfast before we checked out. \n\nThe concierge told me this used to be the Mandalay Bay's 24 hr restaurant. Now it closes in the afternoon and has a very limited breakfast and lunch menu. \n\nSince it is an only partially operational restaurant, we stuck with safe breakfast options - eggs bacon toast and French toast. The bacon was tasty. The rest was meh but we were glad to have it in our tummies. \n\nThe restaurant has a nice ambience and decor - kind of tropical. It's a shame they don't operate it all of the time and with a full menu. \n\nI noticed the side of toast only came with 1 slice. I thought that was odd."
4,Dropped in to see what the breakfast was like here. Turns out they only have breakfast tacos and potatoes. They were very tasty and the salsa that came with them was excellent! They make the salsa in house. I will be back to try the dinner menu.
2,"Best Buys are closing around the country, and honestly it is quite obvious to me why. I see nothing but teenagers working in here. They are more worried about texting their bf/gf than helping close deals on the sales floor. In the online age, you have to do something to stand out. Texting, talking with coworkers, and generally ignoring customers is the wrong way to do so."
0,"On May 2, 2013 a group of friends and I came here to grab a burger before a movie.\n\nFour of us became incredibly ill only hours after eating here and we were all sick for 3-4 days afterward. Two of the other members who came with us did not get ill.\n\nApologies, I would have written something more timely, but just getting around to it now. I've eaten at other Red Robin's before and never had an issue. It appears it's just this location."
4,Totally awesome. Foie gras pudding pops. Hell yeah.
4,"I was skeptical of this place after reading the reviews, but we enjoyed the food and the service. When we arrived the line was long but it moved SO fast! We got seated within 10 minutes. Our waitress took longer to get to our table and take our order, but she let us know that she would be right with us. It was packed in there, and she was swamped with tables. \nConsidering how many people were there, our order came up in no time. The food was great, REALLY TASTY! Silverware was clean, she refilled our waters for us when they were low. No complaints! \n*we ate here for 5 days straight while in Vegas and Only had a bad experience on the last day, Friday. If you come here, ask to sit in Pamela's section. She's the best. Everyone else is really hit or miss."
2,"My first time to Las Vegas Chnatown plaza after going to Vegas for so many years!  and after being here, I kinda understand why none of my friends mentioned this place...  It is not a TOWN, it is really a plaza..  some restaurants here and there, but I guess I probably wouldn't want to come all the way to Las Vegas from Cali. to have Chinese food!    Don't expect too much when you come here, except maybe some cheap meals..."
1,"very large, very confusing, long walk in terminal 4 from gate D to C........long walk and no options."
1,"This is our second time coming here. We haven't received our food yet but I can say our first visit was better already. It was busy then and service was a lot better. Just waiting to order today was a wait and it is not busy at all. Food just came in a fair amount of time.\n\nReceived our meal and our country potatoes were cold on both plates, received one egg instead of two and my pork lion was  tough. This experience wasn't great at all but our first time here was outstanding which is why we came back. Not sure what changed."
2,"This is a small bar in the lobby area of the Vdara hotel.  The food was good, but took way too long for the price paid for it.  Staff kind of goofed off a lot and that bothered me since I was sitting there waiting for sustenance.\n\nAnother issue I have is that the lobby area would waft this overpoweringly strong fragrance that would give you headaches if you breathed in the aromatic fumes for too long."
0,This place use to be great but disappointingly it has changed. Much like recent reviewers there new goal is only to get you in and out in 10 minutes. Customer service is totally forgotten. In a rush they missed many patches that I wanted fixed but was never even given an opportunity to address . The owner is totally out of touch and has no loyalty to her loyal clients. She's only concerned with making sure your in and out. it's turned into a factory not a spa and don't bother telling Tricia because she does not care even though I was once one of her first clients.
3,"Bone Marrow & Oxtail Jam a.k.a. Bone Marrow & some very good/reduced beef stew. It was quite delicious, and rich in flavor. I had issues with how it was served with these odd, finger sized, crackers. It was really difficult to spread the marrow on them, as well as getting the \""jam\"" to stay in place since it's really decent sized pieces of beef. Also, the seating was odd for three people, so I didn't notice the sea salt on one end of the slate the food was served on. The marrow really needed that salt. ***\n\nBeef Tartare! Truly delicious. Perfectly seasoned, and a large serving. Probably more beef than my buddies burger. I shared this with my two friends, and we all enjoyed it. It was the favorite at the table. *****\n\nI highly suggest you visit early in the night during the happy hour. Great food at a decent price."
3,Fabulous and very affordable!
2,"Full review in the blog.  This place has potential, but thus far that potential is not fully realized.\n\nseven plates, four desserts...and a $1 'bread supplement'\n\n\""Shrimp and Grits,\"" a savory and intense composition of sweet and snappy head-on shrimp atop creamy popcorn grits enlivened by charred onions and smoky pork glaze with a touch on honey.  Sweet and savory but perhaps a bit steep at $14 this was a dish where the ingredients and the execution came together beautifully.\n\n\""Arizona Ricotta, Sicilian Pistachio Toast, Roasted Radish\"" at $8 arrived as a trio with only a single flaw - a dearth of salt to liven up the otherwise beautifully cooked radish.  A bit of a disappointment even despite the high quality of the tender taproot the dish certainly improved in moving on to the bread crisps as the ricotta was ever so slightly melted while the bread itself was herbal and crunchy but at the same time subtle.  With a bit more salt this one could be great.\n\nFor Duck Confit Meatballs, Foie Gras, White Bean, Tomato Agrodolce it would be hard to say exactly how/why such decadent ingredients did not live up to my expectations, particularly as the meatballs were tender and rife with flavor, but if I had to pin it on one thing I think it would be the expectations arising with the word \""Foie Gras\"" and the $14 price tag as the sapor of the foie was largely lost to the tomatoes while the puree of white bean was okay, but mostly just filler.\n\nBerkshire Pork Belly, Kimchee, Udon Noodle, Fried Egg arrived with some joking at the table about the ubiquity of pork belly these days and as much as I cannot argue that said ingredient is delicious I just didn't find it well utilized here as the fattiness of the swine simply overwhelmed any semblance of kimchee while the noodles were soggy and limp.  Decent flavors though garnished by a rather inconsequential egg I had a few bites and that was enough.\n\n\""Maine Lobster Fried Rice, Mullet Egg, Aji Amarillo\"" was actually a rather nice plate of risotto with a lot of umami and a touch of heat but \""fried rice\"" it most certainly was not.  Nice enough, but certainly not a sharable plate, one of my tablemates summed it up perfectly when he commented that all this dish really did was make him want to go elsewhere and get a dish of \""kick ass\"" fried rice - something he could have done at 1/3 the tab and had enough for lunch the next day.\n\nMoving last to a pair of sides, each $6 and far more generous than the rice, Grilled and Buttered Shiitake Mushrooms, Truffle Honey along with Grilled Broccoli Carbonara, Pancetta, Egg, Black Pepper arrived and where the first showed strongly in its simplicity the second fell flat once again due to a lack of salt - a lack so pronounced that frozen broccoli straight from the bag has more flavor thus making me wonder exactly what sort of pancetta was even present.\n\nButtermilk Blackberry Crumb Cake arrived as a dense butter cake with a downhome toothsomeness that I really enjoyed, but with ample notes of buttermilk dominating the sweetness of the berries I think this one could have benefitted from one of two things - a dollop of ice cream or a cup of coffee.  I'd definitely order this as a breakfast item anywhere.\n\nCaramel Apple Upside Down Cake, Salted Caramel, and Pistachio Ice Cream.  A long and linear presentation with the apple flavor a bit overwhelmed by the salty caramel but still potent and tart what truly made this plate shine was the ice cream - creamy, rich, and rife with nutty flavor...had we been dining earlier I'd have probably driven over to Sweet Republic for another round.\n\nUnder other circumstances Sacher Torte would have been the highlight of the meal and served with \""Toasted Almond Amaretto Mascarpone Mousse\"" this one was a fine example.  Dense, intensely cocoa, and appropriately dry without suffering the Americanization of making it too birthday-cake in texture this was another dessert that would have gone great with coffee but the use of the mousse and bold apricot flavor kept everything balanced and bright.  It was awesome.\n\nIf there is one thing The House should keep doing from this point until the day they close their doors it should be keeping the Butterscotch Pudding on the menu.  A fan of all puddings - from rice to bread to budino - and having had a number of similar presentations elsewhere this version was simply outstanding - sweet and salty, dense and creamy, and bespeckled with chocolate and fruit adding both texture and flavor.  It goes on the short list for Phoenix's best desserts and will likely remain there for some time.\n\nOverall, The House is off to a decent start but still has a lot of room for growth in every department except perhaps dessert and d\u00e9cor.  A lovely setting already with great service I think the focus should start with improved seasoning and working to nail the basics before experimenting with 'fusion' and once the kitchen is hitting on all cylinders perhaps improving the portion/price ratio."
2,"I know I might some flack for only giving this place 3 stars, but really....it's no different than Chang's.  If I could give half stars, I would give it a 3.5.  Why?  Because I think it's better than Chang's.  It's exactly the same menu (just not as diverse), but cheaper.  If you are at this location, try Tott's instead.  I bet you'll start going there more often than here."
3,"Surprisingly, the ramen was quite delicious! Don't believe the racist hype in yelp land. I lived in Hawaii for 8 years, where it doesn't get any better when it comes to Japanese food outside of Japan; and let me tell you, ANIME, rates up there with some of the better ramen houses on Oahu."
1,"After reading these reviews, I probably went on an off day. I got the pretzel sticks and lemonade. The pretzel was undercooked and tasted like a warm dinner roll with salt and the lemonade was really watered down. Had a much better pretzel in the bread basket at Mastro's later that night."
2,"Good pizza and friendly staff however, I'm not their boss but they always call me that."
2,I will say that the weakest link in this restaurant is the maturity of the staff.  We went for lunch and asked to sit on the patio.  Most of the people we're eating but then they sat a large group right next to us that only wanted to drink and smoke.  I know smoking it allowed on the patio but since it wasn't the only table available AND the rest of us we're eating food I think they should have sat them a little farther away from us.\nOur order wasn't right but couldn't get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.  \nMy biggest complaint is that we we're ignored unless we we're actively looking around for someone and then snagged someone as they walked by.  I will try again as this place is still trying to find its way but service needs to be stepped up for sure.
4,"I would have gone out of my way to stay here if I would have known how nice this place is. We missed the diner, but it was explained that its free with drinks every night. Breakfast is more than cereal, hard bagels, and juice. Its a real breakfast. Indoor/outdoor pool. Gym. Free wi-fi. Rooms are nice. Bed it not rock hard. Staff is very friendly. I will definitely stay here again."
1,Terrible. Just Terrible. \n\nAwful service. Comically horrible band. Way too many TVs. Music too loud and dumb. \n\nSolid beer selection though
2,"This place is definitely in the right spot. Vegas baby.. I don't think it would work too many other places. When you go in, your insulted, yelled at and have things thrown at you. There's a guy that walks around that makes balloon hats. You truly don't want to know what my friend's balloon hat was .... Then your waiter/ess may feel the need to manufacture  a huge/tall paper hat made for you out of butcher paper. They put it on you with out you asking or realizing. It's not till all the laughs and stares that you get the idea that something lewd maybe written about you. Yes, I did get one. The waitress wrote something about meeting me at the 'happy ending' salon.. Nice eh.. any ways,.. if you have a sense of humor, don't mind vulgarity then it can be a entertaining place to dine. Also, there is the bar man who does a water show to music. The food and drinks where your typical $$$$. My friend paid $4 for a glass of Sprite.\nThe place doesn't really float my boat for my personality but with a group of friends it was o.k..  One more thing, there's a stage for a live band. The time we where there, it was vacant."
3,"My husband had been craving Chipotle after Snowmaggeden began on Tuesday. Luckily after breaking out of the house Friday we had Valentines day dinner at Chipotle. Although not romantic, the food was great. They were out of chicken, so we traded up for the steak. My husband got the steak bowl with black beans, corn, salsa, and sour cream, while I got the steak quesadilla. \n\nThe quesadilla is technically only on the kids menu, but if you, as an adult order one, they will make it accordingly. Also the adult size is around $6. I thought it was very good, and I tried some of my husbands bowl which came with a side of guacamole. You could tell the ingredients were fresh but my husband was a bit disappointed for lack of chicken."
3,"Love it, love it, love it. Food is great can't stop ordering take out. This is not a Texas restaurant but as close as Arizona can get too one. Can't wait to go again."
1,"Just your regular mall food. It looked appetizing, but wasnt. ate here with a couple friends and they didnt enjoy their food either. Wouldnt recommend this place to anyone and wouldnt want to come here again."
3,"Oh boy. An After Hours club called Circus. Tell me, what do you expect? Before I get to my review, i'll tell you a crazy story. My friend Patrick and I decided to go out at 2 a.m. after our friends had fallen asleep. We decided life was short and we went out. After hitting a sexy lounge bar that closed at 3, we were desperate to find another place. We ran into two young people who were slightly buzzed and they mentioned Circus and Parking and pointed in the direction they were walking in. So we followed them and chatted. The woman, Genevi\u00e9ve, asked us, \""Hey, do you want to see our broadcasting studio?\"" We looked at each other and agreed excitedly. She and Antoine showed us their studio and we marveled at where Fringe and Big Brother Canada was made. Soon after they pulled a cab for us and sent us on our way.\n\nIt turned out that Circus is in a great location, right by our hotel on Rue Denis, close to downtown Montreal. We looked at Circus, the sign was red and glowing and we knew we had to get in. It was expensive for us (as broke college kids) $25 entry, and the coat check was about $2, but you just had to have seen this place. There were two giant rooms, one on the left was a legit massage parlor, tables laid out with half naked bodies writhing in pleasure. The bigger room ahead of us was dimly lit, stages of all sizes were scattered throughout and poles atop of them. Bodies danced to catchy music with beats to no end, young people, older people, and extremely diverse! I was happy to see so many people of different races dancing and having fun together. They don't sell anything alcoholic and water is expensive as expected. The bathrooms aren't too bad, just overused. \n\nMe and Patrick just let loose and danced our hearts out and I even got to have a romantic encounter with a French man who has never been with an 'ahshian' girl before! ;) The DJ played songs that built up and had amazing sound epiphanies that just made everyone yell and shout and jump even higher! It was amazing! Overall, this after hours club was definitely one of the best clubs i've been to--and I'm not the clubbing type of person. At all. \n\nAnd there weren't even that many creepers! What a relief!"
3,"I like Nandos as its reasonable and very quick, if you are trying to catch a film. The staff are a mixed bunch, but on the whole nice. I think that they are just young and not so used to dealing with customers.\nNot great for vegetarians, but if you like chicken you're sorted."
1,"This is the worst Teeter around, no questions.\n\nFirst of all, whos bright idea was it to put the Redbox in the already narrow  entrance way? Not to mention most of the morons who use it will stand in a straight line back from the machine totally blocking the door, instead of curling to the side to let those of us who are there to actually try to buy food, do so.\n\nAnd thats even before you get in the door, its all been said before me though. Over-crowded, stuffy, poor produce, ok meat selection. The basic layout of the store is moronic (ie. the deli counter area). \n\nIf I have the time I will drive up to the 24 hour in University, but most of the time get stuck here due to lack of choices. Damn you Teeter!"
0,"I Love dive bars but this one has gotten me questioning the whole concept of it. Firstly it had a cover charge.. Fine it was supposed to have 3 live bands and I understand that we need to pay to see them. THe last band did not show up. WTF!!! they should have told me that at the door. The band that was playing was more interested in fornicating with one groupie that was there. We had to hear a whole monologue from each of the band memebers about how they deserved a dollar stuffed in their whiteys which was fine as long as they actually played a song but nooooo... we will not play until we get a dollar stuffed down our small weenies. \""Then I will give a lap dance to the groupie and still not play\"". \n\nGreat!! and I had to be there to waste my time and money to observe this. Then I hear the last group ain't here. So I basically paid a cover charge to see drunk band members hit on groupies.\n\n And lets not talk about the turd they served me as bar food. The grilled chicken burger turned out to be raw and the soup was well... bleech....\n\nWhy oh why do I subject myself to this mishandling... oh right I like dive bars, food joints etc.... because I believe mom and pop type establishments try their best to serve people well.....\n\nParadigm shift with this establishment... service was apathetic.. food well.... grungy... and music..... blase....\n\nTruly a disappointment to my core beliefs"
3,"I went here for my birthday & everything went quite smoothly.  Our waiter was Steven who rec'd the blue lemonade martini which was nice.  They had a fabulous $28.99 per person 4 course prix fixe menu with 1.  appetizer of grilled artichoke or spinach & artichoke dip  2.  choice of salad  ( I had a tasty anchovy Caesar, my friend had the field greens w balsamic)  3.  choice of entree ( The parmesan capped filet med rare was excellent; the balsamic ribeye was tender & also fabuloso)  4.  dessert options were white choc brownie, apple tarte or wht choc bread pudding.  Of course hands down the brownie w candle was decadent, huge, & over the top with more'n enough for 2 & I had 3 cartons of food to take home!!!"
1,"Lonnie's has a nice supply of materials and tools, and if you're into jewelry-making, you'll probably find something to buy there.  Unfortunately, you're gonna have to wait for it.  Service is slow, and not always friendly.  The staff generally won't look at or speak to you as you stand there waiting for the interminable line to move, and they aren't any nicer when it is your turn.  I've been there many times, and this is the case every. effing. time.  Service is important to me, so I only go to Lonnie's when I need something now and they happen to be open.  Otherwise, I'd rather give my money to people with manners."
4,"Clean, professional, and very fast.  Could not be more impressed."
2,"I've been a patient of Dr. Sadlon for over a year now.  He's warm, friendly and open, but not too friendly nor touchy-feely like my last dentist (shudder!).  Sadlon is efficient, yet fun, too!  We rarely go beyond an hour w/ every dental service, except for the time I had a crown attached.  (Silly thing wouldn't fit...)  He's open to alternative methods and materials, should you ask him for options if you don't like the ones that are more commonly used.  \n\nTwo points that bring this review down to only three stars:  It took two or three visits to have my latex allergy duly noted on my file (at least Touchy-Feely remembered before the very first procedure... he actually told his assistant to change the gloves before he sat down!), and, unless your mornings and early afternoons are always free, or you live near the office, it's hard to get appointments set up.  Last appointments are usually around 3p or 4p.\n---\nUpdated rating down to 2 stars!\n\nDecided to take down my updated review on my own volition (and said goodbye to 4 \""useful\"" ratings!), but I wanted to add that I did not feel comfortable nor satisfied with the quality of care I received from Dr. Sadlon just a few hours of my posting of the review above.  He commenced the cleaning of my teeth w/o the application of a numbing agent.  I was so uncomfortable, but thought to grin (pardon the pun) and bear it, but when I tasted blood, I posited \""don't you normally numb the areas first?\""  To which he replied that it wasn't standard procedure, but he'd do so if that was what I wished.  I now know, days later, that what I should've done was to end the office visit right there.  Instead, his office has made a profit from the cleaning, the cavity fill, and from a few more x-rays to \""update\"" my file.  \n\nI wish this office success just bec. of the employees he has working for him, but I don't intend to return."
0,"Terrible service, we came here with high hopes and turns out,,, after we paid and jumped for maybe 5 minutes we were told that we had to \""have a shirt on\"".. My friend was wearing a crop top, with barely 2\"" of stomach showing with pants... We reanalyzed the waiver where it said nothing about appearance, then we're told it was \""part of the policy\"" by CECE,, which it was not. Warning, if your an adult and want to have a good time, do not come here!"
0,"I wish there was a zero star option. This was, hands down, the most unprofessional and awful place I've ever been to. The gal who did my full set took 1 hour & 40 minutes and messed them up soo horribly! My friend got a basic pedicure and all they did was file down her nails and put color on, they didn't clean up her cuticles or scrub her feet. I wish I could take a picture of what was done but I'm too embarrassed; it's laughable. The spa chair seemed really dirty along with the dingy towels they were using, mind you, this is supposed to be a NEW salon! The staff was extremely unfriendly and unprofessional in their conversations with one another and talking about drinking on the job. The staff seemed like they didn't know what they were doing at all, the gal who did my friend's toes had to look at the menu to see what consisted of a basic pedicure which she didn't even do. One girl was coaching another girl on how to do a gel nail pedicure. You could go to just about any other place and have a better experience. My 6 year old has done a better job on my toes than what my friend experienced. WORST nail experience EVER, SOOO disappointed!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
4,"Heaven. Their famous burgers, fries, and even breakfast."
1,"Not a big fan.   Granted, there isn't much competition in Florence, but this place really failed to offer much worthy of going out to eat.  Do check out the Greek Monastery nearby Florence though - very, very cool."
3,"SOMETIMES GOOD, SOMETIMES GREAT and always a little noisy ... the kind of noise that makes a conversation better.\nI've lived down the street from L'Assommoir for awhile now and have visited several times. They manage to deliver a really good experience, very consistently, with the help of a large and varied cocktail menu, a decent wine list and a moderate range of beers. The food is perhaps a little under-rated, in my experience its been consistently good to very good depending on what I've ordered.\n\nThe place is nicely arranged; a front bar and dinning/lounge area and a back dining/lounge area. They pay attention to music here, either featuring a live jazz band or, at the least, a good playlist. Depending on the time of day or night and the clientele, it can seem more like an upbeat restaurant or more like a tapas bar / cocktail bar ... I've gone for both of these experiences and have always left feeling satisfied. \n\nTIP: By license they can not serve alcohol without food, you'll need to order food if having a beverage. \nTIP: If you order a small generic food item for the sake of ordering a food item then you run the risk of receiving a small generic food item."
1,"The place is nice, good atmosphere and such. Now the food... Well, I've had better sushi, especially for the prices they were charging. The drinks were all right, but once again, they were a bit overpriced."
3,"Had the grilled shrimp taco combo, wow... It was pretty good.  I will be back!"
4,"This place is quite amazing. I cannot believe I never knew it was here before.\nMy girlfriend is crazy over growing our own food. \nHowever, we live in the city ,not the country so we really cannot do it. \nShe is certain that we can and will.\nSo when we came back from Italy last time, I bought 5 fruit trees.\nThe AZ type of fruit, lemon, orange, cumquat, etc.\nI ended up by taking back the grapefruit tree because, I had no where to plant it.\nWe ran out of space.\n\nThen we found this place, wonderful trees of all sorts. Now she is on a roll, we have to move or fill our entire land with trees. \nI am guessing we have to move. I think we have no room for more trees at the moment ,but when we do this is where we will be going for sure.\n\nIf nothing else this place is educational. Lychee trees even!\nI think she wants an avacado tree,it reminds her of living in Hawaii."
0,Can't do all you can eat by yourself. Seems unfair to pay more for just a single item on the menu when I couldn't get someone to join me and get the 15.99 price.
3,"Great Christmas eve dinner! Margaritas were ok, fajitas were excellent! Service was great. A fellow yelper recommended the guacamole... Stick with the chips and three tasty salsas... Especially the chipotle!"
0,"I am really disappointed in this place, but they are just around the corner and we keep hoping. HAHAHA! This time is the last! They just keep getting worse and worse. The selection is pathetic unless you get there immediately after they cook their donuts. Which appears to be once a day, some time in the morning. Otherwise, they're not fresh. To boot, they insist a bear claw is some kind of apple-filled monstrosity. In addition to the numerous times we have gotten what were supposed to be filled donuts and they had only a DOT of filling, the latest is donuts that they can't even bother cooking all the way. They tasted like wet dough  because they WERE WET DOUGH! These people are nice enough but they seem to not give a damn that the quality is TERRIBLE! Raise your standards, Arizona, a little, for crying out loud: Just because it's a fried carb does NOT mean you have to give it five stars."
4,Excellent homemade food! My husband and i are having lunch here right now for our first time and the food is so good couldn't wait to review them. So here I am eating my ravioli's and starter bread and typing. The staff is very friendly as well. We just bought a house out here at mountain bridge (having it built) this will be our restaurant of choice here! Glad we found them
2,"I went to this place on a weekend visit to Charlotte. Don't know why we chose this place out of all the other visually appealing places around. (/from the outside, it doesn't look very nice)\n\nI ordered the quesadilla appetizer as my meal and it was plenty. It came with salsa and sour cream on the side. The quesadilla itself was pretty tasty; the tortilla was nice and crunchy and the meat was well seasoned. I found a big piece of plastic in my sour cream. I probably should have said something, but I didn't because I'm in the industry and I'm weird about complaining. Especially since our server was very nice.\n\nThe place could use some updating. Some colleagues of mine had the tilapia lunch special and it was HUGE with an abundant amount of fries too."
4,Just moved out to Pittsburgh from San Diego and I was so shocked to find they serve Carne Asada here. This shop is a life saver when I want to have some authentic mexican food.
1,"Burgers are lame and dry, which is kind of a problem considering this is a burgers and malts place.\n\nWe ordered a combo with ($12) fries and asked if we could substitute onion rings.  \""Sure\"" said our server, but when the bill came we were charged an extra $1.10...   and the onion rings were kinda soft, not crunchy on the outside.\n\nThe combo also came with a drink and we asked to substitute a malt.  Same response \""Sure\"", but again an additional charge of over $2.  \n\nI guess our server doesn't understand that it's common practice to let your customer know when there will be an additional charge for a substitution...\n\nMalts are pretty good and it's the only thing that gets this place two stars\n\nI feel like this location gets people by default being right next to jobing.com arena, but they don't really cater to repeat customers like a local restaurant, which means they don't go out of their way to satisfy you."
2,"AZ88 is a tough one.  Visited this restaurant twice while in Scottsdale.\n\nKeep in mind I went early afternoon, so the place was practically empty.\n\nDrinks at the Bar - Great choice if you want a quick Margarita in the afternoon.  Drinks are made well with top shelf ingredients.\n\nDining at the Restaurant.  Food is actually pretty good (once it arrives).  The service is the real curve ball.  Took three different servers to get a coke and a sandwich, it's like they are trying to work as a team, but it just doesn't happen.  Our waiter was nice just not very good and awkward.\n\nYou get the feeling the staff was hired to appeal to a certain demographic, and beyond that they are kind of useless.\n\nThe Bathrooms - ummmm yeah, for a club in Miami circa 2002 maybe, for a place that doubles as a restaurant in 2011, no go guys, comes off really weird and tacky.  Mirrors, think mirrors !!\n\nOne reviewer mentioned the vibe is ultra chic, where you get the feeling they are too cool to just relax and serve good food, and I definitely felt that.\n\nSomething's missing here, and I am not 100% sure what."
0,"Maybe this was an off day for Los Favoritos... but whatever the case I won't be giving it a second chance. Because of all the raving reviews for their breakfast burritos we decided to try them. I have never had a burrito more gross than the one I ate this morning. Stale tortilla, greasy potatoes, bland flavor. Everything was bland; the salsa, guacamole, beans. We were both so disappointed. It was like eating a flavorless brick.  The customer service was subpar as well. The lady at the front counter was rude to us and wouldn't even offer a smile or greeting. \n\nAgain, maybe this was an off day but I was sorely disappointed. I want a burrito with flavor, freshness and excellent salsa. Phoenix, help me out- where does this exist??"
3,"This is a solid economical choice for lunch and a great Italian Beef sandwich. Get yours \""dipped\"" if you don't mind a little mess and want more flavor. The interior is also much nicer than you would ever expect from the facade. I will be back again soon...\n\nUPDATE: I went back again this weekend - the Chicago Dog is wonderful."
4,"I could eat every meal at Otro and never get tired of the food. Otro serves up big, unique flavors in a casual/comfy environment. Otro serves up especially good options for vegetarians. I've had:\n\n- Otro Salad: Yum! Sort of like the kitchen sink of salads but everything tastes really good together and the large size is meal-worthy with a little something extra.\n- Vegetable Tacos: One of the best tacos ever! The tortillas are soft & fresh. The filling is in-your-face-delicious - sort of like a mexican curry of flavors.\n- Guacamole: Really good but a little on the spicy side."
0,"Headline: Service killed the experience.\n\nI'm a coffee person.  I love coffee.  I love independent coffee houses.  So how does a coffee place get just 1 star?  One word - service.\n\nWe turned into the parking lot about ten minutes before the store closed.  I guess that could explain the surly nature of the barrista?  The milk had that slight taste of soy in it - causing me to wonder \""hmmm - I didn't order a soy version of the latte.  What gives?\""  I suspect that he didn't rinse out the jug.  The styrofoam cups were a definite turn-off.  The tables and chairs had all been pushed to the side.  This guy was just making sure he could lock up and leave right at closing time, rather than ensuring the coffee shop had - ya know - BUZZ.\n\nSeriously - if you want a coffee, go to Starbucks, or even Dunkin Donuts (just round the corner from this place) - this place is a definite pass."
3,Service was great. Loved the BlackBerry Pear Cider. The seasonal double IPA was delicious too. Wait for special guest Black Pat and your time will be amazeballs.
1,"Wasn't what I expected really. It's more like a mini-aquarium...definitely better/geared towards kids, not good for \""dates\"" \n\nThey also didn't have many different animals here, just two sea turtles for now."
1,"Stopped here before a show in PH. We went here because everywhere else seemed too busy for the amount of time we had. I ordered the pulled chicken, which was dry and bland. My friends ordered the pulled pork which was up to par, and the salmon which she said was good but she says everything is good. The fries were the best part of the meal for me and along with reasonably priced beer, was the only saving point for this restaurant. Service was slow and the waitress didn't really seem to care. She apologized for taking 15 minutes to get to our table but then continued to provide mediocre service."
2,"I had heard and read bad and so/so reviews for this place since it opened... both here on Yelp and from friends.  I went this past Sunday to watch the Saints game (I knew it would be on there!!!) and to try the food for myself.  Based on one dish, I would say this place is not as bad as the 1 star review on Yelp or some of the other slams I have read/heard.  Maybe after the bad reviews the owners worked on fixing a few things, but I had a good experience.  I ordered the Cajun Pasta and it was like Cajun Pasta should be: salty and spicy.  I liked it.  I am only giving three stars because I've only had that one dish... I will amend it when I try some more things on the menu."
3,"Stopped in at this place at 7pm on a Friday night. The weather was beautiful so people were out and the place was packed. We were sat quickly but the service was a little slow due to volume. We both ordered beer and mozzarella sticks. They were really good. Standard mozzarella sticks but the marinara sauce was amazing. It was definitely not from a can or a jar. We each decided on a calzone for our entree. I had the house and he had the meat with green peppers. When the calzones came out they were beautiful and HOT. Sliced open with a side of home made marinara, the plating was pretty. The crust tasted like fresh dough made and baked there daily. We both loved it so much. \n\nIn short, crowded for a great reason. It may not look like a gourmet Italian restaurant but it most definitely tastes like it."
1,Working in The 'Burgh for a few days!\nBut my room has a bit of a funk when I start up the ac...\nClean the ac condencers folks....
4,"Excellent sandwiches...the robbie and the cole turkey were fantastic!!! Service was quick, seating is really limited but as deli's go this is one of the best!"
3,"On my doorstep I have this fantastic bar, lounge restaurant. It is an old fisherman's building and when inside you are transported into the late 18th century. Thick bare stone walls and hard wooden tavern tables. 3 separate areas. But you are able to eat in any of them. They've got a roaring fire that I tend to seek out in the cold rainy days. We had a pub meal. Forestiere mushroom & onion & rosemary soup laced with sherry.. mmm deliciously homemade! Mrs D and my friend had a pulled pork with creamy mash and I decided on a homemade rump burger and chunky farmhouse chips. All was perfectly cooked, the pork crackling was so good I almost (almost) wished I'd chosen the pork too. My burger was thick, it was clearly hand made and so dense it was almost a pate! No fillers here, pure meat for the lovers! We had some lovely IPA and 70-/- ale and Mrs D chose a sangiovese red. Afterwards a sticky toffee pudding with ice-cream was shared.. as we were all stuffed. \n\nNote of warning: It is very popular with the locals and not surprisingly so.\nSecondly their meal offerings are geared toward fish and seafood. As I am a not a fish eater due to allergies it is a bit limited for my taste but the wife was exited by the choices and is definitely going back for more and I will too  and take pork that time :o)"
1,"Had such great hopes for this establishment. We have been here four times pervious and it was great the food and serving portions were wonderful. Unfortunately on our return tonight they have redesigned their menu and portion sizes. We questioned the waitress on the serving sizes and she recommended that we bring it up with the Manager since she had, had the same response from several people recently. We have pictures of our food from the previous visits, because we are foodies and like to share pictures of the happy finds we are enjoying. The Manager tried in many ways to tell us it was the same size serving, even though the picture was way more bountiful on all of the previous visits. We finally gave up on trying to discuss it with him and went about our dining experience. Nothing was the same even the combinations on the bruchetta board was different. You can definitely tell that they have scaled everything back to save on cost and possibly even changed food distributors. We are very sad because we probably won't go back and we had been so excited to have a place like this so close to home. We hope they change and if they do please let us know."
2,"3.5 stars.\n\nThis place is definitely outside my 5-mile radius.  In fact, only the idea of seeing some of my favorite Yelpers could entice me to make this hour-long drive from hell.  But if I do end up in a hell that requires me to do nothing but drive across town over and over again, I'm glad Siamese Kitchen is along the way.\n\nVery small restaurant with only 2 people running it made for understandably slow service, but they worked incredibly hard.  I did feel somewhat badly for anyone outside our group (well technically I was outside our group arriving so late) that picked that night to dine at SK.\n\nNow on to the food.  We shared spring rolls, chicken satay, and green curry.  The chicken satay was just okay.  The chicken was just chicken, and I thought the peanut sauce was lacking.  It wasn't rich enough for me, but neither is my husband, so I can't complain too much.  The spring rolls were nice and crisp.  The green curry was delicious.  Since I just like a little heat, I ordered it mild thankfully.  I guess that's true Thai mild, since it was more like medium.  But full of flavor!\n\nI would definitely recommend Siamese Kitchen if you find yourself nearby!"
4,"I've been to many burger places and eaten a variety of burgers... and I must say their Kalbi Burger is hands down the BEST burger I have ever had in my life!!!!!! My sister lives in Vegas so every time I come to visit, I make her take me to Bachi for that Kalbi Burger. The flavor and quality of the meat is just outstanding. The pickles that come with it is a perfect addition to the burger. And, Bachi also makes their own soda and it is so yummy and refreshing! \n\nTheir oxtail chili cheese fries are also to die for. I really wish Bachi would come to San Jose-- we need an Asiani fusion burger place down here!\n\nThis should definitely be on your list if you are going to Vegas!!!!"
4,"Non seulement les cr\u00e8mes glac\u00e9es maison sont de calibre international, mais c'est un commerce local qui a su rester humble et garder son cachet, un brin d\u00e9suet, mais qui fait tout son charme. \n\nLa cr\u00e8me glac\u00e9e \u00e0 la tire d'\u00e9rable, disponible en d\u00e9but de saison, est un must !"
3,Hey no one beats their olive oil and garlic they serve. Amazing! The service is good and friendly.. The food overall is just OK. The price point is EXCELLENT amazing value!!! but there is one thing here that is EXCELLENT (besides the brread + garlic) the seafood pasta diavolo . ENORMOUS amounts of seafood for the price and very very tasty!! Definitely check them out. They get the extra star because best bread and one exception dish. and my family members adores this joint so i have tried probably 10 different items. so i know what they are about
3,Loved it! One of my new favorites. I never order fish but the halibut sounded good and it was delish. Everyone I was with really enjoyed their meal and our waiter was fantastic. Dessert was great too. One of the owner's mom's recipes for carrot cake and cheesecake. I definitely recommend it.
2,"I think it was expensive for what it was, cause it cost almost as much as Sea World in San Diego, but its much less than 1/3 the size. The exhibit in and of it self is interesting exotic and worth checking out, I would give more stars if the price wasn't so high. Lots of different wild life and educational."
1,Read everything you sign and everything before you pay. If it sound like it's to much get a second opinion. I will not use this shop ever again.
2,"Pretty good chinese food but unfortunately for them there is a better alternative right next door in Kanbai. PM's food pales in comparison and often feels too \""fried\"", fatty and bland in taste. Initially PM was one of our favorite spots but it seems like the competition in the city has increased tremendously as more and more south-east Asian and Chinese students are coming here to study."
3,"Good cheese steak + good cheeseburger=SteakenBurger \n\nWhat else could we hope to see? \n\nGood sushi + good pancakes=SushiCakes \n\nGood Thai food + good omelet=ThOmelet \n\nGood Schwarma + good BBQ=SchwarBQ\n\nGood doughnuts + good custard=DoughTurd\n\nI can see we wouldn't want to go too far with this concept but it's working for SteakenBurger.\n\nI could have sworn I wrote a review of this place months ago. Are some of my reviews disappearing? The Yelp can't just give my reviews away because I have so many! \n\nSo SteakenBurger is a pretty solid sandwich place with big portions. Consider sharing a sandwich and fries here, you can always go back for more. \n\nIf they were closer to home I would go back. Ryan C's review brought me in when I was in the neighborhood. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty basic, service was friendly and the food was pretty good and reasonable."
4,The most memorable Chinese resturant I've ever had in US!! Witness every sweet moment I spent
0,"Too bad can't indicate zero. Used a Groupon. Food was poor, service indifferent.  Decor takes you back to the 80s but not in a good way (like a banquet hall of a Holiday Inn in Muncie Indiana).  Had fun surprise of additional charges on my credit card which I had to dispute.  \n\nIf you want good tapas / Spanish food, go to Tapas Papas Fritas."
1,"My friends and I were hungry after hitting up the club and surprisingly there are not many places to eat at that are 24 hours. All I could think of was Earls Sandwich but that was way too much work. Luckily we found out that Treasure Island has a place open all the time. The pho is only open until 2:30am or so but the american side is still open. The prices are jacked up cuz they know that at those wee hours, people are willing to pay. I got the club sandwich with fries and my friend got the chicken noodle soup. The food took forever to arrive and it wasnt even good. It was straight up average. The sandwich looked really good but after tasting it, the turkey was dry, the fries werent crispy, and the soup was just bleh. My sandwich alone was $15 so I thought that was overpriced even though portions were quite big. Well you cant really complain when you are starving and its 3am. \n\n**TIPS**\n1) Open 24 hours for the American food and located in Treasure Island.\n2) Meh food and service but no other choice."
4,"We bring out of towners here always. Great combination of super good, interesting food selections, cool re-hab architecture, and the  house made tonic and ginger ale always garner a \""What?\"" with guests.  Our server was a pro - and with a great sense of humor. The place beautiful all the way.  If your friends don't like this place, take them to Dennys."
1,Went with boyfriend before golfing and was really disappointed in this place. Took 12-15 minutes to get seated and there were 4 empty 2 top tables. Server was friendly but slow and messed up both orders. I ordered a green chili omelette with no pico de gallo on top (not a cilantro fan) and a side of tomatoes. Of course my plate w covered in pico & no tomatoes. Boyfriend ordered 3 cheese omelette with turkey breast added and he got side of turkey sausage w/egg scramble. She just seemed to be halfway listening. I scraped of pico but food was just ok. Eggs not fluffy and light like US Egg. My rye toast was good & Ryan's fruit and cottage cheese were fresh. His English muffin was tiny and seemed stale and the hash browns were soggy not crispy and hot. Go to US Egg or Butterfield's instead.
2,"I'm a fan of their coffee. Sometimes I think they put crack in it because I can be so productive in that environment. The music can sometimes be too loud, but that's why I like to go and sit on the west side of their store where it's much more quiet, but the new seats are very painful to sit on.\n\nThere are cons though. Their cappuccino is dry, and difficult to drink sometimes. They only have syrup for sweetener, so it's not how I like to take my coffee. The biggest con I have is their internet. I go here very often, sometimes 2-3 times a week and drop enough money there per week that they should be able to afford and maintain a good quality internet connection. When the internet is down, I can't work. If I can't work then there is no need for me to be there. \n\nPro: they know coffee. I like the pallet cleanser with the water that they give you for espressos. Their barista's are ultra hipster, very friendly and I think are hard working. I like all the recycled art they have in the store and enjoy seeing it grow into something for the community."
2,"A nice Starbucks, but no drive through. Otherwise, the same as others. Nice seating outside in the sun."
2,"Peter's Yard is a lovely little cafe in a brilliant location. You know it's going to be a classy cafe because of the black and white photos of bread and what not on the outside. Plus the interior is very mysterious and black, with slouchy leather sofas and low-set tables. You just know you wouldn't see any kappa trakka's or puffa's here.\n\nIt's within this that I have issue with.....it seems to attract a certain type of person. The type of person who sits in Peter's is either an intellect or a yah. Maybe both. \n\nThe hot chocolate, which wasn't that great at all, cost me a whopping \u00a34.20- yeh it comes with a little fudge slice but I don't like fudge. Jeesh.\n\nOverall, although I was impressed with the layout and style of the cafe, I really wasn't impressed with the prices and the atmosphere. There is a lovely Starbucks just up the road which has a far calmer atmosphere and is a lot cheaper - and that's saying something."
4,"I went in because my usual place was closed and was pleasantly surprised. It was very clean and comfortable. I ordered the Wu Shi spareribs and was very happy with my  meal. This place is authentic all the way, no tattoed waiters with long hair and pimples here. Needless to say, this is my new usual place whenever I crave Chinese food."
2,Everything is very plain.  Raising canes is better.
2,"They make your sandwich the way you ask for it.  Plus, they're fast and gave me a free cookie card for being in the health profession.\n\nThree stars because I consider Subway to be an average chain and not gourmet food."
0,"I really want to support new breweries. I spend a lot of time and money at San Tan, Wilderness, and 4 Peaks. I was excited to try out The Perch. The excitement did not last. I had one beer (4 Peaks Hop Knot) and left. \n\nThe music sucks. If I want to hear Margaritaville and easy listening classics I'll go on a 55+ cruise. This alone was enough to drive me out. \n\nThe brewery itself is decent, but it's in the ghetto and surrounded by trash. The appeal of sitting on the 2nd story balcony is lost when you are looking down on piles of garbage. \n\nWhile looking at the large cockatoo on the first floor, I was told by a staff member that the bird is 'a vicious animal, a face biter and he will tear your fingers right off'. Doesn't seem like the best idea to have this bird in the middle of a bar, in a cage with large openings, but what do I know. \n\nThe seating on the upper level is from an old nightclub. I remember seeing it for sale on Craigslist. It is completely out of place and uncomfortable."
1,Ice cream run of the mill.  Chocolates especially the creme tasted quite rancid.  Expensive disappointment.
0,"Ulta lost a long time customer today. I had dealt with my share of rude Ulta employees, just like everyone who frequents this store, but I let the instances go. This was the last straw. I came in last week and they were out of 3 products I came in for. 2 of them are usually sold out so I wasn't really surprised. I asked a girl if it was possible to check for any back stock, this was obviously very inconvenient and annoying for her. Nope. Nothing in the back. (Not sure if she actually checked) ok, do you know when you might get it in? Nope. I don't know what day the shipments get here. I was told to call \""sometime\"" to see if we had it. This brings us to today. I called. I was transferred FOUR times. FOUR. When the 4th person told me to hold so she could transfer me I said \""are you serious? You're the fourth person I've talked to.\"" And she replied with an epic \"" SERIOUSLY? I'm in the salon what am I supposed to do about that?\"" When I asked to speak with her manager, she turned sickeningly sweet and then offered to go look for the item herself. Nope. The manager was very genuine and nice. I appreciate her kindness and the way she handled the situation, but honestly a nice manager isn't going to change anything. I can get everything I normally get there from other stores, and I will from now on. The nasty attitudes from the employees isn't worth my time. It's very sad that Ulta is maintaining their embarrassing reputation."
1,"Gawd. We're too lazy now to just say two words?\n\nSay it with me now: frozen yogurt.\n\n*whew* Got that out of my system.\n\nStaff really friendly, but holy fertility clinic Batman, if you go here on a weekend, you'll feel naked if you roll up in an empty SUV or similarly equipped \""I'll be damned if I get a minivan\"" vehicle.\n\nI realize that I should get over it, being a single girl in Gilbert and all, but just because you bring your five savage children in, doesn't mean that you get to take over the place while your grimy, straight from soccer minions basically eat yogurt directly from the machines.  \n\n(Seriously, they'll have enough time to do this at their [insert fast food restaurant name here] job.  It's called \""the munchies\"" for a reason.)\n\nSo in the end, the yogurt's OK. I'll only go there when the adult to children ratio is manageable. Or the adults look responsible enough to care for their children."
3,"Great service by Jen, really attentive and very helpful explaining the options.  A bit on the pricier side for color 11x17s, but the same day service definitely helps justify that price a bit."
3,"The room is very comfortably arranged.  It welcomes you by opening the curtain, turning on the TV with mood music and lighting...Bathroom has double sinks, shower and tub. The best thing is I don't smell the cigarette which many other resorts' rooms have even in a non-smoking floor.  If Aria includes the slippers and jacuzzi tub then I'd definitely give 5 stars!"
2,"This Petco has been around for years. If I had to choose between large chain pet supply store Petco or Petsmart, I'd choose Petsmart. I prefer Petsmart's selection of food for not just dogs and cats, but for small animals such as guinea pigs and rabbits. While it would be nice if both retailers showed only rescue pets for all the animals at the store, not just dogs and cats, I had a negative experience at this particular location where, as a kid, I saw a mama hamster cannibalize her young! I'm not sure if it had to do with the living conditions or if hamsters just do this on their own, but it was pretty disgusting. \n\n-In general, for small animal supplies (Such as rabbits and guinea pigs), Petsmart is alright, although you can get better prices at Tranquility Trail rescue (And help out needy orphan bunnies at the same time!). Tranquility Trail also has dog and cat supplies, but I haven't really checked out the brands there.\n-For dog and cat supplies, the best places I've found are Sunflower Pet Supply and Pet Planet"
2,Expensive. Happy hour is only on steaks... I thought it was going to be on drinks so that was disappointing. Food is really rich but tasty. Good if you want to take someone on a pricey dinner date.
0,Here is my blog on my experience with them. http://coulterinfinitiaz.blogspot.com/?m=1
4,"I have been eating here since the place opened.  They have the best steak I can find in the Phoenix Metro area.  If the price were a little cheaper I would probably eat here more.  That is not to say they are over priced as you get a good deal for your money.  I've had almost everything on the menu, even the fried pickles, and it is all good.  The employees are courteous (and attractive) and the service is fast.  If you come later in the evening, especially Friday to Sunday, you could have to wait up to an hour but it is worth it."
3,Wonderful food fresh and flavorful.  Watch out Chipotle this new kid on the block is going to give you a run for your money. The tortillas are made from scratch in front of you and you build your choice of street tacos or enchiladas or one of each.  They are in a building that once housed a dress shop so there is a surprise when your to go order is presented.  I recommend this.
2,This is a very busy Denny's.  Seems like they put to many tables in there so they want refuse service.  Everyone knows how Denny's food taste.  It's the same across the board.\n\nI do especially love the holidays at Denny's because they always have the holiday flavored. Pumpkin spice coffee. It's a treat to me because I do not drink coffee.
2,"The main thing that upset both my husband and I were the sushi chefs. We decided to sit at the sushi bar because we both like interacting with our sushi chefs and as soon as we sat down neither chefs greeted us or even looked at us. We waited and waited but nothing. After the waitress took our drink order I decided to give it the college try and strike up a convo with one of them. He didn't seem very interested and when my husband asked if he could add sauce or spruce up the nigiri sushi the chef replied with \"" no, not today. \"" ummm excuse me me? You couldn't add some sauce to the fish? In our opinion they were both being jerks ( my husband used another word). I am not one to cuss on yelp but who does that? We ended up moving to a table because they were not nice at all. They didn't even ask if we wanted ginger and wasabi. Anyways, on to the food...\nThe sushi was not bad. My husband and I ordered the passion of fire roll and red devil roll( we added shrimp tempura to that one. )They came out fast and were both pretty good but nothing special. We also ordered the monkey balls appetizer and that was pretty good as well but still nothing about this restaurant was Amazing. I will be going back to Osaka as my go to Sushi restaurant. The waitress was sweet and awesome and so was the older lady that worked there I'm guessing she's an owner not sure though. One other thing, I was expecting my passion of fire roll to be lit on fire... It was one fire in the picture. Yes, not all rolls will look like the pictures but should come somewhat close."
4,"I can only speak to Steffanie's esthetician skills and her demeanor; not her personal training. I have no doubt, though, that she would be an amazing and inspiring trainer. \n\nShe has a space in a Studio Salons, and in her little room is where she performs all her services, including spray tans, makeup, waxing, facials, and personal training. \n\nI went in for a pumpkin peel. I had never had a facial service of any kind, so I was a little nervous that somebody was going to be touching my face. I decided to throw on an eyebrow wax, my first eyebrow service in over a year after a disastrous threading experience. \n\nThe pumpkin peel was great--very soothing! She also did great with my brows--I was so scared of getting them done and she didn't do anything that I wouldn't do if I could do it myself! \n\nI walked out with my wallet only being $50 lighter-- she was running a special on the pumpkin peel for $35 and a brow wax with any other service is $15. I have already scheduled my second services and I am excited to continue seeing Steffanie for her great work."
0,"New in town & I was craving Chinese food .. Seen this new place close by to our apartment & wanted to check it out.\nCashier/ host guy wasnt so welcoming. As I decided to see what to order, I observed him cleaning up a table. All he did was wipe the mess onto the floor ?! He had no smile or not even an advice on what's good to order. I guess Im use to some kind of \"" Aloha \"" since I just moved here fr Oahu which he sure didnt have haha & it wasnt busy @ all so some friendliness wouldve been nice. I did  like that it was an open kitchen so I could see my order being made. \nWell .. now on to my food .. I was ordering for my family & didnt want to cook .. I had this craving for Honey Walnut Shrimp .. I wasnt pleased with theirs. The flavor had more of a sweet tart taste .. not the creamy sweet taste Im use too coz the sauce was more watery. Walnuts couldve been more.\nChicken Broccoli .. My son's fav .. Ummm but where the hell is the broccoli ??? .. More like alot of veggies n chicken breast pieces. \nEggrolls .. another bummer .. excuse me where is the meat ?! STRICTLY CABBAGE !! I paid for egg rolls wrapped with cabbage deep fried !! Really & paid 2/$1.75 so not worth it ( my family never ate it coz it had no flavor or MEAT ! my mom makes better lumpia :) ) \nBeef with onion & ginger .. They sure overloaded this dish with green.onions & ginger. I mean Again Where's The Beef ?! SMH !! \nCombination Chow Mein .. Noodles sure wasnt chow mein but a different type. Combination meant Beef, Chicken & Shrimp .. Well I think there was maybe 2 pieces of shrimp n I dont know how many pieces of beef & chicken. But they got the dish wrong coz WHERE IS THE VEGGIES ?! NONE was in this dish ?! I dont know of any noodle dish esp chow mein where there isnt vegetables.. maybe they stuffed them all.in them eggrolls coz the noodles needed it. \nI spent a total of $ 41 for take out dinner which to me I thought I was bringing home a great Chinese dinner meal. But, fr my experience Id rather take a drive to Chinatown & experience a good sit down Chinese dinner for the price I paid. I was very disappointed. I felt I paid for freakin VEGETABLES !! & Im not eating in Hawaii lol its Vegas .. So I dont think Id be coming back here even if I had another craving. I still have leftovers and this is 4 days after. Im not one to write reviews like this coz I have a love affair with food haha but Im just being honest here and looking out for my other yelpers here in Vegas :)"
3,"Brought the kiddos here to check it out and found that they really had a wide variety of activities. My daughter loved the art area, the big climbing tower and the little pretend area (store, ice cream stand and kitchen). My son enjoyed the toddler room and the shopping area (mainly pushing the carts!). Facilities were nice and clean and it wasn't super crowded. I felt it was a bit pricey ($11 per person) especially since there was no adult vs. child rate as I've seen in other children's museums."
4,"Jodi has a most unique eye and wonderful style! I have used her now to do my daughter and my son's senior pictures as well as our family pictures. They were all so wonderful I had a hard time deciding which to choose!! She is professional, creative, always on time and exceeds your expectations always! I love working with her. Wouldn't use another photographer even if they were FREE! Thank you Jodi!"
3,I have to say we went there for NYE and had a great time. It was well organized event and all the staff was friendly especially on a busy night.\nHAD A BLAST !!! ROCK IN 2011
2,"The first time we were here it was for dinner. It was very crowded and a bit slow but the pizza was delicious.\n\nWe came back two days ago for lunch. It was reasonably priced with the perfect amount of food for lunch! For about $8 we each got a small salad and a 6\"" pizza. I got the bada bing and he got pepperoni and mushroom. \n\nI highly recommend the bada bing- it has bacon, fontina, white sauce, caramelized onions, grilled asparagus, and roasted mushrooms. YUM"
3,"Good lunch spot offering burgers and sandwiches.  I tried the pulled chicken sandwich with fried and it was tasty.  Served on a fresh roll with cole slaw and BBQ sauce, it really hit the spot.  The generous portion of fries was a nice surprise.\n\nReading the menu they only use fresh and primarily local ingredients and it shows in the food.  I'll be returning next time I'm in town."
1,"I'm a consistent customer of this place, but I feel like there are a lot of improvements to be made. I'm going to use this post as a laundry list of small improvements that could result in success for the business.\n\n-Credit card minimums: Let's move past the fact that the Visa Mastercard cartel says that credit card minimums are actually a punishable offense (pro-tip: if you report to V/MC that a merchant is using minimums for credit card transactions and a V/MC secret shopper confirms this, they run the risk of getting fined in the thousands... very mean pro-tip, but it's there for a reason)... So moving past that, this place is a quickservice bake shop and should be run like one. When the average itemized price of your products is ~5$ and your minimum transaction size is ~10$, it's really annoying! Renegotiate your interchange rates with whoever does your payment processing, but this makes you look novice and makes me choose a place that doesn't force me to overbuy. (full disclosure: used to work in cc finance.)\n\n-Average price points: Turn cupcakes back into a simple consumable or provide a rebate for purchasing multiples. The fact that you don't reward bulk purchases causes me to to purchase less.\n\n-Product quality: I saw in another comment on here that there was unprocessed batter... I've had that problem too. I've also had inconsistent coloring, hardening of cakes or desiccation (eek!) of chocolates (makes me question how old they are)! If you want to command a price premium, your product has to be premium too (not just packaging ;))\n\nIn the spirit of being positive, I'll say that my favourite thing about this place is the use of colour! I think that the Ladur\u00e9e-style muted colours on the counters and walls combined with the almost ostentatious food colouring (I love rainbow cake!) is sweet-tooth inducing! That whole artisinal crap that started in the early 2000s has made companies forget how much fun it is to take advantage of modern design and colour with food! (see Premiere Moisson, Au Pain Dore, etc). You guys have a young spirit, now run your store like you know what you're doing! :)"
1,"As a New Yorker, I was looking forward to trying out Chompie's since all my friends have said that I would love it. When I walked in, I could see why - The decor was New York themed, with the Yankees taking up a whole wall in the back and Broadway posters lining the walls by the bathroom. I sat down and looked at the menu, where I saw many familiar offerings.\n\nAfter receiving my food, however, I was disappointed. The Chopped Steak was bland and tasteless. I could not finish it. My friends that ordered other dishes didn't seem to like their meals either. The salad was okay, the fries pretty good. I would not come back for the food.\n\nThe service was lackluster too; waitresses did not refill the water often enough, and my friends soon resorted to sticking ice cubes in their mouth while waiting.\n\nVery disappointed."

3,"Effortlessly melding French class with a healthy dose of rustic charm, this trendy French-American bistro manages to delight the palates and unfailing expectations of culinary enthusiasts plate by plate. Whether in search of decadent brunch offerings or more savory dinner entrees, Sardine is sure to impress any quality food seeking individual with its menu of locally sourced and Parisian-influenced dishes. Inconspicuously situated along Madison's Lake Monona in the city's Machinery Row district, Sardine undoubtedly heightens the bar and earns its place among the best of Madison's food scene. \n\nThe inner portion of the restaurant is inherently unassuming in character and in most part relies on natural wood elements that carry throughout the space, while of course taking advantage of the views offered by Sardine's lakeside locale. A defining feature of the restaurant's ambience is the large wooden beams that traverse the length of the ceiling and contribute a sense of continuity in spite of the assorted half-walls and brick facades that serve to apportion the dining area into various subdivisions. The amalgam of earthiness and a refined touch of class invariably deems the interior space a rustic warehouse of sorts, making Sardine the perfect backdrop for an innately distinct dining experience. \n\nA sheer glance at the ingenious menu will enthuse the senses and riddle the mind to such an extent that skimming each listed entr\u00e9e will most likely result in an unprecedented level of indecision and self-doubt. To illustrate, a main source of Sardine's rising popularity lies with the glorious execution of its weekend brunch. Now, the institution of \""brunch\"" in itself presents quite the conundrum in that it forces diners to face the weighty decision of sweet or savory, and, more explicitly, breakfast or lunch. Then add to this the fact that Sardine's brunch menu consists of nothing but exceptionally delicious offerings and the former indecision subsequently escalates. And yet, this initial \""struggle\"", so to speak, with regards to the menu, is singular in nature, for straight upon that first bite of whatsoever dish is chosen, the earlier hesitation and reservations in settling on a meal are conclusively unfounded and without warrant. Rather, each selection is sure to defy preconceived notions as to the flavors of the various meals due to the level of mastery with which each item is prepared. \n\nOmelettes are artfully crafted with flavor variations ranging from the more simplistic to the increasingly indulgent. Fines herbes and gruyere cheese...spinach, roasted cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and bacon...arugula, brie cheese, crimini mushrooms and scallions...all of which effectively define decadence. Also flaunted on Sardine's brunch menu include such dishes as a warm duck confit salad, as well as steamed mussels, Norwegian salmon, and the ever-popular croque monsieur sandwich of bayonne ham and gruyere cheese. These savory selections are brilliantly supplemented with a few sugary concoctions that manage to find their way onto the same menu in a welcome fashion. One such dish is the buckwheat Belgian waffle that is served with a whipped cinnamon orange butter, sliced banana, and pure maple syrup, absolutely shining as a collective with its refreshing citrus notes and satisfying sweetness. \n\nAs a whole, Sardine executes on all levels. Enticing its patrons with a delicious array of French-inspired classics that satisfy both palate-wise and visually, compelling all who frequent Sardine to feel graced with the pleasure of having dined at one of Madison's top bistros."

4,"Yelp 100 Challenge * 4/100\n\nI still get mind-blown by Dale Chihuly's glass art deco at the Bellagio that hangs above the hotel lobby's ceiling upon entrance, an extravagant welcome (and topper) after any experience at the fountains that still leaves me smiling today. And to actually step foot in one of his galleries felt almost surreal. \n\nThis was the first in line to a series of galleries at Crystals place at City Center. As we got in, my friends and I were greeted with a nice, warm welcome by art consultants, Terri and Bravo, who were both very accomodating and ready to answer any questions we might've had. Terri introduced us to the acrylic lithographs that started at about $2000 and were considered the cheapest art pieces in the gallery while the cheapest glass sculpture was priced at about $4500. Shaped to perfection and precise geometry, I would argue that despite the price, it's well worth it. \n\nBesides the utterly expensive professional pieces, be mindful that there are other products available for purchase such as books, DVDs and even Chihuly art kits for souvenirs that are within the 2-digit price range so be sure to look into those as well. As we were about to leave, Terri handed us a catalog filled with amazing Chihuly's artwork. I'm particularly attracted to the Cerulean Macchia, a cute and colorful glass sculpture that brings about so much beauty, pretty sure it'd brighten any room."
2,Good food and fast service. Seemed very clean and the staff was friendly. It didn't knock my socks off but was tasty still and great for a road trip meal.
0,Came back to trade in some games and to buy a gift card. Got $95 credit for my trades and I needed a $100 gift card. Apparently this location couldn't use the money on my trade in card towards the gift card. I was told I have to give the trade in card as a gift plus a $5 gift card so both can to add up to the$100 gift card I needed. Funny cause the tropicana/jones location used my trade in credits towards the gift card with no sweat :-/\n\nJust another example why I give a 1 star.
4,"Wow, I love Nando's. I have to be honest, it's only a recent discovery for me but I'm so glad I've finally experienced the goodness of Nando's. It's yummy, reasonably priced and best of all; messy. There's nothing more satisfying than eating chicken wings with your hands and getting right in there to enjoy it.\n\nOn my last visit here I got a chicken wrap with chili jam and mayonnaise, served with a side of corn on the cob and some spiced mushy peas - it was delicious and only came to a reasonable \u00a38.90. Awesome.\n\nThe sauces in Nando's are phenomenal and I usually go for the hot peri peri as I love spicy food. I recently bought a bottle from ASDA and have been drowning everything in it ever since. Yum.\n\nUnlike the other reviewers, I like the fact that Nando's has no table service. It's exactly the way it should be as it's such an informal dining experience. It means you don't have to rush your meal or have an annoying waitress ask if you're sure you don't want another side, a dessert or coffee, tea, macaroons. Argghhh, leave me alone to eat! I love the relaxed feel of Nando's.\n\nIf you have any left room over after your meal I highly recommend the chocolate cheese cake - it's to die for!"
0,"I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!  Since when do hotels not offer hand soap in the bathroom?  (gross)  If you need soap to wash your hands, please open the shower door, step inside and use the the soap dispenser, step back out of the shower - walk to the sink and then wash your hands.  Seriously??  What no closet?  What is that bar thingy protruding from the wall with 5 hangers on it? Ohhhh - that's the closet. Yeah - I don't think that is working for me.  It just gets worse from here.  A three day stay = three fire alarms requiring evacuating the hotel including one time at 4:40am.  Did you know that it is even humid at 4:40am on the streets of downtown Charlotte??   I forgot to ask housekeeping how much starch they put on the bed sheets - they have pointy edges and are so uncomfortable. This is a \""Bring your own pillow \"" hotel because what they provide is rock hard - just like the mattress.  Oh yes - ALOHA - is this Hawaii?? No, this is Charlotte and they say ALOHA to you ever time you pass the front desk.  Can you say ALOHA with a southern accent?  STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL."
3,"Checked out the new location which is much nicer and roomier than the old one. I loved everything again and their homemade jams from scratch is the most amazing thing ever! \n\nInitially I gave them 5 stars but I decided on 4 this time because almost their entire menu has nothing but pork! Come on, not everyone eats pork! :("
2,"Went here with the family to compare this store with the same franchise in California.   I have to say the food just isn't up to par, and we prefer the Simi Valley branch the best.  \n\nThe fried eggroll was not as good.  And used a different eggroll wrapper which makes a huge difference.  The order came with 4 rolls... The Simi Valley branch comes with 5 rolls.  \n\nWe ordered Pho and dry noodles with bbq pork.   No complaints with the Pho, the broth was good, hot, & tasty.   However the other dish...the noodles with bbq was served burnt.   It was inedible.   I thought my son was exaggerating, but he was right.  All I could taste was badly charred meat.  I don't think burnt food should leave the kitchen and served.  \n\nFinally the prices were higher here in LV than in Ca... Like 25% more.   We had to even review our bill and ask the store owner about the difference.  We were told they raised prices recently.  So be sure to check out the prices.\n\nNext time we're out in Vegas I'd like to try out a different Pho place.   I hope Yelpers can steer us to THE best pho place in town."
2,"Haze is small, dark, and crowded, much like every other club in Vegas that's not Marquee or XS. I think my experience was much more fun than some of the other reviewers because there was no cover and the promoter gave us a lot of free drink tickets. Without the tickets, the drinks would have been pretty expensive.\n\nAnyways, the club was super tiny and hot, but I went with a fun group of people, so we had a good time just dancing stupid. Met some friendly people, took advantage of the drink tickets, and had a fun time. The go-go dancers were kind of funny. I think they were trying to be sexy, given that they weren't wearing very much, but I guess I find the idea of go-go dancers to be kind of hilariously absurd, so there's that."
0,This company has terrible customer service as far as I'm concerned. They also made a firearm ammunition sale to me that was not according to federal law. I consider myself a reasonable person and understand people make mistakes. It is a very fun place to visit but their selling practices and and customer service on the management level are absolutely unacceptable.
2,"I ordered delivery from here last night although they took about 45minutes to get here, it was worth the wait. \n\nWe ordered:\nFlamingo Special Chicken: Delicious, chicken was crunchy and juicy. \nChicken Chow Mein: My son loved it he loves noodles and I tasted it it was tasty. \nWonton Soup: Husband is a new yorker so he wasn't very impressed he thought the meat had too much fat still on it but thought it was okay. \n\nI'd give it 3 stars because they took so long and because my husband wasn't"
4,"Service was amazing, the ambiance excellent and the food was off the charts. Best Prime rib dip I have ever had and the teams that served were tight and knowledgeable. Management was out and about ensuring everyone was happy and enjoying the menu to the max. We loved what we ordered and rubbernecked a ton of other yummy sights we saw go to other tables. Will go back and try other things! Go! You will not be disappointed!"
4,Love this place.  Love all the food and the staff is great.  We drive from Gilbert to have lunch at Postino's Arcadia.  We understand a new location here in Gilbert will be opening soon.  Can hardly wait. I do recommend this place to everyone I meet.
2,This is a cool place. The prices are good and the food was good. I would not drive across town for it but i enjoyed the eggs Benedict with chipolte hollandaise. It also came with rosemary potato's which were very tasty. They have a smaller menu but they had a 3-4 things i want to try. You walk in order at the counter and they give you a number and they bring it out to you. There is a good amount of seating including a patio outside. Its worth a try. Ill be back!!!
3,"Saw the high Yelp reviews for this place, and we were staying in the adjoining Main Street Station, so we ended up in here for dinner one night.  We got there around 7, and there was a line of maybe a dozen folks ahead of us.\n\nI had the saimin (good, but nothing special), as well as the garlic chicken.  GF got the combo plate that had Korean beef and chicken, along with the obligatory rice and macaroni salad.  This isn't fine dining by any stretch - presentation isn't really a concern, and we're not talking about any crazy complimentary flavors or subtle undertones or anything.  Portions are large - GF and I could easily have just split the combo plate and been more than full.  Solid, stick-to-your-ribs, Hawaiian style food.  The beef and chicken were solid, maybe a bit fatty, but that's to be expected.\n\nCash only was a bit of a surprise, but fortunately I hadn't handed over all my money on the blackjack tables.\n\nThis is one of those places that looks like a hole in the wall, but looks like it's always packed.  Large portions and great bang for the buck.  Not amazing food, but a great value, especially if you're craving Hawaiian style."
0,"If you want to pay $10 for a small bowl of noodles , come here . I still cannot believe a family of 6 each having a bowl of noodles cost $98\n\nThe place got ok reviews and we thought we would give them a try \n\nNever again !"
1,"Cute decor but way overpriced for what you get...having eaten many a Mediterranean meal before moving to Madison, the flavors disappointed.  Pita tasted store bought and hummus was bland.  The taziki was very thin and also lacking in flavor.  While it wasn't a bad meal it wasn't good enough for a return visit.  I also thought it was a bit unusual to ask for the specials and instead of telling me, the waiter handed me his notes.  A hummus app, two kabob meals and a root beer (salad and soup were not included in the meal as we thought we read in the menu) came to $48.  Nice staff but overall a disappointing meal."
2,"Been here a few times and the sushi itself is pretty decent.  Sitting outside on the side, not front, is nice.  The service tends to be a little slow and disorganized.  They brought the food out in a very strange order so half of us were always without, party of 6.  We had a good time nonetheless.  The rolls are ok, although I am more of a sashimi and nigiri guy.  The yellowtail sashimi was fresh, nigiris were what you would expect, miso soup could be better.  I had an unfiltered sake that was good.  Overall, not nearly the best sushi or ambiance around but not bad given the location and decent to good sushi."
2,"This is a great place for a large group of people with different tastes since  their menu has a good selection of pastas, steaks, seafood and salads.  I thought the prices were fair based on the portion size however, the overall taste was average."
3,"The only things I don't care for are the booths are not very comfortable, like reverse ergonomics. And the catsup is very watered down and bland. The food is aplenty and very fresh and hot. The service is still friendly and the sweet iced tea is great as well, not bitter at all unlink many restaurants."
0,"I went  here while visiting from the Bay area with my boyfirend and his borther....we wanted some bomb bbq and figured Arizona should have some good places,,,,or at least decent... We came to big Earl's super hungry ready to chomp on some good 'ol bbq.. We came,sat down looked at the menu,ordered then looked up the reviews on Yelp....damn we should have done that first... We all ordered the ribless combo for $21.99.............................................. Man were we all bummed when we tasted our food....it was pale and soooooo dry and had a lot of fat. We tried dousing the meat with the bbq sauce to make it less dry but the bbq sauce is so terrible that it makes it worse...  We each had briskit,hot links, pulled chicken, and pulled pork...we spent $84.00 and, in the end  took it as acomplete loss...we left about 85% of our food. We've eaten bbq from all over the country and have come across a few not so good ones but when corn bread is the only thing that saves you from stravation at a bbq spot when theres a huge plate of meat in front of you...theres an issue.. Dont go there........... Seriously... Its bad... Quite disappointing,...."
1,definitely overpriced! chicken noodle soup was $8 and it was all broth..da burger wit little fries was $15. da only reason we ate here was because its close to our room since we stayed @ bellagio and it was 5 am and we wer drunk & hungry.
1,"So disappointed in this waterpark!  This was the final one we had to hit on the local waterpark rounds.  First off, it's the most expensive.  We added the extended pass for $1 more,  but still twice the price as the others.  The lines were HORRENDOUS!  And it was a Monday, can't imagine you ride more than two rides on a weekend.  IDK but they seemed to wait forever before sending the next rider down, so maybe they need to work on their timing.  Also, I think they purposely do not have enough inner tubes, so you have to rent one or you are waiting in a forever line just to get a tube.\n\nThe rides here are pretty tame.  Having experienced Wet n Wild in Vegas, I was expecting this one to also have more to offer in the adrenaline department.  The only screaming came from the freakishly cold water.   I do have to say this is the cleanest waterpark I have ever seen.  It is by far the furthest away from me, and not sure if it's even worth it to drive all the way over there- even if it is free."
4,"Wow. I've been a long time customer and have always loved the food, but this past weekend I was blown away! I ordered the roasted pork burrito - with red sauce (which I confirmed was the milder of the two that day) and it was probably THE best Mexican meal I've had to date. The pork was soooo tender and flavorful. I'm going back this week!"
1,"this place has potential. the food was okay, not the greatest. but not the worst."
0,Once again. Order delivered wrong. Who's the fool now. Ok...I'll quit ordering from there. smh
0,The worst experience I've ever had in Las Vegas not clean elevator keeps sucking no signs to help people this is the real worst experience for me I've been going to Vegas a lot every time I visit a new hotel and casino to see which one is the best so far I will never come back here I don't recommend this place
4,"This is a steak house the way real steak houses used to be. \n\nDefinitely for the more mature crowd...as we are....pushing 50! Loud, dark, excellent service, wonderful food. We came with friends, and would probably not come alone, as it does get loud with crowded tables....definitely would not bring kids.\n\nSome yelpers have said that when they arrive, even with a ressie, they have to wait. We must have been lucky....we were seated immediately for our Saturday night 6:45 ressie. I'm not sure you could get into this place with out one. Oh! And they have valet parking for $7.00( a bit steep)...but there wasn't a spot to be found.\n\nI was very impressed with the food quality...as we started off with a huge plate of onion skins, courtesy of yelp. At the table they give you sliced bagel crisps and rye bread.\n\nI ordered the prime rib 12 oz medium rare with a side Caesar salad, mayo cole slaw,  and baked potato. Unfortunately they ran out of baked potatoes so I got potatoes au gratin. My steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I see why everyone loves the coleslaw....one of our guests said that he hadn't eaten a steak this good in a very long time.\n\nDon and Charlie's isn't for everyone, it's not trendy or gourmet....it's just solid good steaks and ribs, older crowd atmosphere, with excellent service you should expect from a great restaurant."
1,"Usually this place is good. I like it better than Chipotle but tonight was honestly just terrible. I ordered a burrito online and everything was correct, picked it up 15 minutes later. When I got home all it had on it was shredded beef, guacamole, beans and rice! I ordered a burrito with roasted corn salsa, cheese, guacamole, beans and rice, ancho chile sauce. The rice was extremely hard and the avocado tasted terrible. I just can't believe that I was charge $7+ dollars for a burrito that didn't even have half the things I ordered! I won't be going here anytime soon. If you can't get a burrito correct than why are you working there?!"
3,"Edinburgh has a few good gyms. One might be tempted at first to avoid what is essentially a student gym however the Centre for Sport and Exercise (or CSE) is worth a try if you're \""shopping\"" for gyms.\nThe CSE was the first gym I tried when I moved to Edinburgh. I have always been apprehensive about joining gyms but the CSE did its best to make me feel welcome\n\nCSE is well attended by non-students. There is a great variety of cliental which does a lot to make you feel comfortable, whatever you are there to do. Some gyms can feel competitive and mascho, CSE is far from this. Of course there is always a little showing off, but the cosmopolitan and diverse nature of trainers keeps this to a minimum.\n\nThe gym is well equipped, apart from the standard equipment (which it provides well) to be expected the CSE also contains a dance studio, squash courts, climbing wall, boxing facility and archery and rifle range. All this for \u00a395 (full membership) or \u00a345 (off-peak membership), which is a great price for a city centre gym.\n\nThe CSE also offers a range of other essential services such physiotherapy and sports massage as well as quick advise from trainers whenever you need it, or full work out plans if you're new to gyms or just want a reanalysis.\n\nA well-staffed, well-equiped, clean and professional gym."
0,"Was excited to visit this place because I love desserts and dessert drinks.  My husband invited a group of people to meet us there after dinner. My sister in law and I walked right in, but my husband and a friend were stopped and told they were not within the dress code. My husband wore jeans, a sweater and dress shoes and was both confused and irritated; we have been to lounges and places  in Hollywood with him dressed the same way and have never encountered a dress code problem.  To make matters worse, when my husband pointed out that there was a \""fairer skinned\"" person right before us, who was let in wearing a T-shirt, the manager simply said, \""To imply that I am a racist is ridiculous.\"" He then told us to leave and later threatened to call the police.  This type of treatment was extremely disappointing; and to think, I thought Charlotte was considered the \""New South.\"""
4,"Friendly and informative front desk staff, beautiful waiting space in the entryway, need a few details looked after like their too-dark elevators, but their conference washrooms were clean and the Jackie Robinson room was absolutely beautiful whether it be for a conference meeting or small wedding reception. Gorgeous view and window fixtures make it perfect for any time of day."
3,Hidden gem. Atmosphere is great. Cozy place. I visited on a Thursday so wasn't very busy. Took a look at the menu and was explained everything. Ordered and sat down. Grabbed my drink and while waiting they brought a granola appetizer while we waited for our food. Granola was amazing. \n\n\nI ordered the breakfast burrito. \nGreat portions and very tasty. Added the chorizo for a little kick. Was highly recommended and didn't disappoint. Flavors were all there and the burrito didn't stand a chance. \n\nAfter my burrito tried the popular Nutella/banana br\u00fbl\u00e9e. A tad sweet if you're not used to it but delicious nonetheless. Highly recommend it. \n\n\nOverall great experience and will gladly visit again. Love the environment and absolutely enjoyed my meal.
4,"You have to love Molly's Tamales for their sheer creativity! A vegan tamale, YES please! And they have so many yummy choices for us veggies! Where else can you find a spicy salmon tamale? If you love tamales, you gotta try this place! Start a new tradition for the holidays!"
0,I stayed at the Cosmo hotel and was wrongfully ejected out of the Marque and the bouncers bullied me up to my room while telling me I was a homosexual and my wife was naked inside the room having sex with another guy.  \n\nHotel management refused to make amends.\n\nHere is the video to prove it.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E4jPBXiFpI&feature=youtube_gdata_player
2,Great concept in theory and a very nice ambience with great bartenders but pricey drinks and overpriced small portioned average quality food options. It's not the worst... Nonsmoking at least. Maybe for happy hour drinks (happy hour food still overpriced for what you get).
1,"Our first meal in Scottsdale was at Bacon--and interestingly enough bacon seemed to become the theme of our entire trip. Bacon chocolate chip cookies, bacon brittle, bacon-infused vodka, and bacon Bloody Mary's? They're all available somewhere in Scottsdale, but you can find the famous Bacon Bloody Mary here at Bacon.\n\nThis is a cool space for a breakfast spot, with indoor-outdoor seating and lots of light. Our server, who seemed to be a bit overworked since he was the only waiter, was very friendly and welcoming. We ended up ordering one of their special bacon eggs Benedict with a Mornay sauce to share, plus a side of fruit, and the main reason we'd come here: the Bacon Bloody Mary.\n\nWhile my sweetie was in the restroom, his Bacon Bloody Mary arrived. It looked great, even though Bloody Mary's are not my thing, with a nice stalk of celery and some pimento-stuffed olives. But something seemed to be missing. Hmm, what could it be? Well, unless the bacon had been blended up along with the other ingredients, it was the BACON that was missing in the BACON Bloody Mary! Bacon FAIL!\n\nWe mentioned this to our server when he brought our food and he was properly dumbfounded and apologetic--yet he never brought a slice of bacon to garnish the drink, nor did he offer us another Bloody Mary. Huh?\n\nHe redeemed himself, however, when he brought us a quarter of a fresh pineapple studded with fresh strawberries that we hadn't ordered. He explained that when he'd seen the pitiful 1/4 cup of barely-ripe cantaloupe the chef had put on the pass, he'd said he couldn't serve just that to us.\n\nI'd be willing to try Bacon again when I'm in town next, especially since they included a $5 off coupon with our check, but neither the food nor the service stood out on this visit."
4,"Terrific, authentically prepared Cajun food.\n\nWe stopped by the Phoenix Public Market yesterday to check out Food Truck Fridays.  It was almost 2 p.m. and they were getting ready to close so after quickly surveying the six trucks, we decided on Jamburritos.\n\nWe ordered the chicken and okra gumbo and the fried catfish special.  Both were awesome.  The gumbo was a fairly large portion that was rich, flavorful and chock full of sausage, chicken and okra.  Absolutely delicious and a steal at five bucks.  The catfish was completely non-greasy and cooked perfectly, served with rice and greens.\n\nHighly recommended."
0,Worst buffet I've ever been to. Overpriced and terrible quality. We ate dinner and it was so terrible I would not recommend this to someone I don't like. Also very small. The waiter took our food when we were not done. The staff was rude and seemed like they had other stuff to attend to. My advice eat at McDonald's. ......at least there not rude.
4,Yelp family you've done me right yet again. I had friends in from Texas and wanted to find a Mexican restaurant that was authentic!!  The restaurant is tucked on a corner of the strip mall and decor is cheesy. Painted scenes of the beach. The service and food are 5 star.  amazing and delicious.  Well done!!!!
0,They are the cheapest. It is not worth it. I stood in line for over 40 minutes when all of the other rental companies had no line at all. They only had 2 people at the counter and were having extremely long interactions with each customer trying to up sell. The line was long when I arrived and long when I left and many other customers were unhappy. Don't do it.
0,"The one at Alexis Nihon is really the worst. \nThe shelves are half empty, they wanted to put so many different departments that all of them are incomplete. Women's and men's clothes are disappointing. Nonetheless, I took 2 pieces to try on. At the changing rooms, the 2 teenagers were hidden behind a few piles of unfolded clothes and took a while before they saw me. They pointed the way to the room and it was a MESS ! The tiny hallway was cluttered with stuff and clothes and the room as well ! At least 15 pieces were hanging and on the floor with a bunch of broken hangers. I had no where to put the clothes so I just left without trying anything on. A man that seemed to be a manager there was yipping and yapping super loud all over the place and the shopping carts are just carelessly anywhere in the entrance blocking the access. Yes, customers leave them anywhere because that's what lazy people do but no one seemed to have picked them up since the start of the shift. Anyway... It's a free for all and Walmart looks high end compared to Target Alexis Nihon."
2,Pizza is fantastic. Service is marginal. Kid friendly interactive tables upstairs rarely work properly. \n\nKitchen is ridiculously slow but if you've got time and patience for a forgetful staff the za is worth the wait.
1,"This is a reliably clean chain restaurant, suitable for occasions when one doesn't feel like taking any risks and is willing to settle for mediocre food."
4,"Overview: Still consistent and awesome, despite some front of house turn-over. \n\nHits: Consistently updated (fresh) ingredients, incredibly informed service, and constantly reliable kitchen. \n\nMisses: Can have slow service...but it is a slow food restaurant so enjoy the time with the L'etoile crew and your dinner party.  \n\nHints: Order the C\u00f4te de B\u0153uf if it is available. I can easily share it with another person, but other friends devour the whole steak on their own. \n\nBottom line: It is a national icon in a mid-size city for a reason. Go."
2,"First time at Original Sunrise Cafe last week. I went with my husband and our friend who was in from out of town. \n\nWe were greeted and sat right away. Our server offered us drinks and gave us time to go over the menu. He was very nice and attentive throughout our dining experience. \n\nSince we were here for breakfast, I didn't spend too much time looking at the menu other than for breakfast foods. I did take a sneak peek at their sandwiches though, and they sound good. I would go back to try lunch. \n\nI'm a huge fan of pancakes, so I decided to get blueberry pancakes. They were good, but all the blueberriers were right in the center of the pancakes [in the batter, of course]. Not what I expected nor cared for. I'd prefer to have them spread out evenly. However, they were still appetizing.\n\nGood food at a decent price so I would go back."
3,"Always a classic place to stay and still definitely one of the more luxurious places to stay on the strip. The pools are definitely a place to be in the warmer months, but the crowd is not as young as you will see at the Hard Rock or the Cosmopolitan. The casino is first rate with restaurants that are solid (not amazing) as well. highly recommended."
0,"So, we went to Television City at MGM, and they gave us a coupon for a free appetizer at the Rainforest Cafe. Cool, right? I think: Great, my wife and I can split an appetizer and sandwich, escaping lunch for under $20. Great! Well, it was great. We were seated quickly. Our waiter was decent. The food was decent. Note that both were decent, not good. But, we pay, and I feel victorious. Lunch for under twenty bucks! Hooray! And then we got sick. The lunch from Rainforest Cafe cost us at least two days of our stay because we were stuck in our room, afraid to run too far from a bathroom. Skip over this restaurant. I'm a big fan of MGM... but they need to put in something better here."
0,The Pirate show was closed in December. Employees say it's indefinite...no plans to reopen at this time.
4,"I brought my daughters, aged 14 and 11 in here and the stylists were so nice and sweet to them. In my experience, alternative shops and stylists are not for kids, but the girls here were very good."
3,"I have eaten there several times during the day and early evening , the foods has always good , and the service has always be delightful, friendly and fast. I can't comment on the late night crowd but I can see it getting rather loud and, crowded and wild but thats a College thing , I assume it would have been a great place for me  years ago"
1,Decent food but incompetent staff with no comprehension of simple instructions or problem solving.
3,"Great coffee, music and environment. a nice alternative to lux."
0,"We had reservations to dine here before our Blue Man Group show last night.\nWe had high hopes because the concierge had recommended it as a great spot.  \nAfter being seated, we were \""greeted\"" by our waiter.  Maybe he was bored, maybe he had a bad day....maybe he is just is naturally rude.  He never smiled...he basically sneered the entire time.\nWe ordered calamari and the cheese and meat plate. The calamari was okay and the cheese was fine too....the meat was like huge piles of deli meat.  It looked completely unappetizing.  \nWe cut our losses and left after appetizers and wine.  Life is too short to spend more time with mediocre food and a rude waiter."
2,"Red Mansion is located in the new Grand hotel in Downtown, Las Vegas. It sits right next to the Stewart + Ogden restaurant. The restaurant is a bit small, but cozy. It's decor has a red and black Asian theme with really simple and modern lighting. \n\nMy coworkers and I went to Red Mansion for lunch on Chinese New Year. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special for $10.00. This lunch includes a lunch-size portion of Kung Pao, a side of rice and an egg roll. The chicken was tender, but I found it a but under seasoned. They were generous with the sauce on the dish, but the ratio of veggies vs. chicken left something to be desired. The white rice was fluffy and not dry. And, the egg roll I found to be a bit bland. All in all, the food wasn't memorable. \n\nI would say though, we were seated quickly and the service was good. Overall, good service experience, but I'm not sure I'd proactively seek this place out again.  Oh, and our meal didn't come with a fortune cookie:-("
4,"I love this place!  I first started going to Sherri over 2 years ago when she worked at Dylan's Salon, and I followed her when she opened up The Office.  Sherri helped me take the plunge in cutting my long curly hair into a pixie cut, and I haven't looked back since!  Sherri is incredibly talented in cutting short hair and ensuring that it maintains the edgy, yet feminine look that I'm going for.  I also love The Office's atmosphere...laid back, lots of sunlight, retro furniture, great art, and genuinely kind and hilarious people.  I would recommend The Office Salon to anyone!"
3,"I love the quality, of course, but the staff was as nice as the pens.  John helped me the first time I went in and helped me with a pencil.  When I went back to trade it in (the pencil just wasn't a fit), Paula helped me and she was great.  We talked dogs.  Very nice."
1,Not worth it and I would not recommend this place at all. Fish and chips are oily and batter is so crispy that it is falling of the fish. Fries are stale and burn looking. Chicken sandwiches are okay . Friends ate half on other half didn't feel like keeping. Waitress was friendly and great TVs
1,"I have been to this establishment in the past and have had a good experience. The burgers are great and the shakes are wonderful. It was just last night that I decided to take my family of four and two guests with us for dinner. The two additional guests were only ordering milkshakes and the family ordered dinner.\n\nThe reason for the star rating is not due to the food but what the server decided to do with the bill. You see there was six of us and they decided to include my 2 year old and my 10 month old as members of the party. They included the gratuity on the bill due to the size of the party. This disgusts me, they should not include a 10 month old as a member of the party. If they thought that they would be guaranteed some sort of tip good for them! I was able to save some money due to the tip being included and didn't feel bad for not tipping more after being a part of this greedy scenario.\n\nThis happened to us at another establishment and we have never returned!"
2,"Interesting to say the least!  Tourist trap at best.\n\nJust to be clear, the \""Roasted Jalapeno Poppers\"" did not appear to be roasted as the menu and name would suggest, they actually appeared to be fried.  6 jalapenos served in separate glasses, each half filled with a sauce were indeed tasty.  The promise of a hot surprise went unfulfilled - none of the poppers was anywhere close to being hot.  That's not to say the poppers weren't good, they just weren't \""as advertised.\""  GR should give me a call - I've got a killer roasted popper's recipe.\n\nThe burgers were good, tasty, but not worth the price.  The fries were typical steak fries, not bad, and again, way overpriced.\n\nSo, $85 later, (including the tip) my bride & I had two burgers, two drinks, a side of fries and an appetizer, which is a bit more than spendy for a burger joint, even a great burger joint.\n\nI'd be a fan of BurGR if it wasn't for being so overpriced.  As it is, it's okay.  I'll try some other places next time out."
4,WHAT A FANTASTIC FIND!!!!!\nPerfect sandwich after a long / late night of Vegas fun & drinking.  these are by far the most AMAZING sandwich's I have ever had.  It's at the Planet Hollywood which is one of my favorite places. I will keep this lil gem in the back of my mind the next time I hit up Vegas.
1,"I'm not a fan of this store. There was an outfit I was completely in love with for my newborn but for a onesie and pants it was 30 dollars. I'm not willing to spend that one an outfit my daughter will outgrow in a month. I went to Ross and found the exact same outfit for 7.99. Same with the toys, I paid 15.00 for a toy I later found at walmart for 5. I understand they have to make money  but wow the mark up is outrageous. The crib set selection is very very small. I was told to shop online which I'm not a fan of. Seeing as this store is based around babies you would think the crib set collection would be a little better."
1,"The house salad that came with my meal was ice cold. They give a new meaning to 'iceberg lettuce.' I mentioned it, and they replaced my salad with soup. The soup was good until I got into about my fourth spoon fool and noticed some aluminum foil. The main course was delicious, but who knows what the marinara sauce was covering up. If you ever order pizza while dining in... Do NOT ask for free bread and butter. You will be shut down rudely and looked down upon by some snobby waitress that says, \""That only comes with the main courses on the menu.\"" (I thought pizza was my main course that evening.)"
4,This is by far the BEST Chipotle location ever. I go here often. The staff are always friendly. They talk and carry conversations with me every time. This location is quick and clean. I could not ask for a better location!!!
0,"Ummm, we're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here. That was the last thing we had eaten for hours, and the next morning he DEFINITELY had eaten something bad after waking up... yikes."
3,"Friends and I came here as a backup for dinner on Saturday night - heard the burgers were good so we were pretty excited. \nI ordered the original \""mr personality\"" burger with no cheese, one friend the \""baba\"" one the \""jack Daniels burger\"" and one the wild shroom (veggie) burger. \nFirst let me say that the waiter was a beautiful man who was quite charming \nNext, the portions were HUMONGOUS   \nThe burgers were so big you could not fit your mouth around it. The fries were fresh cut and delicious. \nThe burger meat was to die for - definitely amazing. All my girlfriends liked their burger (although lots were left because it was so filling) but my veggie friend said her shroom burger was loose and fell apart and was too messy \nI do recommend this place but please go on an EMPTY stomach and don't try to eat politely haha \nAll in all yum but I felt like a beached whale coming home - hence 4 stars."
0,"Horrible. After hearing so much about Grimaldis and the lack of good pizza on the west side of the Las Vegas valley I thought I'd give it a try since I live less than 2 miles away. While ordering I asked for a side of pizza sauce and they asked if I wanted to come in to pick it up or if I wanted curbside pickup. I asked for curbside. They said 20-25 minutes. I left right away and arrived there 10 mins. after placing my order.  I parked in front and after 5 mins of waiting I decided to go inside. To my surprise it was already at the bar waiting. If it was ready why didn't they check to see if I was there to give me my pizza? And after sitting at the bar for who knows how long the pizza was cold. I got home 24 mins. after ordering my pizza. If I had waited the time they told me I would have picked up an even harder, colder pizza. The sauce was refrigerator cold which was annoying. The pizza was paper plate thin and although I ordered extra cheese it barely had any. I had to reheat the pizza when I got home but even so it was horrible. For $25 the largest pizza they had was so thin that all 8 pieces barely filled my wife and I. Metro pizza is much better and half a pizza fills us both. Will never go there again"
4,This place is amazing. I come here at least once a week. Amazing Italian food. The escargot is to die for. Family owned. Everyone is so friendly. Must try
1,Some good cigars. The selection of excellent cigars is limited. \n\n  The humidor is a little cold for storage. It's freezing. \n\n  We'll see what else is in Las Vegas.
4,"We were out shopping and a clerk at the store suggested this place.  Its an old Pizza Hut and our expectations were low bases on the exterior.  Delicious, fresh chinese food.  Friendly staff and amazingly clean!  Highly reccomend."
3,"Amazing. \n\nThe only reason why this place didn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't serve mainstream alcoholic beverages at the gaming tables!! I mean, I just wanted a beer. A Bud light and they didn't even serve that! Then I asked for a shot of Patron. \""No! Sorry!\"" Don Julio? \""Nope!\"" I don't know, seems kinda 'wrong\"" to me! \n\nOther than that, this is my new favorite spot in Vegas! Fun, upbeat and tons of stuff to look at! Being a local for more than 17 years, I'd say this spot is what Vegas needed! Food for every palette and shopping for all types of styles! I've eaten at just about every spot here. No complaints!\n\nLive music is a bit annoying at times. It was very distracting to listen to while sitting at the mini-baccarat table. I almost wanted to poke my eye out with the straw in my coffee. Besides the point, the staff was very nice and made me feel welcome. \n\nCan we talk about the vending machine upstairs? I could get false eyelashes out of this machine!! Make-up! Pantyhose!! Can I say one word? GENIUS! \n\nIf you aren't there for gambling, eating or drinking, definitely go for the people watching!! I could sit there all night! Beautiful people with more beautiful people and a lot of people who look like they got ready in the dark! The Cosmo is a great place to be!"
3,"I love this Best Buy in Henderson. The staff is very friendly and the managers are very helpful. The location is located very convienently next to costco, galleria mall and about a mile away from target and toys r us. Their price matching plan is pretty robust and they do match newegg and amazon. Since, amazon started charging taxes, this has been my go to place for electronics."
1,"2.5 stars. I'll round down rather than up as 3 is far too generous. \n\nThis is not Chinese. It's (only somewhat) Asian-esque.  Essentially the flavors are Asian, sort of, but it ends there. \n\nService is adequate if unpolished. \n\nL&lL fits right into the Phoenix area, certainly not known as a city for serious food devotees.  People seem to like this place. The food is decidedly unserious (but not in a good way); horribly sweet, poorly presented, much like \""Chinese\"" food one would find in any food court in middle America.  L&LL wouldn't last two weeks in any city with a clue but as this is Phoenix, well... \n\nNot recommended."
0,"went because the its supposed t be organic, but for me that was the worst burger ever, not a fan."
3,"If you find yourself in Vegas, AND you have a slight hang-over AND you're in a rush to fill your stomach with SOMETHING don't come here. Keep your vegas strip lovin butt away from this local gem.\nIf, however, you want the best eggs in Vegas served with the genuine diner service at the speed of light you've found your place."
3,"Enjoyed an excellent deep tissue massage here a few weeks back which was perfect to help relieve my stress. Gio was my masseuse and I mentioned that he should be tough on me since I was used to medical masages every week. He took that seriously and gave me a good massage/beating! LOL I was very happy with the amount of pressure he used on me. The subsequent time that you are able to spend in the spa lounging in their sauna or varying temperature whirlpools, one is cold, one is lukewarm and one is hot, is a great finishing touch after a great massage. \n\nExcellent spa, beautiful and clean with an attentive staff. And the prices were in line with what I was used to in New York."
1,"I have fond memories of coming here after school to indulge in the rare daytime meal that didn't taste vaguely of styrofoam. A few years and a few dozen burrito joints later, I've discovered this place kinda blows. \n\nI don't want to make any accusations, but if you told me the sour cream was cut with that \""sour topping\"" bullshit, I wouldn't be surprised. \n\nTheir guacamole is watery. \n\nTheir salsas are not spicy or flavorful. They don't add much to the meal. \n\nAt least they didn't screw up the carne asada. I love when it's got that grilled or skillet fried flavor, because it's kinda lame when it comes straight from just a pot. It's a small family-owned place that's got an expansive menu. There are only like 8 chairs inside. I'll try them again for old-times sake, but there's certainly not a rush."
1,"Just proving I'm not a foodie snob ;) well it's cheap, effective and comes with free packets of ketchup. Enjoy!"
3,"If you sample the dim sum with an experienced taster, china king with treat you well. Clams, bean curd roll, por stickers, ribs, battered fish ( the entire fish), and coconut rolls warm out of the oven. Try them all but don't fill up on any so you have room for a taste if them all."
0,"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n I'm a a local and I work in the restaurant industry as well, so I know how service works. I came after watching a movie with my family and since I've only been here once with my husband for a late night dinner, we enjoyed it. As soon as we come in the door the host just points his finger to the host at the end of the restaurant meaning \""go to her she will sit you\"" or so I think. We go and the hosts takes us to the booth . As we sat down he took our drink selections right away with a pretty emotionless face no smile no \""hello, how are we today\"", nothing. So we did take about 5 minutes to order since it is a rather big menu selection, so we let the server know we still needed a few. more minutes to decide. I guess the server Marlon decided to take quite a long time to come back to us since we ended up waiting about 10-15minutes. When he finally did, we ordered and he acted with a careless attitude and said \""OK\"" and left. OK, that's fine I guess. Then the food took quite a  long time, we were planning on leaving since the server was careless and everything seemed to be taking ages to come. But we didn't, we gave it another shot. My mother really didn't like the water soo much so she wanted a raspberry ice-t so when Marlon came walking by we asked him for one. Never came with one so we asked the young lady who refills the drinks to bring us one. She finally did with a smile as well.  Finally when the food came  at last, we eagerly ate with satisfaction that made me a litter happier. So then we don't find the server Marlon for about 20 minutes and my nephew and brother wanted ketchup and soy sauce ,we waited to see if he was ever going to show up again, he didn't,.. what a surprise. So I saw the manager and waved her down to see if SHE can bring the condiments to us she said \""Of course\"" with a smile. I thank her for that ! we finally ate in peace and Marlon came at the end of it all and we asked for boxes, he came quickly with those! And we got the check and went to go pay. Thinking that was the worst ever, I was wrong!! The cashier was the rudest. When I asked her politely if she can split the check, she said 'yeah\"" with a rude attitude. WHATEVER I thought!! Then as we signed the receipts I thought why tip, but MARLON was lucky to EVEN get a penny FROM ME,  but I gave him a dollar ANYWAYS because his quality of service was just that of a dollar. So as the cashier asked if we wanted our copies we said yes. And she gave me mine, then My mom didn't see her copy so she went back to her to ask for it POLITELY the rude ass lady slammed her hand on the copy and said \""HERE\"". I'm sorry but if you don't have time to have a smile and manners to be in the service industry no matter how old you are you should QUIT and go elsewhere. I put up with the rudest people at my job but yet I have respect for anyone who has the decency to smile and act polite!! My family and I didn't deserve such shitty service, no one does! THANKS for nothing!"
4,We bought one of the 9 stage systems and love that it balances the PH of the RO water. The prices are the best we could find for high quality equipment. It's also nice that it's made in the U.S. instead of China.
2,"Had my first twin peaks experience last weekend. Here's my review:\n1. \""Scenic Views\"" - Excellent!  The girls are hot and also personable (at least our waitress was personable).  I joked with my friends that they must recruit at eating disorder clinics as the only chunky girls or girls with any fat or cellulite in the place were customers. The waitresses here stop to chit chat with their customers not just drop off food and drinks and run.  \n\n2.  Sports watching: Good.  Lots of TVs ring the bar. we were there to watch Sunday NFL games and all 5 of us have different favorite teams and we were all able to see a TV from our table that had our respective games on them.  Of course you're only getting sound from the big draw game going on but that's everywhere.\n\n3.  Food:  Average/Fair: Nothing memorable, and not a very big selection of food offerings.  The waitresses, who BTW are very good promoters & up-sellers of their food and products, definitely make the limited menu items sound better than they actually were. Not that the food was disappointing or bad, it was just a little over exaggerated/oversold. I and a couple others had hangover burgers which is an average burger with a fried egg on it,  Burgers comes with fries which are the thick steak fry kind and they are seasoned. For the price it would've been nice if it had a couple more topping options were offered with the burger, but how it came out was adequate. My friend had the Philly cheese steak which I had part of.  Now a disclaimer: I'm from Philly originally so rarely do I give a cheese steak outside of the Philly/NJ?NY area a positive review because so often they are missing one or more important parts of what makes a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Twin Peak's version was no exception...I'd call it a decent cheese steak but not a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Another friend had the pork nachos which were good. We had to send something back to the kitchen (not me) due to temperature not being warm enough, but that was quickly rectified  \n\n4. Beer: Good! Had their Hefeweizen which was cold and tasty. \n\nOnly negative was when the bill for me and my girlfriend's portion came, the waitress had my GF down for 3 big beers instead of the 2 beers she actually ordered. When I brought this to the waitress' attention, she first tried to convince me that she was almost 100% positive my GF had ordered that many beers, however my GF is tiny and she would've been on the floor if she had that many beers in that short amount of time.  Finally the waitress had her manager remove the unordered beer from the bill, but was kind of surprised the waitress argued with us initially.  \n\nSo I'd go back for the beers, game watching & scenic views.  I'll probably eat elsewhere though before I go."
3,"Definitely the best coffee shop in the Champaign-Urbana area. The prices are reasonable, the music (at times) is decent, and the baristas for the most part are friendly. On top of this, they have consistent closing hours at midnight. The reason for four stars is that it can occasionally be a hit or miss on the quality of the prepared drink. Also, the sandwich sizes are tiny given their price."
2,"A small and cozy coffee shop. The service is quick, and the shop (including the milk/sugar counter) is clean."
1,Last two visits bartenders not as friendly as first time
1,Way back  Pure used to be cool. Or maybe I just didn't know any better. The layout is really horrible. If u are not doing vip dont expect to be able to dance or \neven move. Don't waste your time with the long lines..really NOT worth it.
1,"I had high hopes for The Habit burger so I am disappointed that I did not enjoy it much. The flavors of the burger were just okay and for the price I would have thought my burger would have been a little bigger. I do enjoy the condiment station that offers you jalapenos, pepperoncinis, etc. However, for the price and quality In-N-Out is just down the street and, in my humble opinion, better."
3,"First let's start by saying I'm a Monta fan.\nI came here seeing it was a new ramen joint, it's definitely spacious inside with a nice ambience. The staff and service was great. The bathroom was clean although they do not have paper towels as an option only air dryer. We got here around 8 and only 1/3 of the restaurant was filled. \n\nI ordered a Tokyo tonkotsu ramen combination with their crispy chicken (3 pieces) and side salad while my girlfriend got a Tokyo tonkotsu ramen as well, both with thin noodles. I added corn for $1 while my girlfriend added chicken dumplings (2 pieces) $2. The side salad was mediocre, if I'd known I woulda just skipped the combination and just got a 5 piece crispy chicken for an extra $1. The crispy chicken was better than most places that I've tried. Now if you think Monta's tonkotsu ramen is salty then this place's broth might be for you as it is not as heavy/thick as Monta's. The chashu was more lean not much flavor, I like a fatty chashu like Monta's. There were not many options on adding your own spice, however the fresh garlic was a nice touch. The thin noodles were different from Monta's but still good.\n\nOver all this has got to be my second favorite ramen place in Vegas, I will probably come back and try a different type of ramen, maybe their spicy chicken."
1,"Sign up for a Yoga Nirvana yoga retreat to Hawaii if you want to stay hidden in the middle of the woods-- a 40 minute drive each way to the beach, in grimy unsanitary cabins that remind you of sleep-away camp in Flagstaff when you were 15, with a Yoga instructor that downplays you with every inquisitive question, who has no plan of action nor willingness to claim responsibility of set expectations with a price tag of $1299.  Not only did Jim Keegan (owner of Yoga Nirvana & retreat leader) not live up to the expectations set prior to the retreat-  (2 meals cooked by private chef & 2 yoga classes a day) -but when a question was proposed due to lack of planning & communication his response was one which became defensive & condescending with passive aggressive behavior using tactics of intimidation. YIKES (red flag #1)\n\nBut what really did it for me was the conversation over our first dinner where Jim proceeded to express his disapproval of the horrific traditional female genital mutilation practices by the Afgan people saying they \""should be extinguished as a culture of people.\""  WHOA --- Yes female genital mutilation is evil but so is genocide! I was in complete shock! I mean isn't my Yoga instructor teaching consciousness awareness, compassion, patience & positivity? For the sake of love & revelations,  weren't we here on a retreat? Meanwhile at the dinner table it was genocide. COMPLETE YIKES! (red flag #2)  p.s. female genital mutilation isn't even a practice in Afghanistan.\n\nSuddenly my yoga instructor, who I claimed as a teacher of 8+ years became a complete stranger.  That night I decided to myself that I'd be leaving the group & that there was no way I would be able to surround myself with this type of energy off of the Yoga mat, let alone spend the next 6 days in Hawaii a 40 minute drive from the sun rising & setting over the ocean, in the middle of a forest.\n\nGoing with the flow until the right timing presented itself, I left on my own journey the second morning after witnessing Jim as he simply watched, from behind these pavilions where we were having a.m. yoga practice, 3 of his students who were lost due to lack of communication. After some time had passed my conscious forced me to get up from my mat & walk out from behind our location, signaling to the students --where they even started there own practice. Not only did Jim not welcome these students to the practice, but Jim had the audacity to question me as I walked by him,  \""are you or aren't you practicing?\""  I GASPED!!\n\nThe real question here is, \""Jim, are YOU or aren't YOU practicing?\"" \n\nLike I said, Ive been a student of Jim's for over 8 years, from way before the beginning days of Yoga Nirvana studios & am in complete shock that meeting him out of the classroom was like meeting a complete stranger...a stranger whose embodiment is the complete opposite of his own teachings.  Ive asked Jim to refund only $200 of the $1299 cost to cover my dinning expenses & other yoga instruction of which I attended at a local island studio & his response was \""why should I... you are leaving voluntarily?\"" followed by a simple \""NO.\"" After some serious reflecting, for over a week now  --  I have come to the conclusion that Jim Keegan has been teaching what he MOST needs to learn & practice himself. Any PHD would call this projection.  This person does not in any way, shape or form embody his own teachings off of the mat & out of the classroom. \n\nThis is a true case of :: 'PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH' \n\nCan I get a witness? Yes I can -- because 2 other students (full names upon request) also decided to separate from the group, who joined me due to the negative energy, nasty attitude & total confusion/ chaos that started upon arrival to the island & our first destination 'COSTCO!!!'  \n\nMy heart goes out for you Jim & while experiencing the practices of my life in Hawaii lead by both Kali Ray Torres & Psalm Issadora, Ive humbled myself to you, committing myself to a prayer for you every time I step on my mat.  Your time will come....will it be karma, fate or destiny? \n\nNAMASTE"
4,"I have to give Vivace 5 stars for a number of reasons: \n\n1. Service is outstanding. Go here and you will be treated the way I wish EVERY restaurant in the world treated their customers-friendly and respectful staff, no snobbery either. \n\n2. The food. Here are just a few of my favorites: \n\nMussels: If you are a mussel fan, get these. A large portion of mussels (none of this 10 dinky mussels in a dinky cereal bowl type of thing). The broth is excellent. Want extra bread for dipping (recommended)...no problem! \n\nCured Meat and Cheese board: You can select a variety of cheeses and meats for a yummy appetizer. The staff has never steered me wrong when asking for a recommendation. \n\nWarm Bittersweet Chocolate Cake: I have come to Vivace solely for this dessert (after eating dinner elsewhere!). Be difficult like me, and ask for plain vanilla gelato, if they have it, in purist fashion. \n\nI have tried a variety of their entrees, the salmon and duck particularly stand out. Oh- and their brunch options are delish, and will cure even the sickliest of hangovers, with class of course. Portions are very nicely sized. The atmosphere is lively, modern, but still relaxed and un-stuffy. Please go to Vivace, it will not be your last visit."
1,Just a little dive bar!  This is a spot that we used to head to for a few beers at the end of the night when I lived in the neighborhood.  There are a bunch of Native American's that frequent this establishment.\n\nThe best thing about Playa Bar is they will package up a few brews for you to take home with you.\n\nNot much to say about this old little hole in the wall.
3,"Great food that is well priced. Come here twice a week. Lunch on Mondays and Dinner on Wednesdays. tried most of the menu with no complaints. Great happy hour prices, though the portion size is really small. Only complaint would be the wait during the lunch hour and slow service all around. Been to 3 of their locations in the valley and all have the same quality food and service. \n\nOverall, great food at reasonable price."
1,"the food is comparable to the Charleston location.  it's ok.  the ambiance is pretty lame.  finally, I realize they just opened but their staff is laughably untrained.  fixable problems but I don't think service and d\u00e9cor are priorities for lola."
1,"If you want bad service & ok sushi, then this is your place.Don't be fooled by the yelp sticker on the front door! We arrived at 1:15 pm.  We needed service for 3 adults & 1 child.  We had to wait for a table, no problem. There is no waiting area. We stood there, blocking the door with our 2 infant car seats, toddler, & 3 adults.  Who's gonna wait outside in the 100deg heat?!   We finally sat down at 1:50, the tables had been clear for a good 10 mins before they finally sat us.   Another 15 mins to tell them we wanted AYCE, we were able to order some food.  \nCons: SLOW AND INCONSIDERATE STAFF.  They need more help, 2 servers & a busser were clearly not enough for the busy lunch hour.  I heard the busboy tell the server we were ready, he simply said ok, I'll be there.  Then 10 more mins passed by.  Not that he wasn't busy, but he was too busy doing other things then to come & take our order.  Then he & the other server had to discuss which one was taking our table.\n-The red bean ice cream they served was old-tasting & old-looking.  My friend asked if she could get another since it was so ice cold, her spoon was about to become disfigured as she tried to eat it, but the server said that was how it came, \""hard as a brick, sorry\"".  \n-We had to flag them down for everything...\nPros:\n-the AYCE menu included hot/cold appetizers as well.  I thought that was a good deal. \n\nBe back? Probably not, since there are at least 3 more sushi restaurants within a 5 mile radius competing for my business."
3,"Great food, one of the best green curry dishes I have ever had. The pad thai could be a little better but that's just being but picky."
2,"We wound up here for dinner because we had coupons for 2-for-1 mai tais, and a coupon for a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree.   The service couldn't have been nicer or more attentive, and he was tipped for this excellent service accordingly.\n\nHowever, I found the food to be lacking.  The chicken in the red thai curry was tough and overcooked, and the sauce oily and uneven.  The calamari appetizer was much better.  Mai tais were marvelous.  \n\nMy advice? Come here for drinks and appetizers before a show, but eat your real dinner elsewhere."
2,"I was on the fence with Frank and Fina's as to whether I'd give three or four stars. I went with three mainly because I was disappointed in the main dish.\nI came here specifically to try the Cochinita Pibil. It's a slow-roasted pork dish. Supposedly it's wrapped in banana leaves. It didn't taste that much different from regular roasted pork. IT didn't taste like the flavors were slowly cooked in.\nOverall, it's a nice restaurant. They have good chips and salsa. And they give you an option to get pinto beans or black beans as refried beans. It didn't seem like a special restaurant, though."
1,"My husband and I ate here last weekend (Aug 2014). The atmosphere is nice and old-style homey, similar to other restaurants in Madison. \n\n-Best things- Porchetta was melty, tender and delicious. Also, the waitress put a bottle of water on our table so we could refill our own glasses. The poutine was also very tasty. \n\n-Worst things- DO NOT order the ravioli. This was one of the worst dishes we have ever ordered. It was essentially a raw egg wrapped in pasta with some cheese on top. Yuck. Also, one of our dishes was served to another table. When the other table notified the waiter, he lazily just moved the dish to our table. I wish the kitchen had remade the dish for us since it had been served to someone else, even though they did not eat it. A restaurant of this caliber should have better policies on this. \n\nThe food at this restaurant was mostly enjoyable, but this is not a place I would like to eat at regularly. The food is just too rich, dense and calorie-laden. I left feeling like a heavy blob. There were very few healthy or light items on the menu. I feel like the menu needs to be rebalanced. I doubt we will go back here."
0,I went for a nice meal tonight and wound up with a rather bad experience. I first sat in the bar and got a drink. After watching the bartender cater to a group of five while I sat alone and waited 10 minutes for a menu I decided to sit somewhere else in the main dining room.  Kevin then served me. Everything was fine until a party of eight showed up and then he could care less about me and did not show up but once every 20 minutes. Of course when he did come by he wanted to know if I wanted another $20 glass of wine to pump up the bill.  Stay away from this place because the servers just want to make their money on the big parties. And my tip to Kevin showed it. I have been known to tip a lot. Usually 50%. But not tonight and I will not go back. Typical West Coast environment. Short term
2,"This was my 3rd time here, so I knew what to expect.  there were 3 of us women & we went for lunch on a Wed.  We were seated immediately & given menus & water.  But no drink order was taken.  When our waiter arrived - same thing - he brought bread & pesto - after being asked.  But didn't ask for a drink order.  Brought out the bread - still no order.  Came back out & took our food order, but...you get the idea.  We shared the 3-bruchetta combo which was fresh & tasty.  I had the chopped chicken salad which was just OK.  Too much dressing on it which overpowered the tender chicken & the yummy, crunchy peanut granola on top.  The table was cleared & cleaned but we were never offered dessert or cookies, pastries, gelato, etc.  Our waiter kindly split our tab 3 ways...which would have been much bigger...had he ever offered us drinks or dessert.  Decent food but if I want average, offhand serivce, I can stay in Chandler & go to Chili's and spent a lot less $$$."
4,"A recent road trip to Montreal took us here - close to McGill, in the plateau/Mont Royal neighbourhood, Cafe Cherrier is a lovely place to dine!\n\nThe service was amazing, all staff appeared to be bilingual, there is a beautiful patio, and the decor inside is very \""I'm in paris\"".  The crowd is a little older, a little more sophisticated - it's definitely not full of boisterous young drinkers - but it's plenty lively, full of that charming Montreal upscale hustle and bustle. \n\nWith a great wine list, and 4 or 5 beer options (as well as cocktails), this was the perfect place to grab a late afternoon snack and beverage. Also at our table was the cheese plate, and the frits. As cliche as it sounds,try the FRENCH fries, they're beyond delicious. Between that and my Stella, I was in heaven. (There is also a full dining menu, reasonably priced)\n\nCafe Cherrier was a delight to dine at. Great service, charming atmosphere, delicious food, and blocks away from other restaurants, shopping, and anything else you might be looking for. I think you may even be able to see Heidi & Seal's house across the park..."
4,Great yogurt! Everyone was very nice. Great flavors & great names. We got a punch card and will fill it up fast!
3,"Fast, delicious food. Friendly staff, this is a great place to grab lunch for a small price."
3,"I see Dr. Ackerman so my review will be based on her.  There is another Doctor in the office however, Dr. Kessler.  Dr. Ackerman is the primary doctor I believe.  \n\nTHE DOCTOR\nDr. Ackerman is very young- I'd guess around 30, so I believe the practice is pretty new.  She got her MD in 2007, according to the big fancy diploma on her wall (and from Tulane, for all you private school snobs out there... don't worry, I'm included).  She's nice, professional, but not super warm.  She comes off very businesslike and sort of agressive about treatment so if that turns you off and you want more chit chat and a little more smiling, she probably won't be for you. She's friendly though, so don't get me wrong.  Just not a kindergarten teacher type.   I liked that she didn't waste my time and listened closely to what I had to say and responded with exactly the treatment I had hoped she would.   Also, I mentioned as an aside that I was a runner and she remembered that when prescribing sun-sensitive medication, without having to ask.  Good attention to detail.  \n\nTHE SERVICE\nSuper efficient and friendly.  The have a very large staff and a large patient volume if the number of people in the waiting room says anything.  They manage it seamlessly, however.  The receptionist was very polite even though I was a flake and managed to be late and forget my insurance card.  She didn't scold and helped me figure it out and got me in and out quickly anyway.  Also, I booked an appointment for a couple of different issues and they resolved them both right away and didn't make me come back a second time and pay more office fees etc.  \n\nTHE PRICE\nI have insurance so I have no idea.  However, I included this to note that she put me on a very expensive medication without warning me.  It didn't affect me because I had perscription insurance so I guess that's probably why she didn't say anything.  I would have liked to know though, because my insurance will be changing soon and it may affect me then. \n\nTHE OFFICE\nFor those who care about these things with doctors' offices (and I do- if I'm going to be stuck waiting and made uncomfortable, I'd like it to be as pleasant as possible)....    Clean, nicely decorated, newly remodled, new everything.  Comfortable exam rooms that are kept very tidy and hygenic.  Believe it or not, I can't say that about all doctors I've been to in the valley."
0,"I would not recommend doing business with this company.  They follow unethical business practices of accepting reservations and then doubling or tripling them right before your reservation time. I made a reservation and received a confirmed rate of $60/hour.  Two weeks later they called and told me the rate has increased to $205.  The manager was unrepentant, difficult and unapologetic.  Do the world a favor and give your business to companies that offer ethical and upstanding service."
3,Great studio! This was the first time I was excited to go for an exercise class. It's a bit pricey but worth it! Unfortunately I moved from that neighborhood so discontinued but will definitely look at joining again in the future!\nThey have some great instructors and its not intimidating for anyone new to hot yoga! Only drawback is the selection if classes on weekday evenings- or at least it was for me as a newbie.
2,"Is there a way to insult the great culture and food of Mexico any more than just the existence of Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, and Del Taco already have? Why yes, there is. The chocolate nachos at El Pollo Loco. And yet, I have given it 3 stars, because it is marshmallow and chocolate syrup and served to me in my car and I am weak. I understand that I deserve your judgment, but try to forgive me. It's marshmallow sauce in the car for under $3.00."
4,"This review is for the service department. After the horrible experience at Autonation Toyota back in February, I was not really looking forward to taking my new honda to a dealer to get it serviced. But I went here anyway, having heard good things about findlay. So I went, and they changed my oil, rotated my tires, inspected my car, and washed my car for free all within 30 minutes! This was on a really busy day too. They also provide free Starbucks coffee and free soda as well. And I guess they had a meeting or something and they had left over cake, so they offered my bestie and I a piece of cake. Once we finished our cake our service advisor found us in the showroom and told us that my car was all washed and ready to go. So I paid and went on with my day. This place is great, and when I'm in the market for another car, which will be a Honda, I will be buying it from here without a doubt."
3,"The food is good, though the burgers are a *tad* on the greasy side. I get a kid's meal and it fills me up perfectly. Staff is always nice, even when there's a rush, but there's no place to stand and wait for a take out order aside from next to the soda fountain and trash."
3,"Came here after reading the other good reviews on Yelp, and I wasn't disappointed - they're all true (including this one!).\n\nWhen I showed up, it's obvious that this place has been around for a long time. Like a lot of the other good poutine places in Montreal, don't be food by the fact that the decore hasn't been changed in 20 years - you're not here for the ambiance.\n\nI got the cheese burger and poutine. The burger was a good North American burger - a bit small by Aussie standards, but the toppings were all fresh. In the end, it was just a side to the \""main\"" dish... The poutine was fantastic! the fries were good, fresh, but not too fried. The gravy was outstanding. It was thicker than most poutine gravies, very beefy. The cheese curds were fresh, and there were plenty of both on it. \n\nIf that seems like a lot of time to spend describing fries, curds, and gravy, then you don't know how big a deal poutine is in Montreal. I won't say it's the best in Montreal here, but if you're serious about trying the \""best of\"" poutines, you HAVE to try A.A.'s."
4,I parked my new car too close to a pine tree and it got sap spattered all over it! Mario came to my house and got the whole car clean for a very reasonable price...far less than I was quoted else where. Thank you MAD!
1,"I stopped by for the first time on Wednesday morning at about 9:30 . I ordered their special, two sausage biscuits and a cup of coffee. I also ordered two country ham biscuits to go, (for my wife at home). The coffe was good and that's about it.\nThe sausage was paper thin and could have been used as shoe leather. The biscuits were heavy and very chewy.\nMy wife did say that the country ham tasted OK alone. Her biscuits were the same as mine.\nTo add, I asked the cashier/biscuit maker if the biscuits were fresh and she said that she made them from scratch herself. \nVERY DISAPPOINTED !"
2,"I came her with a larger group, and the waiter (also one of the bartenders) mixed up the orders of two people who ordered filet mignon. The girl who ordered hers medium well started eating the one that was medium rare, cutting around the \""undercooked\"" part, so the guy who got the dry-as-a-bone meat had to wait for another to be cooked off. It was unfortunate, but they corrected the mistake and offered free beignets to our entire party.\n\nThe cheese board was kind of pathetic. I had the jambalaya, which was pretty decent. The curds are just okay. I've been spoiled by The Old Fashioned. I got the creme brulee for dessert, and the crunchy burnt part on top was awesome, but overall it was just way too large and half of it ended up going to waste.\n\nThey have tons of vegetarian options, and the jambalaya with seitan looks so good. Next time I go back, I'll have to try out their dishes with seitan! It was an overall positive dining experience and I'd give it another shot."
1,"Just one word, disappointing ,,, The sushi appetizers were average; the entrees, while good, where nothing spectacular, and the service left much to be desired. I can accept the mediocre food; but the service was down right weird for a high-end restaurant. I arrived late, after the other 5 in my party had been seated. I ordered a Dirty Vodka Martini ... after 10 minutes the waiter returned to ask me if I wanted that \""neat\"" ... duh dude. 10 minutes after that our pre-dinner drinks arrived. My second pre-dinner drink arrived after we were served dinner. I had also ordered a bottle of wine for the table. That arrived 5 minutes after our meals as well- there was simply no sense of continuity in the meal.\n\nIf this was Denny's ... I can understand the slip-shot service; but at $30 a plate, I at least expect to have my wine served with my meal."
0,"This place serves some sort of food but it is not Mexican.   Please, please avoid the grease bomb served here.    If you must go across the street to the In n out burger joint.  \n\nNassssttyyyy."
3,This is the first place I ever tried Pho and I am now almost a weekly guest for the last year or so.  Their fried and fresh rolls are delicious and always full of flavor as well as their dipping sauces. The french bread is a buck and tasty.  The plate of bean sprouts and seasonings are always fresh.  If I'm ever feeling under the weather a big bowl of #22 definitely makes me feel better.   Best Iced Tea in Las Vegas. The service is extremely fast and fairly friendly.  Just wish they had a bigger space as there is sometimes a decent wait at peak hours.  Tried a few other Pho places in town and this is definitely the best around.
2,Excellent service!!! Great food presentation had the grilled salmon with apple cinnamon I believe (I'll post a picture of it). Its just kind of expensive. IT JUST SUCKS THEY DONT HAVE PICK UP ALL I WANTED WAS TO COME BACK AT A DIFFRENT TIME AND GET A PIECE OF CAKE. But the nice waitress told me I'd have to come in sit down a be served and order food as well. She said I could come in and just get my cake first and then tell them that I don't want food after I get it in a container but my server wouldn't be too happy. So.... that's the only thing I didn't appreciate.
4,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! The best cirque show I have seen!\nOut of all the cirque shows offered in Vegas, this one is the most expensive one- even the cheapest is around $100. But it is worth every penny!\nIt doesn't matter where you sit because every seating is great.\nI actually enjoy sitting in the higher sections because you can see the entire picture.\nThere is no real storyline but it is very entertaining."
4,"We stayed at the Hotel San Carlos this past Memorial Day weekend during the Phoenix Comicon and not only is the hotel beautiful and rich with history but the staff is AMAZING! \n\nThere were 5 of us checking in and we had a small room that was going to be tight but we were going to make it work when the girl behind the counter let us know that the suite was available and it had more room. She offered us a good deal compared to their normal pricing but we were all a little tight on funds so we were nervous about upgrading. She asked the manager to come over and after chatting with all of us for a few minutes (she was so super sweet and informative about the history of the hotel and an absolute pleasure to speak with) she worked some kind of wonderful magic and brought the room down to a killer deal that was completely mind blowing. All of us were so excited because not only did each of us now have a bed to sleep in, but it was going to save us money so that we had a bit more to spend at the Con. \n\nThe room had a separate living room with a couch bed, desk, chair, and foot stool. The bedroom had 2 full-size beds and a nice desk. The view was of downtown PHX and it had 2 nice-sized closets and 2 bathrooms! This was perfect for 3 girls and 2 guys since we all had to get ready at the same time. \n\nThe hotel is beautiful. The lobby is quaint and well appointed. Obviously being a historical landmark it is older and smaller than the gigantic contemporary resorts that many of us are now used to, but it's so much better in many ways. It was warm and friendly and felt like a loved one's home. Honestly I would stay there again anytime. \n\nThere is talk about it being haunted but I didn't get a scary vibe from the hotel at all. I will say that without knowing anything about the haunting history I did step onto the elevator by myself to go up to my room and all of the sudden I smelled some sort of fruity  perfume smell that was not present when I first got into it and the elevator which was set to go up took me down to the basement even though the B button was not pushed and my room was on the 5th floor. The doors opened revealing the basement and I said \""Hello?\"" There was no one around. It kind of creeped me out a little bit later when I found out more about the history of the hotel and it's haunting stories. \n\nI highly recommend the Hotel San Carlos for those of you who appreciate history and don't mind a hotel with character. \n\nOh and the parking isn't awful. It's just a little jot up the street which for those of you who don't mind walking a short ways, is just fine. If you do mind walking, they have valet."
4,"If you're looking for a place to spend some time with your family doing good works and raising money for a good cause, this is the place. Individuals, families and groups are welcome. You can sign up online at www.fmsc.org. You get to wear a hairnet and pack food that goes to starving kids around the world. Can't wait to go again!"
1,"At this El Pollo Loco they charge more for some items than any other El Pollo Loco I have been to. What happened to me is I simply asked for black beans instead of the pinto beans in a burrito and was told they might charge more. The manager came out and rudely said it would be .49 more. This is even after I mentioned that the 3 other El Pollo Loco's I go to do not charge more. I wasn't asking for a side dish, just a simple substitute. Wow, customer service is bad and I should have gone to any one of the other places around there."
4,This place is great! Clean and friendly! Toby and Adam helped me out a lot and I feel they even went out of their way for me a few times on some things I needed!\nI have already told several of my friends and co-workers to go here for their upgrades over other sprint store.\nDefinitely top notch service!
2,Kalbi Ribs was good and the Garlic Chicken was ok. They give you two very small scoops of rice so I had to order a extra scoop. The macaroni salad had no taste and would suggest putting a little salt and pepper to make it eatable!
1,"(+)\n- cheap\n\n(-)\n- 50 dollar cab ride from the airport :(\n- old everything\n\n\nI thought hotels on the strip were lighted poorly, this one was probably the worst. Most likely due to the fact that it is so old and looks like it hasn't been remodeled/updated in forever. Our room looked very old and the bathroom especially looked extremely outdated. Beds weren't that comfortable. \n\nThe only saving grace of this hotel was that we only paid about 40 bucks each between 5 people (2 queen beds) for 3-4 nights. There's no reason to stay here unless you're really tight on money, want to explore old las vegas, or want to be closer to the LV speedway."
2,This place was recommend think I expected better. I had the ahi tuna tacos and it was cold. Very bland tasting. The salsa really didn't have any flavor to it and margarita I've had better
3,"I usually don't review fast food but I have to say I have never really been disappointed here. They have gluten free options which is a huge wow factor for fast food.\n\nMy food is always tasty. Not a fan of the flame roasted corn but thats personal preference. \n\nStaff is typical fast food staff. Unfriendly, short fused teenagers but hey what ya gonna do, ya don't go there for the service."
3,"Came in for lunch. Got seabass with asparagus and potatoes, and an appetizer of mussels. I was quite satisfied. I didn't think it cost too much money for what I was getting (\u00a310, but I'm American, so I don't really know what to epect). Ale selection wasn't bad either."
2,"From all I've seen on television lately about the culinary boom in Vegas I expected more from David Burke.  First, I'll say that there were only two waiters working but that's not odd considering that only 4 tables were occupied.  We should have taken that as a sign to move on and maybe go to Cut which was just a little bit further.  (Those two waiters were great though - very friendly and amusing.)\n\nThe food was just ok.  Not spectacular as I had hoped.  I started with the spinach salad which was good - but again nothing special.  I then had the dumplings.  They were pretty bad.  The dough was so tough and I didn't realize the thing poking out of the top was a stick so I bit down on it pretty hard.  I also had the Scallops Benedict appetizer - it was so bland.  I really, really love scallops and I love \""Benedict\"" anything so I was hoping for something truly wonderful.  I didn't get any flavor of the lobster foam and the bread part that the scallop was sitting on had a weird texture.\n\nMy favorite part of my dining experience was my cocktail - the Moonlander.  Champagne, Triple Sec, Peach liqueur and Tang!  It was so good that I had two!  \n\nThe last thing I'll say is that I was sitting on this red bench against the fountain.  I'm not sure how old this restaurant is but the bench was hardened from the water spray from the fountain.  It was also discolored and I couldn't help but feel that my behind was wet the entire time I was there.  Surely someone has noticed this and I can't understand why it hasn't been fixed.  I most likely would not go back to this place if I were in Vegas again."
1,I understand retail sucks but it retail. Do not give my wife and I attuitde because you are tired. Do work retail then.
0,We should have read the reviews first!!  We ordered online for a 5:30 delivery... Our food was delivered at 4:30.  If we had wanted it at 4:30 we would have said so.  The food was tasteless and soggy.  We will never go back.  There are too many good restaurants out there.
0,"Found a house to rent. Went down to realty office to fill out application and it was a wasted trip.  I walked into the office and 3 people saw me at the counter and no one welcomed me to the office. I had to ask for assistance. Already with a bad taste in my mouth, the front desk man was dressed unprofessional and lacked any information in regards to renting a property.  He insisted that  i sign my application and turn it in without the blanks $ amounts filled in. I refuse to sign an application without knowing all the fees involved.  I asked numerous times to have a sit down with someone in the office to answer all my questions and i was told no. I would have to call the realtor on the phone for any answers.  I am very unhappy with the customer service this business offers to their potential clients and i will not refer any one to this place."
0,"Very friendly Owner/Operator, but the absolute WORST extensions I have ever had. I called and left a voicemail that within one day about half of the lashes were falling out. Never a return phone call, email, anything. Just dead silence. The lashes that were left were clumped and crooked. I was told they were Mink, but I know they were cheap, awful plastic. I had to have the remainder professionally removed, and a new set on with a new person at a new salon. Again, the owner was personal and funny, but she really does not know what she is doing as far as extension application. Stick with a professional whom has been certified, like Lavish. A total waste of time and money. I have been to about five different salons over the past five years, and never had an experience like this, or this awful. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID."
2,"Great place to stay.  Only thing I didn't like about it was the location.  Other than that I would give it 4 stars.  The rooms are very nice, clean and smell really good.  The area is going to get better now that the New SLS Hotel and Casino is opening up right down the street.  I can't wait to test that place."
1,"The overall experience was great, the artist was personable and relaxed. Decent pricing, shop minimum is based on the work which I completely agree with. My only concern is with the healing, took care of the tattoo like the said. However, it began to fade after it healed and my once all black tattoo now looks like it has been shaded instead. Although their staff is great as well as the artwork the actually tattooing, wasn't the best quality. I think it was more of the artist not the shop."
0,"The renovations are out of control, and there was not a warning of this when I booked my room online, nor did they discount my room because of that (partially my own fault for not researching, but they should have helped me out!)\n\nLike most of the recent reviews, I agree that it is a complete maze to find anything. There are not many signs or instructions to help you out either. We couldn't find the correct elevator for the restaurants. We had to go down some random, non-functioning escalators and got lost trying to find the casino. When we checked in she told us how to get to our room:  go down this hallway, you'll see elevators, take them up to the second floor, turn left and go to the end and go back down to the first floor. HAHA WHAT? But we found it.\n\nFirst thing we said upon opening our room door was OHHH NOOO, smelled like mold and urine. Carpet was gross. Beds looked decent and were comfortable. Did not see any bugs or DNA but the smell hurt. The main light did not work and the decor was old and dirty.\n\nThe location is good.\n\nEven if these renovations are completed spectacularly I will not return."
0,"Second visit here. The chips and salsa are very good. I filled up on them and they kept them and the salsa coming. Can't go wrong with the appetizer combo plate. I got it the first time I came here,  and got it again. It's big enough to fill you up. The food is yummy. \n\nMy problem is with the music. Music should be subtle and ambient. I get that they are sticking to the Mexican theme with their music. But enough already do I really need to be rattled out of my seat by tubas, and squeeze box Oompa-Loompa bands? \n\nTurn the volume down let the music be in the back ground.  It's a restaurant, not a night club. I couldn't eat all my food the music was that loud and that bad, it turned my appetite.  I seriously wanted to walk outside and throw my body under a passing bus. \n\nNext time I'll order and eat it out on the curb on Dysart road, you can hear it from there but it's not blaring and you don't have to yell at your dinner date to be heard. \n\nOompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da!"
1,Ok food is pretty good. So why the two stars. $30 for 2 adults and a kid. Service is horrible. The place smells like sewer back up so bad it makes you sick. It is not worth the $30 to go to this place.  I am just not sure why the great rating. Like I said food was good but over priced. Add in the environment and this is not a great place.
2,"It's ok.  But we don't have many choices.\n\nThe other day I ordered a pizza for pickup.  When I got home I found out the order was wrong.  They didn't offer to bring me a new pizza or offer to give me a credit.    I wonder if they thought it was my fault for not checking the pizza before I left to store?  Either way, thought it was a strange customer service approach...\n\nFor the record, the pizza wasn't bad."
2,"Bachi Burger is always on my list of places to go when I am in Vegas. Went around 10pm on Saturday and of course we had to wait, that is never a problem since the food is always so good. Once we were seated, our server came pretty quickly and was nice. That was the best part of our terrible service! Our server took about 10 minutes to bring our strawberry lemonade to the table and after waiting over 20 to 25 minutes, we received our food but never received out appetizer. When we mentioned it to our server, he said that he would get it put in right away. We opted not to get it anymore as we had seen many other tables that came in after us receive multiple things before we received anything. Our server looked as if he was on drugs, very jittery as he attempted to show us his pad of paper showing us our order and saying it was not his fault. Mid way through our meal, we ordered food to go, we sat and waited for over 20 minutes and finally was approached asking if we have received our food. I proceeded to tell the other server that we were waiting for our to-go order. As he walked away, I saw him go up to the register area and find that our to-go order had been sitting in the counter. I could not believe how terrible the service was at Bachi burger! The food is always good, but I felt like the server should never have been serving people food! He made mistakes on every single table he was helping in our area and instead of apologizing, he made excuses!"
3,"You don't have to wear lederhosen to come to Waldhorn, but my theory has always been that it never hurts to wear lederhosen.  Wearing a fun outfit is just good times right off the bat.  \n\nI've eaten at Walhorn 8 or 10 times over the last couple years and love everything about Gitta's restaurant.  All of the food is excellent and I especially like the $5.50 \""buffet\"" that is available to Waldhorn Beer Club members on Tuesday nights.  I won't outline any particular meal for you because I've tried quite a few of them and have been disappointed by none. And the pretzel rolls are fantastic!  It's the best pretzel bread you've ever wrapped your lips around. They have a wonderful German beer selection and you are given the ability to choose your drink size up to a full liter.  I wish half pints would catch on at more bars Stateside.  \n\nBrian, the restaurant manager, is quite gregarious and will leave you with a smile on your face should you happen to meet him.  After a couple visits to Waldhorn you kinda feel like you're family."
1,"My first visit to Las Vegas -- my first time inside ANY casino -- was my stay at the Las Vegas Hilton.  This was a while ago.  Back when TI was called Treasure Island and they had pirates out front instead of sluts.  Back when Bellagio was still kinda new.\n\nBack then, the Hilton was reasonable enough and offered something to warm over any geek (like myself) who needed a reason to even stand in Las Vegas:  Star Trek:  The Experience.  Yes... the Hilton had a Trek thing and Trek casino on the premises.  There to reassure my generation that, yup, Vegas likes YOU too.  \n\nIt was fun staying at the Hilton at that point, comforting to know I wasn't on the big bad ominous STRIP.  And this is coming from someone who lived 4 years in Brooklyn, okay?\n\nBut then years passed and return trips taught me something.  The STRIP doesn't need to be in capital letters.  Like it's a SCARY place.  It's actually a safe fun BLAST if I must use all caps for something.  And so why in the freaky-deaky world --\n\n-- would you intentionally stay off the strip?  The hotel better be worth it, right?  Something extra special and extra different.  Or why bother?\n\nHaving recently visited the Las Vegas Hilton again, the best way I can put this is:  don't.  It's less than nothing special.  I actually found it very depressing.  The old girl has seen her last day, and unless she drops into Deep Space Nine for a retrofit, the bitch needs to be de-commissioned.\n\nWhy do I say depressing?\n\nFirst of all, that funky and fun Trek casino that was on the premises warped out some time ago.  That's okay.  I can forgive that.  What I can't forgive is that they left half of it behind.  Out of good ol' cheap laziness.  So if you drift around the casino enough, you'll find a slot machine 'spot' housed inside half of what was the Trek exhibit.  It's... bizarre.  They could have turned it into a futuristic bar of sorts if they really needed to 'keep' some of the metal and glass crap from the Trek thing.  But no, that would cost $$$$... wouldn't it?  And so they essentially did nothing.\n\nThe Hilton offers a host of cheezy Vegas singer/impersonator types.  They perform in this teeny tiny showroom that houses no more than 50 people at once.  Yes, that's right, nothing says you're about to see an amazing act than a theater that holds 50 people in it.  50 entire people.  To glock how depressing this is, know that the Hilton -- JUST THE HILTON -- houses over 3000 rooms.  \n\nThe night I was recently there, they slid a wall away from this showroom to show you what you were missing.  Yes, right off the casino, a line of people who didn't pay to see some fool 'croon' were watching the 'spectacle.'   Some guy who's miserable job was to come out and pretend to be 1/1000th as popular as Wayne Newton.  It made me want to become an alcoholic just watching him.\n\nMy partner in crime and I ended up seeing comedian Gilbert Godfried there.  In that same room of 50 or less people.  That was populated by two middleaged greasy photographers with bad hair and worse suits trying to take your picture for big bucks... in an age where everyone carries digital cameras... in a room a showroom about as special as Wayne World's basement.  DEPRESSING.\n\nAnd if this wasn't depressing enough, Gilbert was terrible.  Looked like an amateur.  And I really like this guy.\n\nNeed more?  You must be a glutton for punishment like me.  One of the 'big deal' restaurants in the Hilton is a Benihauna.  Yes, I enjoy Teppan Grill, but you can kinda get it anywhere these days.  True, you can't a Beni like the Hilton has... a giant village setting where you actually feel like you're in old Japan -- but the night I walked in there was a big hole in the ceiling.  Signs asking patrons to forgive the leaking water.  We walked out faster than we walked in --\n\n-- which is just what I'm recommending YOU do.\n\nIf you need affordable rooms in an okay resort, try NYNY and MONTE CARLO on the strip.  They're less depressing, have more life to 'em, and are ON the strip."
4,"I went to Madison last week and after reading good reviews on Yelp decided to stop at Dotty's for a burger. I ordered the Melting Pot and my boyfriend got the Heart Throb. Both burgers were absolutely delicious! The heart throb was spicy, but tolerable. And the melting pot was awesomely cheesey with a mayo-garlic sauce. I hate mayo, but this sauce was the boss. We also got cheese curds because of all the reviews about them on yelp, so yummy! The server was very sweet and the place had a great vibe.Overall  I loved it!\nI will definitely go here again the next time I find myself in Madtown."
2,"Most reviews of this location are better than mine.  I realize that.  I will give you the pros and cons to this hotel and you can decide from there.  Was this the worst place to stay, no but it was not the best either.  However, if you need or want to be able to walk to ASU or the stadium than this is the ONLY place I would recommend you stay.  That being said.... We stayed here when in town for a bowl game at ASU.  Hotel is walking distance to the stadium, an easy walk also.  This is a cute hotel.  No thrills but in no way a Motel 6 or anything like that.  It is very clean, simple decor, very modern.  Rooms are small.  They are clean as is the bathroom, this is a big plus. Beds are OK, they are not true Westin Heavenly Beds.  They are also a newer hotel.  Friendly service.  Everything is self serve.  I called for additional pillows and was told no problem just had to go down to the front desk to get them.  Food service is all self serve as well and there is a nice assortment of snacks and light fare am and pm. Sandwich type places are across the street too.   However, do not accept a room facing the freeway/In N Out, you can hear the road noise!  Also,   rooms are very stuffy.  Although it was a very cold night, had to run the A/C to breathe and it is a wall unit, very loud and ran off and on all night to hold room temp.  Top it off with the road noise and it was not the best nights sleep.  However, if you bring ear plugs, it may not be an issue.  I give it 3 stars because it was just OK."
1,The owners are extremely nice here. Polite and friendly. The food is just barely average however. I would NOT order sushi here and I doubt I would return.
0,"Really disappointed in this place. Thought it was a cool local place with yummy burgers but really just a health scare with very poor service (unless you sit at the bar - the bartenders are always great service). The table servers we've had were slow, unapologetic and surly. And the food was just not worth it. I like a spot of grease when I'm craving it, but the food was overly greasy-fried, and the burger buns were dry. Not very tasty. If you want to have a junk food splurge, I can think of dozens of places where I'd line up first. Each time I've eaten there, I've left feeling nauseated. I've given Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers a 2nd and even 3rd chance because it's right near my house and my hubby seems to like it, but today broke me: they just posted something on Facebook that involved not only one of their greasy little burgers but topped with bacon and egg... with a side of doughnut. I kid you not! There's a photo!"
3,"Such a headache.. I've had a membership with Envy since December, had no problems loved the massages (had only one bad experience, wasn't really that bad) until today! By the way, this is a venting session, the majority of my experience with the company has been REALLY good, massages are worth every penny.. this vent is about their computer system.. \n\nI have a really bad knot(s) in my shoulders so I got a membership. So, I use to go to the one in Tempe on Elliot, loved the location, stuff was amazing everything was great. My one kind of blah experience was probably on the third or fourth time I went the girl wanted to try pressure points as well as a regular massage. She did pressure points the majority of the time, didn't do a thing to help, didn't really feel anything... but anyway.. \n\nSo I moved out to the downtown area, and with their membership it is good at ANY Envy, like I could go to Kentucky and use it. Well went to this one on Camelback, called in to make an appointment... They couldn't find my membership on their computer after a few minutes of searching and checking name/phone number/address, they said they found it! However.. \n\nShowed up to the place to check in, couldn't find my membership, when they said that they found it they asked if I was still living on 48th st.. I have NEVER lived on 48th st... Asked if my number was a 602 number.. I have NEVER had a 602 number.. Asked if it could be under another name, no. ... Mom and dad don't make appointments for me anymore, and memberships are assigned to one person only, there are no couple deals.. Anyway went ahead and got my massage (it was okay, think I'd try some one else next time, which is kind of what you have to do, test out the people till you find one you really like)\n\nI was relaxed, and the front desk person said she would have everything figured out by the end of my massage (an hour).. Came out, no progress. So went through the dance again, I had my membership keychain so we double checked the number.. She called the Tempe Envy (where I started my membership), they couldn't find me either.. What the hell? My membership has disappeared! HOWEVER, they are still taking the monthly payments out of my account.. Interesting.. \n\nI left, leaving my phone number and all the info I could give them, once again assuring them the account was under my name and my name only.. anyway.. I called the Tempe location to get the same, we can't find you response, asked to talk to a manager, no one was available.. Camelback location called back saying they found me by my membership number.. why couldn't they find me the first time, I have no idea.. Apparently all my information was screwed up, including my name, which they said is COMMON? yikes.. I asked to check how many prepaids were left on my account, they said three which is what I have so good. \n\nHowever.. Tempe called me back saying they found me, my info was also screwed up, and I had no prepaids left.. umm no, so told them what Camelback told me and that they needed to talk to each other, she said they will just accept what Camelback had found.. All I can say out of this is at least they kept trying and finally did get it within twenty minutes after my massage.. \n\nSo my biggest advice is:\n- Good place for a massage? Yes\n- Good prices? Yea, great prices, best deal\n- Variety of massages? Yes, all for the same price and a variety of time lengths\n- Safe, clean, nice? Yes, Yes, Yes.. they change the sheets and wipe down everything between patients, they are very polite and pay attention to requests, let you know what to do and what they are doing etc..  Good customer service, those helping didn't give up or blame me\n- Good membership deal? Yes, its $49 a month which pays for a massage for you each month, if you don't go for a month the massage you missed rolls over to the next month, so like me I have 3 prepaid waiting for me to use, also if you need more then one its $39 for a hour (which is almost $20 less then non-members price) and its unlimited, and they pull the payment out of your account the same day every month\n\n*** BUT! double check that they have your membership info correct when you FIRST sign up, they fill it out for you, you just sign which is why things probably get screwed up.. and randomly check the info as your membership goes on and keep track of when you go so you know how many prepaids are there etc..\n\nSoo I really don't know how to star it, they did screw up my membership however their service is awesome.. so.. eh..  I wish we could do half stars sometimes.. I guess minus on star?"
4,"This is the best all-around meal I've had in a LONG time.  Simple, yet delicious.  We were seated quickly, granted it was a Sunday evening, however for a restaurant on the Strip I was impressed.  Of course we shared a fresh, hot blooming onion.  Call me crazy, but try it with Ketchup instead of the special sauce...my wife and friends are sold!  I ordered the New York Strip and it was amazing.  Perfectly seasoned and perfectly grilled.  My only negative critique is they rushed the appetizer/salad portion of the meal.  I felt like Kobiyashi trying to inhale my salad when my steak came out merely minutes after my salad, but that's ok.  My wife and her girlfriend shared the full rack of pork ribs, and I must admit they were delicious as well.  Any place that can fully satisfy the insatiable appetites of two pregnant women speaks volumes!  I would happily pay to eat here again."
0,I purchased a groupon for two for 80 minutes for my boyfriend's 21st  birthday that was $139. When I called to make my appointment I looked at the yelp reviews prior to see if anyone recommended any therapists. I asked for the popular therapists and immediately Sue asked if I have been here before. I wasn't sure and said yes I think so because I've been to massage places before but wasn't sure if it was this particular place. She demanded I pay full price and can't use the voucher. After she tried looking for me in the system and couldn't find me I was able to use the groupon. The day of the massage came and my boyfriend woke up with a sharp painful back pain and couldn't get out of bed. I called to ask if I could reschedule and Sue angrily addressed me by my name and said that I can't because I wasted two 80 minute blocks in her schedule. She came off so rude and irritated when I was being polite the entire time even after she kept being so rude over the phone. Something came up and I asked to reschedule. Things happen. She refused to let me reschedule. Regardless of the cancellation policy there was no reason to treat a customer with such irritation and anger. I'm sorry I couldn't make it. This was such an unprofessional experience and just wasted $139. If she were to handle this situation in a polite and calm manner I would not of been upset and just accepted that I wasn't able to make it.
2,Great place but inconsistent.
4,"Being from Orlando, a cuban breakfast is easy to come by, so when I came here on vacation I searched for one and was excited to find florida cafe. We ordered the cuban toast and cafe con leche with sides of eggs, and it is the perfect.breakfast. the service is a little inconsistent, sometimes we are charged for refills, sometimes we arent, but besides that they never disappoint!"
3,"We had just eaten at the Social House and were shimmied down the back stairs to Tangerine. ( 5 ladies out on the town)\n\nHad an awesome view of the Pirate/Siren show.  The drinks in Tangerine are good but what we liked the most was how friendly everyone was and the music was great.\n\nYes, its a small club but do you need a mega club really? One that takes you 30 minutes to cross the floor for a drink or a bathroom? - No you don't. \n\n Find Fun, Friends and a great dance party at Tangerine."
2,"A champagne brunch on Sunday here with gratuity costs $34 per person (we were in a large group).\n\nIf you like cold seafood like crab legs and shrimp cocktail, this is the place for you. For others who don't, there are quite a few other things you can try that will tingle your taste buds. For example, the crepes are great. Have one with nutella and banana, or try the pasta or any of the breads they have. The Greek food station was average, and they skimped on the chicken in the fetuccini. \n\nI thought they lacked a bit of variety. Service was great though and the champagne was actually nice (not the cheap stuff that tastes like cheap wine with fizz).\n\nOverall, an average experience, and a bit over-hyped."
4,"Overall :\nIf you eat nothing else on your visit to Montreal, you must try Ta Pies.  Seriously - go out of your way, this place is a gem.\n\nFood :\nMy partner had the buttered chicken (sort of a curry chicken flavor) and I had the beef and cheese.  Hers was delicious and really flavorful, mine was excellent.  The crust was buttery and flaky, and the filling was well seasoned with the cheese as an accent rather than an overwhelming element.  My partner lived in Australia for a while and confirmed, these were pretty perfect and totally authentic.  I have never put anything in my mouth that made me this happy.\n\nEverything Else :\nNot much else to say - seating is sparse and mostly outdoors.  Service is counter-style ordering.  Decor... no real impression.  I don't take any stars off for this because Ta Pies is exactly what it seems like - a side of the road pie stand for you to grab a handheld bite and go.  Perfect!"
0,"I recently went to check out 44 Monroe as a prospective tenant. The lobby was very classic and clean. I really wanted to like this place. Everything after that gets disappointing. I have to agree with previous reviewers that yes there are some questionable residents at this very expensive high rise apartment. The elevators are basic and clean. After getting out of the elevator I noticed the hallways were dark, not so clean and had a peculiar smell. It smelled like old smoke and as we approached the apartment door I smelled fresh weed. The apartment I previewed had all carpet flooring except in the kitchen and bathroom. I think they said they only have carpet in apartments. The one bedroom was very large with a big balcony for around $1700 a month. \n\nThe pool area is big and mostly enclosed except a small area is exposed to sunlight. They have a very nice outdoor clubhouse/patio near the pool.\n\nThis apartment will appeal to you if you don't mind carpet, smoke and interesting people. Also if you don't care much for a pool. \n\nI truly believe they should rethink their policy on smoking. It will preserve the building much better and it will be a lot more appealing to prospective residents. The cigarette smoke gets stuck EVERYWHERE for YEARS. I remember my family rented apartments before and we could smell old smoke any time we turned on the AC because the vents were dirty. \n\nI hope I helped some of you with your downtown apartment search."
0,"Over priced and they forgot my friends pizza order, so I had to wait while mine got cold until theirs came. \nTook way too long to get my drink refills."
1,"I was fairly unimpressed with my food at Ri Ra... I ordered the lamb burger, which consisted of an under seasoned, overly large portion of ground lamb with a bit of feta on a bun.\n\nRi Ra redeems itself a bit with a nice pub atmosphere. Although... a more unique selection of Irish brews would be a nice improvement."
4,"Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere,and healthy menu options make this place a great choice any time of the day."
4,"Santa Margarita for 17 bucks!! Really can't beat that considering it's close to 30 in the grocery stores and at target. Plus they have a huge variety of beers, which is awesome for my hubby who is a beer lover. The sales associates are friendly and helpful. They often recommend cheaper wines similar to the pricey ones I've have grown to love. I've had a lot of luck with many of their recommendations."
3,"Beet salad, all the nigiri, foie gras chawan-mushi was soooooo yummy! Great service too!"
1,"I love my Mexican food but I don't love overpriced Mexican food. \n\nRecently on a Vegas trip with some girl friends, we stayed at the Luxor. As we were still recovering from the night before, we decided to make dinner easy and just head downstairs to T&T. I understand that we were on The Strip in Vegas but $13 (before tax and tip) for a chicken quesadilla is pretty ridiculous. There was nothing special about it and I only ate about half before I couldn't choke down any more cheese.\n\nThe chips and salsa were slightly better but I would have preferred a traditional red salsa instead of the green salsa and the chipotle (I think?) salsa. \n\nI'll save a few bucks and pass on T&T in the future."
3,"I was pleasantly surprised by Teakwoods. \n\nIt is a large sports bar/grill with above average pub food. Four of us popped by here on our way to the bowling alley (around the corner) and had a great time. Everyone enjoyed their dinner, brews, and the classic rock music.\n\nI wouldn't spend an entire night-out here, but it was just the trick to kick-start the evening."
0,"I had eaten here 2 weeks ago and I ordered a foot long hot dog and fries for 3.99 and I thought \""what a great deal\"". I went back today and the same meal was 6.90! I was taken by the huge jump in price. The clerk had a bit of an attitude when I asked about the increase.  I was also told a drink comes with the meal, (which I did not want) I told the clerk I did not receive a drink on my last visit. She did not apologize for the mistake or offer to give me the drink I did not get last time. She also told me fries are a premium side dish and cost .47 extra. Really? fries? The menu has an excessive amount of \""hidden\"" extra costs. I asked for my money back and will not be returning. I know prices increase, but almost double the price and the attitude was not necessary."
4,"This place was everything I ever wanted as far as mexican food goes. I ordered the mexican pizza, which was absolutely delicious!!! Salsa & chips were also great.  They had live mariachi. I have found a mexican restaurant that meets my expectations :)"
3,"Never a bad experience in the 3 plus years I have ordered from here. Nice when you are in a hurry and absolutely love the pizza tracker (not sure more places don't do this). Sure it's a chain, but I enjoy the pizza, the prices, and the service. Thank you Dominos!"
4,"You know, it may be crowded on weekends, hard to get a seat, drinks could be slow getting to the table - I've experienced all of these things on my four or five visits to Howl at the Moon. But, each visit, I've had a phenomenal time with friends, singing, laughing, drinking and dancing in my chair. Each time I leave, I think, \""we have to come back here again soon \"". So, how could I not give it a five? My favorite girls night out destination."
4,"I barely went a gym at all before crossfit - it was boring, and I didn't know what to do. At the recommendation of some friends, I tried Freestyle Crossfit since it was on the way to work and had convenient times. I could barely do a pushup! A little while later, and I can at least make a solid showing at things I would have never even considered before. Jake, Cody, and the rest of the staff are encouraging and even make total beginners feel comfortable doing their best while making sure we're not going to hurt ourselves doing something wrong. \n\nIf you're considering a workout you should drop in for a session - but give it at least a few times before you decide it's not for you. The demo WOD is rough if you're not already active!"
4,wow really awesome place we had a steak sandwich which was hugh enough to share. The dessert looked great could not get any from being so full from our meal. we will be going there for desert next time we are in vegas.
1,I love Starbucks but this one I try to avoid because they are always so busy. Drive threw I usually wait 15-20 minutes .
0,"If you them to be out of what you want, paying for your order to be made wrong or to wait in a drive through for 20-30 minutes, go to this location.  8 or 9 times out of ten these things will happen.  Awful.  When they get it right(rarely), the food and smoothies are good, but all this consistently still happening is inexcusable.  I think I'll take my money somewhere where they know what they're doing."
1,"war nicht so unser Fall: recht teuer, herablassender Service und irgendwie eine unangenehme Atmosph\u00e4re - man f\u00fchlt sich von dem, was wohl \""Stammpublikum\"" merkw\u00fcrdig beobachtet. Wir waren Sonntag da, weil im Internet etwas von einem Brunch stand, den gibt es aber gar nicht mehr. Unsere Anregung, den Text im Netz zu \u00e4ndern, wurde ignoriert hnd weggel\u00e4chelt. \u00c4rgerluch, wenn man wie wir, von weiter kommt."
4,Always great service and great food! Parking isn't great but they have a fast turnaround so there isn't too long of a wait.
3,"Probably one of the top two breakfasts to be had in Madison. Fresh, delicious and with lots of choices, as well as healthy options. It's nice to get locally grown food when you eat out so this is a plus for Marigold. Not too expensive either. We paid the same price for breakfast for three that we do at Denny's (a guilty pleasure!)."
4,I was visiting Vegas when my car broke down. I was fortunate to have someone refer me to HI Star auto center. It took them about an hour to fix my car no run around no parts need it. I was blown about with their professionalism and honesty. If you are ever in need of a great mechanic go see them.
3,"Probably one of the better options for Asian food in KW. \n\nThe restaurant looks awesome, food is good, prices are decent, the help is really helpful. :)\n\nOne bad thing, actually the only one, is that if the restaurant is busy, the noise level is unbelievably high. Think Rude Native lounge with the live band. :)"
2,"this place is a very up scale chinese restaurant that i wont be coming to again lol. we only came here because another place wouldnt let us go in with our shorts on so lame.\n\nthe 7 of us ate family style, we did the assorted bbq, the duck, the mongolian beef, the fried rice, something noodle, kung pao chicken.\n\nim chinese so i know what its suppose to taste like haha and it wasnt as good as home but it was kinda tasty? but do you want to pay 150% more than like panda express for kinda tasty food?\n\nthe service there is like any other asian place, nonexistent. ill admit since this place is in the Wynn its super nice, but its very sub par to me. for what im paying at least, i shouldnt have to ask for refills, please check on my table.\n\nand what is with the being cheap on rice at asian places? rice is super cheap and it cost nothing to make a shit ton, and yet the 7 of us had to share 3 small bowls. so lame."
4,I love the spicy chicken teriyaki low carb plate. It's a different take on Japanese food. The vegetables very good w the cabbage. Try it!  The yokisaba and the regular chicken teriyaki plates are very good as well.  Good quality ingredients and it shows in the final product.  Yummy!
0,The description says this restaurant has waiter service ... I beg to differ.  That's all I have to say about this one.
3,"One of my favorite restaurant's in Charlotte.  The amtmosphere alone makes it a pleasure.  On top of that the staff a friendly and quick to make suggestion what is good on the menu.  Menu has a wide variety of item to please just about anyone.  If you want to get a table would suggest making a reservation.  Deserts are not that large, however definetly pack with plenty of flavor.  Their Cheesecake in my opinion is better than Cheesecake Factory.   Excellent choice for special events or a networking luncheon.  You can even dine ouside on the patio during certain times of the year.  Overall a must for the Foodie inside us."
2,"Trust me if you have never been here you should definately check it out, but keep in mind that your first time should be your last time checking it out! I came here couple years ago with a friend of mines and nothing really has changed other than the fact of couple new people and with Shaq in a Phoenix jersey rather than a Miami jersey, thats it! \n\nI would only recommend people to check this place out probably once every 5 years or so."
1,"We had over an hour until our flight. Ordered a plain vegetable salad, nachos, and crop circle beer. The beer was warm and flat and got a new one, which was only slightly better. (And cost $8!)\n\nAfter about 40 minutes of waiting the waitress came over and asked us what our order was. We then watched her go to her computer and put in our order. With 15 minutes to boarding time, we finally got our salad (bread was forgotten) and then the nachos. Probably won't go back."
4,"FOOD: 4 stars\nAMBIENCE: 4 stars\nSERVICE: 5 stars\nVALUE for price (taking location into account): 4.5 stars\n\nWould give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I'm generous of heart and round up.\n\nWhat we had:\nBeef Brisket Taquitos: 4 stars (5 stars for plating)\nYucatan Pork: 4.5 stars (4 stars for plating)\nA Tecate and a Corona\n\nre: food - one of the nice things about Border Grill is that they clearly place an emphasis on consistency.  I've frequented their LA location, and noticed no difference in the style or quality of the food.  This shows great management.  Beef brisket taquitos were very good (but sauce was too mild for my spicy-loving tastes); Yucatan pork was the winner.  I also love that Border Grill doesn't overcook rice.\n\nre: ambience - typical Border Grill decor, but not their best location.  Patio overlooks the \""Lazy River\"" at Mandalay Bay - a slow-moving waterway filled with children and extremely fat adults floating along in inner tubes.  I cam to think of it as the \""River of Pee,\"" but I digress...)  It was pretty warm that day.  The gigantic fan outside is misleading; it doesn't seem to do anything to circulate air or cool the patio down.  Seems poorly designed.  It was also a little loud thanks to the packed pool.  But not awful.  Inside probably would've been the better choice, and we chose incorrectly.\n\nre: service - Border Grill Las Vegas delivered big on service with a fabulous plus host/waiter (we thought the charming man who seated us was the host, but we later saw him waiting on another section.)  Our waiter was also attentive without being over-bearing.  Never had to wait for anything or ask twice.\n\nre: price - cocktails looked to be about the same as LA prices.  Food had roughly a 20-25% Las Vegas premium over LA prices, but I suppose that's to be expected because 1) it's the Strip, and 2) they're probably trucking a lot of fresh ingredients into agriculturally-challenged Vegas.)"
0,"the owners are rude and awful.  They think they own the shopping center and they do not, the send people away, which is good, who wants to shop there anyway.  Great people that I know will not ever go to this place.  They would rather go to TOYS R US OR BABIES R US, which are cheaper and management and these stores are nicer."
2,"Chanpen is closed. It is now a Thai BBQ place. I loved Chanpen, and the pad thai noodles at the BBQ place were not very good. I heard the chicken is great. But I had a craving for noodles."
2,"It's like this - This place is not the type of place that you want to see. You don't want to know that your food is coming from somewhere this sticky and dirty. \n\nBut, I have yet to find General Tso's tofu that is half as delicious as the one they have there. It's SO good. Also, the vegetables are always crisp and fresh, and you can tell they made your food right before they brought it to you. The egg rolls are pretty tasty too. Basically, it's really good American Chinese food.\n\nNow if it the place wasn't such a disaster..."
3,"I just stayed here for 5 days for the weekend of April 9th. We wanted something cheap but yet something centrally located and somewhere we won't get pregnant just from sleeping on the bed. Checked in on Thursday and out on Monday. \n\nAfter booking the room I read the reviews in this place. I immediately regretted not reading the reviews first. But It was too late to cancel so I said f it and said we will try it for ourselves. \n\nI originally booked the cheapest room, which I think was the deluxe room. When we checked in the lady was very nice and highly encouraged us to upgrade to the next room... Then she very easily persuaded us by saying the next rook up is only $10 more a night and the she told us the room I booked was remodeled about 18-20 years ago () but the next room up was only $10 extra a night and was remodeled 8-10 years ago. We were immediately sold.  She then asked if we wanted the noisy side (facing the strip) or that quiet side. Us two being there to party, we requested the noisy side. I asked if there was a refrigerator in the room. She said they are $10 extra a night but she said she will throw it I'm since we upgraded. That was very impressive. \n\nWe got to the 10th floor and found our room. Going into this with a bad taste after reading the yelp reviews I expected to be disgusted. I was pleasantly surprised by the room. It was actually decent. Nothing like staying at a fancy hotel but it got the job done. \n\nNow we go to the bad things:\nAll sinks drained very slow \nParking was kinda scarce\nThe elevators smelled like weed ALL DAY EVERY DAY. \nThe entire building smelt like cigarette smoke. \nThe carpet in the hallways/rooms needed to be quarantined. \n\nOverall, our stay was pleasant and I'd stay there again based on the value. \n\nGive this place a chance unless you're a princess, then stay at the Palazzo. Hope this info helps. \n\nBtw, if you like to party, go to the pool at the Flamingo.  It's 21+ and a blast!"
3,Don't do the nachos. Pretty generic Sysco canned cheese and chips.\nGood service at the bar tho. Shannon was great.\nI've ate here before and good service and good but you can tell some/most of the stuff is Sysco food.
2,"VERY difficult ingress and egress.  It doesn't take an archiecture degree to see that whoever planned this one out has some issues.  I would recommend going through the drive-thru to get your caffiene fix since you must use the drive-thru to exit the parking lot in most cases.  If there happens to be a parking space along the main road, grab it if you want to go inside.  \n\nThe associates are warm and friendly and the coffee is good and strong.  Be carefull about the items made with the hot water, though, as the water is more of a luke-warm than hot."
1,You get a lot of food for the price but the restaurant is dirty and they charge you 50 cents for each to-go box.
2,Was psyched in trying out Bobby flay ' s burger joint. At first I was disappointed because they weren't vegetarian friendly. They didn't have veggie burgers in their menu. so I just ended up ordering their griddled cheese and my man tried their original crunchy burger. My griddled cheese had good cheese in it.. but the sandwich was kinda mushy Because of the juice of the tomato which was in b/n the cheese and it tasted salty as well and to top it off the pickle just made it more salty. \n\nAccording to my man his crunchy burger was juicy but it tasted salty too and the chips in between just made it more  saltier.  They must have placed too much salt when they seasoned their burgers as well as the tomato/salsa of my griddled cheese sandwich.\n\nThe service on the other hand was great! I liked how the staff were so attentive. The interior of the place was nice too for a burger joint.\n\nThe price wasn't really worth it though. .
1,"Poor value for the price.  Pillows were not comfortable, tv was 20 years old, toilet would run until you jiggled the handle, the shower leaked all over the bathroom floor every time we took a shower, the faucet in the shower didn't work properly, the thermostat was very old and temperamental, there were holes in the walls in the bedroom and bathroom as well as the front door, and the carpet was filthy.  We found out later that the floors on our tower are scheduled to be remodeled but the standard of our room was unacceptable for the price we paid."
2,"In my opinion, there's nothing above average about these thin, over-salted burger patties. \n\nSmashburger gets one star for a nice and clean restaurant, and two stars for the smashfries (rosemary, garlic, olive oil - delicious). \n\nI ordered the Spicy Baja burger. It comes with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato, and spicy chipotle mayo on a chipotle bun. When I placed my order, I asked for avocado instead of guacamole. It wasn't until I sat down that I realized they charged me $2 extra for that substitution. Usually, I wouldn't mind, and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't guacamole made by mashing up avocado? And the piece of avocado that came on top of my burger was the size of two fingers and all I could do was roll my eyes. \n\nOverall, the burger was nothing special. The patty was salty and a little dry and did not have much flavor. The burger was not juicy, it was greasy. There is a difference. Why eat here when you can walk 50 feet north and have In N Out?\n\nMy friend ordered the Sin City Burger and when he was about half way through his burger, he looked at me and said, \""this just might be the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth.\"" O_o\n\nPerhaps I did not order the right burger, or perhaps I'm just a little picky when it comes to burgers... but I am not a fan."
4,"We went to this show to see what it was all about. I see his billboards and hear he is a nutcase but I kept hearing he put on a good show. We have seen a lot of shows in Vegas some better than others.....\n\nWe sat front row center. WOW, were we close....We should have sat in second row center, lol. This theater is very small but everyone feels involved. \n\nThe show was great with props, jokes, slight impressions. I was pleasantly surprised needless to say. \n\nDO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND CHECK IT OUT!!!"
1,"Good HH, wont go any other time due to all the tool bags running around in their affliction gear! No thanks. Good HH food and drinks and conveniently close but I would not come here if it gets too packed with college scum! I hate MILL AVE as it is but since I live close its not bad if you come early and bail when all the College douchebags start rolling in. The staff is typical too cool for school college kids who have no idea how the service industry really works. Clueless! Sometimes it's OK, most of the time its mediocre! I have only been here twice for HH, but the taco's are still expensive for what they are. The food is decent though as mentioned. Just stay away if it is super busy! They can't handle the crowd."
3,What can I say? The cheese curds rock and the prices are ultra reasonable. \n\nIt's a simple as that.
