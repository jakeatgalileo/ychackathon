0,"Let me start out by saying that I although I have traveled to Asia many times, I have not been to Korea and have limited experience with their cuisine.\n\nIn a word, Woo-Che Asian Grill Buffet is just awful. There are several buffet stations to chose from. The first area is a selection of chilled raw or marinated beef, chicken, and shrimp. You choose what you want and then bring them back to your table which has a built-in grill. Sounds good so far, right? The other stations include a rice station, chilled veggies, sushi and Japanese selections, kimche, and other assorted Korean favorites.\n\nWhere do I start?\n\nThe buffet sections that are supposed to be chilled are only slightly cooler then room temperature and the foods that are supposed to be hot are tepid at best. Honestly, I am shocked that the health department hasn't shut them down. \n\nNow to the food. Okay, I know I just said that food wasn't kept at proper temperatures...and we should have looked at the buffet before being seated, but the people that I was with decided they wanted to give it a try. I admit to being a sheep...and without protest, I stayed.\n\nThe unknown meats were somewhat disgusting. OMG, they were so chewy and gristly I had to choke them down or pull bits out of my mouth. The marinated chicken had a weird coloration. Of course, like an idiot, I ate some. \n\nThe bottom line is that the meats were actually quite bad. The rice was cold, the pieces of stuff they called \""sushi\"" were at room temperature, and the Korean specialties that they offered were not to my liking. That may be due to the fact that I'm unfamiliar with Korean food. Nobody went back for seconds...and this is an all-you-can-eat joint! That says a lot.\n\nTo boot, it's fairly spendy for lunch at $12.99. Not outrageous, but high considering the food quality. \n\nWhen we drove out of the parking lot we took odds (hey, we're in Vegas!) on whether or not we would get food poisoning. I figured there was a 30% chance I would get sick, but fortunately I was fine and nobody else in my party felt the least bit ill. A miracle. \n\nThis definitely ranks up there with one of the worst meal experiences I've ever had. Even if they fixed the hot/cold situation, I wouldn't go back. The unfortunate part is that it really turned me off from ever trying Korean food again."
0,So I actually have two reviews for this place and both are bad. I went in with my daughter (a 2 year old) and received some of the worst service of my life. Then for a $20 bill they charged my card $50. When I call the manager they took care of it and said they would send coupons which I never got.  My family and I tried eating there again yesterday afternoon. The service was horrible again. No refills on drinks and we didn't even get silver wear.  We ordered my daughter grilled chicken and apple slices.  The chicken they server my 2 year old was raw inside. This is completely unexpectable. I would not recommend this place to anyone and be very careful what you eat there
2,"Pies Pies Pies are the ONLY reason I come here. I stopped dining at the infamous MC quite some time ago after a bad meal experience.\n\nTheir desserts are the only saving grace because the food is overpriced for salty and skimpy meal portions. \n\nThe Decatur street location closed, so now I drive over to the remaining Sahara location to pick up pies for special occasions. Their food has gone downhill, way downhill to the point of no return. I miss the MC of the 1980's and early 90's when they had delicious food."
1,"Wether the customer is a high roller VIP spending almost 1k on dinner alone (which we were) or just an average Joe, you can NEVER EVER ask him to leave because you need the table for your next party. Bad form."
2,"My fianc\u00e9 and I and currently living down the street from Joe's! We drove past this place multiple times, we noticed this place being packed inside and the parking lot. We thought we should give it a try since it looked so popular.\n\nWe ordered the mango shaved ice and cherry flavor with soft serve ice cream. The overall taste wasn't bad, but it didn't have much flavor and other places I've tried. \n\nI wouldn't be against going back and having a treat, but It wouldn't be on the top of my list."
4,"The series of 1 star reviews below is unfair, they place only has like 30 chairs in it total, in order to serve 30 people at one sitting, they would have to close the restaurant down.  I wish there was a civil service requirement where everyone would have to work in a restaurant.  The fact that these people assume they are the judges of east valley taste is ridiculous, I would hate to be around a table of 30 people all scheming to write bad reviews of the place their still in...\n\nEnough ranting.  The service here is very nice, the staff knows the place backwards and forwards and the decor is well kept and very Northern New Mexican.  It's a little disconcerting from the outside, par for many great places in Mesa.\n\nThe food is spectacular.  This is food that it takes time to make.  Pecan wood smoked shrimp, pork abodova all take time and good ingredients to get right.\n\nWe did it right here.  Had the New Mexican Corn Chowder to start, creamy and delicious.  Margaritas are huge and very good.\n\nFor dinner I had the Taos platter, Tenderloin Rejeno, Shrimp Enchilada and smoked pork tamale.  All of which were great.  I am a huge eater and could not finish my plate.\n\nWe did have room for a glass of port, nice liquor selection btw and an order of their banana creme brule which was a nice end to a nice meal.\n\nGreat place, great way to ditch the sonoran mexican food blues.  Unless you like Sonoran cheese and grease on a plate.  These chips and salsa were great, verde salsa and multicolored corn chips.  Yes!\n\nOh yeah, also very affordable, no dish is over $20, including the great steak my gf had."
1,Heard about how good desserts were here. Decided to try. Frozen hot chocolate was whatevers. Tastes like chocolate shake. Nothing special. Decor didn't even look that good.
1,"Not Impressed!!! Read some of the other reviews of this place and thought I would still give them a try. Yelpers were right, to cool to help you out, would rather BS with each other and not help anybody out. Walked around their very small place for about 20 minutes, looking in their cases, NOT A WORD to me asking me if I'd like to look at anything. Twice I have gone in this place and just think their Customer Service is just AWFUL!"
2,"Food: Simply delicious. First time I've ever had a falafel sandwich served as a wrap, but it worked nicely, it was much less messier than when served in pita bread. The falafel were a bit dry but had a great, strong flavor to them. I was told the sandwich would come with a \""salad\"", but that salad ended up being three or four pickled vegetables. The baba ghanouj was was cold which leads me to believe that it may have been frozen at some point, but it tasted great either way. The presentation of all the food was great too, it wasn't just tossed on a plate, they actually put some work into arranging it, which is an important detail that is often overlooked by most restaurants. \nI didn't order anything to drink, but did notice a few beers in a cooler... It'd be awesome if they had some Mediterranean soft drinks or beers, like Maccabee or Goldstar. I realize it's probably expensive to import beers, but it's something to consider.\n\nService: The waitress we had was very attentive even though she was the only one there and seemed to be swamped with work... I think she was cooking and serving and bundling carryout orders all at the same time.\n\nAmbiance - This is where the place loses stars:\nThe interior of this place needs some work, the retro booths accompanied by tables that have the tablecloth stapled on are a bit too tacky. The smallest table could barely fit one person, but the only other size table seats 6! I went on a Sunday evening and there was literally no one else there, but they were pretty busy with carryout orders. And for some reason the AC was cranked on to the 45\u00b0F setting (even though it was only 70 outside)...which took away from the mediterranean feel. Also, something needs to be done about the ridiculously bright fluorescent lights, it's like they were borrowed from the neighboring liquor store... gave the whole place a very industrial feel, no warmth.\n\nSummary:\nI don't make it to Champaign too often, but when I go to visit my sister at U of I (Go Illini !!), I will most likely head back here because the falafel sandwich was delicious and the portions were very filling. Hopefully by that time they've improved the interior and go for a more authentic feel. Meanwhile, I'll stick to Pita Inn in the Chicago area."
3,"Yum.  Nothing like beating the heat with some frozen custard.  Being an east coast boy, this reminds me of summer vacations at the shore.  if they can hook it up with a vanilla/orange swirl, I'll be in heaven.\n\nMy first time out I only had a simple sundae.  Vanilla ice cream with peanut butter sauce.  My only complaint was that my cup was empty too quickly.\n\nThe rest of the items on the menu sound equally delicious, and I am sure I will try out these concretes and other sundaes.\n\nA few thoughts:\n1 - The collection of ice cream scoopers on the walls is pretty fun to look at\n2 - you can get custard to take home, in quarts!\n3 - There are a few restaurants in the same strip mall, so this is a great dessert\n4 - What the hell is a bumbleberry?"
0,D\u00e9cor awful.  Atmosphere cheap.  Service slow. Food mediocre.
2,"Food 5 Stars - Service 3 stars.  We went on New Years Eve, and the restaurant was crowded... but not that crowded.  We had a reservation for 7 - they put us in a cramped rounded booth - maybe room for 5-6.  One server asked us for drinks, and then no one came to get our order... ten minutes later we asked the drink server, about ordering, and he said he wasnt' our server and left.  Finally after getting the managers attention, we got a server.   Anyway - seemed like we were an inconvenience to the manager.  She didn't smile once- looked irritated at everyone the whole time we were there."
3,"This place is everything that all the other reviews have said before me.  The food here is quite simply - awesome.\n\nI've been a few times.  I've ordered the Cajun Pasty and the Pesto Pasty.  Both are very good options if you like chicken.  I usually eat half and save the other half for the next day.  It's still good heated up the next day.\n\nWhat I like the most about this place is the food comes out remarkably quick.  I've gone for lunch on various occasions, arriving around 11:45 each time.  I've gone with one person or with 4 or 5 other people and the food always came out in a reasonable amount of time - even with the restaurant packed to the hilt with hungry folks.  I give them an A+ for their speed given their popularity.\n\nThis establishment is fairly odd in a quirky way that makes you want to return.  The decor has \""character\"".  I suppose the intention is to replicate a English Pub.  I'm not sure.  They expanded the dinging room in recent years and the new dining room is full of these very long tables where the seating looks like what used to be a church bench.  A little awkward whilst you try to chump down on your pasty.  Nonetheless and church bench aside, however you have to sit, its definitely worth your time to visit this establishment."
0,"This restaurant is a joke. The food is mediocre at best and the service is severely lacking. No friendliness or promptness here, that's why it's usually empty of customers.\n\nPork dishes often come out lukewarm and untasty. Very bland. Deserts seem unethnic and store-purchased. Servers are very short and unassuming.\n\nOverall, a big disappointment for me with a big price tag attached--that's right, it's pricey, especially for the service and the food that you get.\n\nI don't recommend this one, it's a disappointment all around. All of my Cuban friends also said that this is as unauthentic as you get with Cuban food and to stay away...I wish I heard this advice before I spent my money here."
3,"I've been going to Cravings for lunch about 2-3 times a month for the last 1.5 years, and have had a whole bunch of items on their menu. Most items on their American menu and Chinese menu are just fine (wouldn't get more than a 3-star ranking), but their ma la fish and Singapore chow fun are absolutely amazing!!! And the best part is that you get a lot of food for ~$8!"
0,"Note to self: If the staff behind the counter is fighting loudly with each other, just leave. \n\nThe boyfriend and I needed a quick breakfast this AM so we decided to head over to P. Croissant. We've been before and while the croissants are overpriced, they're decent so we figured it would be a good option. We were wrong.\n\nWe walked in and it was relatively busy. There was a short line so we found our place in the queue and were quickly greeted with the sounds of two staffers fighting loudly with each other. Good Morning to you too! They were both obviously stressed out and were blaming each other for their own freak out but it made us feel very uneasy. We ordered two breakfast sandwiches and I don't even think I got a thank you.\n\nWe then proceeded outside to find a table to sit at but almost every chair (and table) had bird poop all over it. The one chair that didn't had something (orange juice I hope) spilled on it. And I'm not talking about a little spec of bird crap. There was enough to really gross me out. So, back inside.\n\nWe finally get our sandwiches. They were okay. The bacon was pretty rubbery - probably because they microwave everything. But honestly even if the sandwich had been amazing, the atmosphere created by the staff was so off-putting I lost my appetite. \n\nI know working in food is not easy but fighting in front of customers again and again is just not acceptable."
1,"I would say this place is definitely overrated. Stayed here for one night during Super Bowl weekend. Check in was fine, but when I got to the room I noticed several things that were not up to Marriott standards for any hotel.\n\n1. Dirty underwear and hooker cards all over the closet. Simply went to get the iron and found them all over. Gross!\n2. Blood or semen stains on the shower curtain. Looks like they had been there awhile. Makes me think of a motel 6\n3. Shower had poor water pressure and did not get fully hot. Also did not drain well and after the first shower had soap scum all around the floor.\n4. Refrigerator already had items missing from it which I think they charged me for. Have an $11 charge on my bill for something and it doesn't even tell you what it's for.\n5. Phone did not work. This is what finally prompted me to complain. Went down to the front desk and told them everything. They sent someone up to look into the phone problem and had no idea about my other complaints. The guy was mostly just making excuses for everything and said he would give me $50 off the room.\n\nIn all it wasn't the casino or restaurants that were bad, but the customer service and the room. Something I'm sure Marriott and other guests would like to hear about. There are better hotels on the strip for the money."
4,I had all my engine caps and strut tower brace done here. The strut tower brace matches the car with with race stripes perfectly aligned with the oitside paint. Very professional and great pricing!!
1,"The past few times I visited Vegas I stayed at either the Venetian or the Wynn. This last time I decided to try out THEHotel at Mandalay Bay because I wanted the spacious room and I wanted to try somewhere new. I wanted to like the hotel because Mandalay seems like a great hotel with one of the largest pools but I was unimpressed and at some points just down right disappointed.\n\nTo start off, I got to the hotel early on my check in day so I had decided to try and check in early, around 1 pm, check in is usually at 3 pm. The front desk told me the room wasn't available yet, which I kind of expected, but they told me I can go through the check in process now and that they would call me when the room is available. So I wandered around the hotel, visited the Shark Reef aquarium (small but not too bad), ate some lunch, and checked out the shopping area (also small). 3 pm came and still no call. At 3:30 pm I checked at the front desk again to see if the room was ready but again was told it wasn't and that it would be ready soon. By this time I was tired and just wanted to rest somewhere, preferably the room. The rest of my party wasn't arriving until 5 pm and I hoped to relax in the room before they came. I sat around in the lounge area and waited for another hour and half. I went to the front desk again to check if the room was ready and was finally told it was (2 hours after the actual check in time), for some reason I wasn't called like they said they would.\n\nOn my way up to the hotel room, the first thing I noticed was that the hall smelled; the best way I can describe the smell is like an old car that has the fabric seats that has been sitting in the sun way too long. When I got into the room it was the same smell, very overwhelming; I had to call room service to bring up some air freshener spray and I opened up all the bottles of lotion hoping to have their scents disperse throughout the room. The size of the room was nice but the room itself felt very old; there were scratches on the bar cabinet, the tables, and the TV stand. I also found gum on the wall. For such a high end hotel, the room was a huge disappointment.\n\nThe rest of our stay was uneventful, nothing great but nothing horrible either. One restaurant I would definitely recommend is the Border Grill. The food was excellent and the blood orange margarita is amazing. The pool area is definitely big; it was crowded when we went but it was also Labor Day weekend so that was expected.\n\nAfter check out, I found an additional $56 charge on my card that was not on my bill. When I called the hotel to find out what this was, I was told it was an extra housekeeping charge. When I asked specifically what for (because we may have left some towels here and there, and some extra cups and bottles by the bar but nothing too messy), they just told me it took the housekeepers extra time to clean our room. I have never been one to trash the hotel room and I even make sure the trash we do leave behind is all in one area so it's easy for the housekeepers to pick up. With that being said, I was shocked to have this extra charge especially when they can't specifically tell me what was \""extra dirty\"" about the room and also since the room didn't appear that clean to me from the beginning.\n\nI was disappointed from the get go and this extra charge was just the icing on the cake. At least I can say that I tried the hotel myself but I will definitely not be staying for a second time."
4,"My wife and I had an awesome time with my wife. The food was awesome and the drink selection was impressive. The service was great, we will be back!"
0,Lies! Takes your survey and claims he will write everything up for your HOA since he deals with them all the time and get your fence approval.  Come to find out months later the HOA never spoke to this guy and he has a bad rep for telling similar lies!  Now I'm having to work with my HOA and neighbor to resolve the issue of never being approved.  Owner of this fence company has since stopped answering my phone calls and he will be facing a small claim law suit if more money has to go into this fence.  Avoid this company and look elsewhere!!
4,"Best cafe in Madison. They use Inteligencia coffee, offer pour-overs, serve Rishi tea, and have a great environment in which to do homework."
0,"By god, what an abhorrable experience.  One star is far too good for this dump. \n\nMy wife and I stayed here the Saturday and Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, 2012.  The individual who checked us in and who was working the evenings, Andrea (I believe), and the male fellow working in the mornings/day (never got his name) clearly do not know what the phrase \""customer service\"" means.  Here's a sampling, dear readers, of what we had to experience.  I will number them so you do not get lost, there's THAT many instances:\n\n1.  When we arrived, there was no, \""Welcome to Quality Inn/Charlotte/insert appropriate greeting here\"" by the attendant, Andrea.  It was a short, curt \""Reservation?\""  Answering in the affirmative, she uttered, \""Method of payment and driver's license please.\"".  Mind you, during this entire interaction it was conveyed that we were clearly infringing on her time.  We were never made to feel at home.  She gave us room 200, which should never be allowed for human occupation.  \n\n2. We arrived in the dreaded room 200, said by Andrea to be right above the lobby, and it was readily apparent that the following were issues:\n\nA. The carpeted floor beneath the huge air conditioner vent in the ceiling was soaking wet due to condensation dripping constantly.  \n\nB. The tub had a very slow drain, as my wife unfortunately found out during a shower.\n\nC. When attempting to call to report this, the phone was apparently disconnected.\n\nD. There was no hair dryer.\n\nE. There was no coffee pot.\n\nF. The room did not feel entirely secure.\n\n3. I immediately went downstairs and informed Andrea that the room was substandard and that we needed another room.  A couple of her friends/co-workers were also at the counter and overheard me saying this.  One of them said, \""Sounds like room 200 again.\"", which indicated to me that the room was known to be a substandard room.  Andrea gave me my new room key cards to 202, with nary a word of apology or empathy.  Again, I felt like I was infringing on her time.  \n\n4. At 5 am the following morning, we received a wake up call that we did NOT request (I informed the male desk staff at breakfast the following morning about this and to make sure we did not receive another one the next morning).\n\n5. Breakfast was substandard.  The hard-boiled eggs were substandard and old, the milk for cereal was warm, and the entire breakfast area was a mess (dirty tables, crumbs on the counter and tables).  \n\n6. After coming back to the hotel from a jaunt to downtown Charlotte, we discovered our key cards did not work to room 202.  We both went to the front desk and found Andrea working, so we told her the key cards no longer worked.  Again, with no kind of apologetic response or empathy, she simply re-keyed our cards and slid them back on the counter to us.  She clearly did not care.  \n\n7.  Yes, I am actually up to seven.  At the time we came down to get our key cards re-keyed, there was another lodger there who was clearly waiting in line for a while.  The male staffer was also there with Andrea and finally the lodger said, \""Excuse me.  I still haven't received room service\"" (which indicated that this was an ongoing issue with her), to which he responded very casually with no sense of concern, \""Yes, we know.\"" He went back to whatever it was that he was doing behind the desk.  That was then we dealt with Andrea and her incompetence or purposeful neglect at not keying our key cards.\n\n8. My wife happened to walk by room 200, which was open at the time, and discovered two disgruntled guests who were stunned at the room they were given.  My wife quickly summed up our experiences with them and they promptly went down to the front desk to demand another room.  Though they appeared to have gotten another room (or left), later in the evening we found a 'Do Not Disturb' card inserted in the top of the key card lock, indicating that this room had been rented out again.  Incredible.\n\n9. When we checked out, the male attendant from the previous day was there and arguing with a lodger, to whom he swore at on the phone.  \n\nThe overall feeling throughout this ordeal was that we were either dealing with a fantastically incompetent hotel staff or being targeted by them for whatever reason.  Also, we did not feel entirely safe in our room since previous treatment by the staff, particularly Andrea, suggested that she may have been capable of tipping off some undesirable elements of where we were staying so as to rob us.  This is not an exaggeration.\n\nSince this was our first time to this part of the country, we had no way of knowing that this experience was to be an awful one. Please learn from our experience and steer well clear of this place.  How anyone could willingly treat people like this in such a customer service position and clearly not be bothered by people's reactions to their callous, carefree demeanor is beyond me.  I will be seeking a full refund once I am done writing this much-needed review."
3,"I ate here with a group of friends from out of town on Saturday night.  The atmosphere was good and we sat at one of the larger round tables below a chandelier that looked like \""it could kill all of us at once\"", a friend noted.\n\nSince I was at an English pub, I selected the small order of Fish & Chips and I was fairly impressed by the size of the cod and the right amount of breading fried enough where it wasn't too greasy.  The fries or 'chips' were standard, but the fish was good and large enough for me to be happy.  I even took one of the large pieces home for the wife.  My friends got a myriad of things and they all had good things to say due to the large portions, especially the nachos.  Another English-fare eats include Bangers and Mash from what I remember.  \n\nAfter dinner, we went to the rooftop and had a drink or two.  It was a nice night for it, and the lighting was good and we had a friendly server upstairs who offered a sample of beer that we weren't familiar with.  I would come back if I was in the mood for English food and rooftop scene in Fort Mill."
4,"My wife is Japanese and -- after visiting the few that exist -- this is the only Japanese market she'll go to in Metro Phoenix.\n\nNew Tokyo Food Market needs a new name probably (wife thinks calling a Japanese market \""New Tokyo\"" is lame sauce), but inside... it's the real deal. Good selection and friendly staff.\n\nCareful though before making the trip: closed on Tues and Weds."
0,"I had a lot of hit and misses at this location but since it was the one closest to my house, I go here every so often ( not as often since the one time they gave me raw chicken )\n\nThe stars are base on the raw chicken and the service because let's face it, this is a chain restaurant so basically it should taste the same everywhere just different people making it and different attitudes. \n\nMy sister and I love Chipotle and and we went through our phase of wanting/eating it everyday. One hot afternoon we came in to get our usual the chicken bowl and when we went to eat it, the chicken just feels off. Then I looked down and to my surprise the chicken still had blood on it. We contemplated on telling someone because we don't really like complaining about our food. But we ended up doing it and the response we got was off. \n\nThe guy who looked like a manager or something said that he will replace this 'on the house' and that our meal 'will be free' which makes no sense because we already paid for them ???  Then the girl who was working was really defensive and went to tell us she don't think it was raw and that she took the temperature and everything. She didn't get to look at the bowls before he threw them away in the trash but is she trying to imply that we were lying? He obviously saw and apologize so what's her deal? Anyways after we got our new replacement bowls, we barely ate it because the thought of raw chicken just freaks me out and ruined my appetite. \n\nIt's been a few months since the incident and I would not go back to this location if I had a choice but it's extremely close to my house. \n\nThat last few times I've been here, the employees do skimp on ingredients and when you ask for more, I feel like I get attitude. Even when theres no line, I feel rushed. I like extra pico and lettuce ... What can I say but they just dump it on and push you forward. Like it's a sin to ask for more lettuce. \n\nAnyways I still love chipotle just not this location."
4,"In meiner Karlsruher Zeit war ich regelm\u00e4\u00dfig im Vogel. Im Sommer konnte man nett draussen sitzen uns sonst halt drinnen. \nNeben dem unfiltrierten Pils, was es immer hat, gibt es monatlich eine Spezialit\u00e4t. Mein absoluter Spitzenreiter ist der Weizenbierdoppelbock. Total orange Farbe, extrem s\u00fcffig. Zu reinlegen. Aber mit ordentlich Umdrehungen. Gl\u00fccklicherweise hatte ich in Laufweite gewohnt :) Aber auch die Straba ist vom Vogel nicht weit.\nBeim Essen sind mir die K\u00e4ssp\u00e4tzle und die Panini in Erinnerung geblieben.\n\n\n Warnung: auf dem Bier zum Mitnehmen (wiederbef\u00fcllbare Kr\u00fcge) steht, dass das Bier im K\u00fchlschrank bis zu sieben Tage halten w\u00fcrde. Das ist eine glatte L\u00fcge. L\u00e4nger als zwei Tage hat es nicht gehalten. Dann war es einfach ausgetrunken.\n\n\n Hach, wenn ich das so schreibe, sollte ich mal wieder eine Nacht in Karlsruhe einplanen :-)"
4,"Attended a Wine and Design painting session today at Piggly's BBQ and Grill. I am not an artist or painter and was nervous. Ended up having a blast and really like the way my painting turned out. Going again this Tuesday, looking forward to another great time!  If you're looking for a fun time, I would definitely suggest checking out Wine and Design!"
2,"I'm really torn about this review. On one hand, the food our party of 8 got at Fiamma was delicious but on the other hand, the service was so bad it almost ruined our dinner completely. Despite the quality of the food I probably wouldn't rush to return to Fiamma. There are just way too  many good places to eat in Vegas to repeat this place."
0,"My daughter did a trial class and loved it.  We signed her up and she went to one class and then got scared for some reason and would not go back.  I understand they do not do refunds, but I just wanted to talk to someone about getting a partial refund or credit for my other daughter to do a class.  Even if they didn't let me get a refund or credit, I just wanted to hear from them.  I left 2 messages with people and 3 messages on their machine.  NO RESPONSE EVER.  Just call me please and let   me know either way."
3,"We like it here.  The two of us went in today for lunch and there was a short wait (15 minutes) so we decided to grab our drinks at the bar while we waited.  The Bartender was visually a bit flustered as there were three unsavory looking and sounding women seemingly trying his patience with their drinks and menu ordering.\n\nWhen her got to use I ordered a Cadillac Margarita on the Rocks in the Big glass and he got a tall Spotted Cow on tap.  I continued to be friendly to the Bartender as I know the type and he was tipped $3 for the drinks.  While we got down off our bar stools he did say 'thank you, enjoy your meals.'\n\nOur waitress was Tasha and she was very pleasant; we ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and chatted in between watching basketball and Men's gymnastics on one of their many TV's.   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the works (hold the cheese) and he ordered two (2) trios; one for now and one for later.\n\nThe food was good, but the fries were sparse and non-crispy while they were seasoned OK.  He had another Spotted Cow and we cashed out.\n\nAll in all another nice afternoon at Applebee's."
1,"Went for the first time this evening. Cute place with a nice, clean cozy atmosphere. Friendly staff, but not overly helpful. The cheesy garlic bread was incredible - YUMM! My only complaint is the actual pizza. We got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard. The pizza sauce is also way too sweet. It tasted more like a dessert some bites. They put so much sauce on the pizza that you can't get around tasting the sweetness (underneath and on top of the actual toppings). Too sweet for me, but maybe you're into that? Decent price ($30 for three, all got sodas, medium pizza and app to share).\n\nOverall I wouldn't go again, but would recommend to someone who likes sweet saucy pizza."
3,"Went here for dinner on 11/15.  We were tired of all of the high end/fine dining and just wanted some decent good eats.  Since we were familiar to this place, we decided it was a no brainer.  \nAmbience:  Chill.  Think Cheesecake Factory (sister property).  Not romantic, not too formal.  But still nice\nService:  Very good.  Water and order taken right away.  Food did not take long to come out.  \nFood:  Menu was not as crazy big as Cheesecake.  But some very unique items.  I opted for the buffalo wing egg rolls.  Very tasty.  I then got the short rib grilled cheese.  IT was really really good.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  Secondly, the arugula was a nice touch in the grill cheese.  I would definitely order it again.  My friends got the shrimp jambalaya.  It was a tad on the dry side, but they whipped up some extra sauce.  Flavor was good.  Not too spicy.  I would order that again too.  We got the butter cake to share.  It was really good.  Almost as good as Maestro's buttercake.\nValue:  Compared to the prices in vegas, this is def a value.  Food prices range from $13-40 per entree."
3,"This place makes me happy. It's not perfect. There is a wide range of instructors, some not so good. It's been known to smell like a sweaty sock that has been worn over and over again and never washed. I'm not just talking about the heated studios, this goes for the showers/locker rooms as well. But if you can weed out the less than desirable teachers and learn to embrace the smell as the aroma of positive physical and mental change then this place will make you happy too. \n\nThere is a wide array of classes ranging from beginner to advanced and from varying lengths of time from 60 minutes to 2 hours. The temperature for the different classes ranges from 95 degrees to 105 degrees. In addition to Yoga and Pilates they have started offering Zumba again on Monday and Wednesday. I haven't tried the Zumba yet but I've only been taking classes for just under 2 weeks. Classes start at 5:30 am through the week and 7:00 am on the weekends. The last class of the day starts anywhere from 7:00 pm to 9:30 pm depending on the day of the week.\n\nI purchased a groupon for 30 days of unlimited classes for $30. They also offer a one hour \""new client tour\"" everyday. Taking this tour will get you a free week of classes so you can try it out before you commit to a membership. I have taken the Venus 60 minute class in 105 degrees with 40% humidity  6 times. I can already tell a big difference in my poses and flexibility and I am no newbie. I have been practicing yoga for 3 years, just not in this type of heated environment. The heat really helps to loosen up the body and take the full expression of the poses. I took my first 60 minutes Pilates class in 100 degree heat yesterday and I can tell you that as I sit here, sedentary at my desk, typing this review, I can feel the effects. Today will be a good day for a break. Challenge yourself. Namaste."
4,"Came as part of a V-VIP entourage. FUCKING AWESOME. We thought it was a little bit more fun than XS, but just as nice. The waterfall was beautiful. After all the bottles of Belvy and Ace of Spades, I nearly wanted to jump in to the pool.\n\nThe hosts as usual took care of us 110% and I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a high class place to relax and kick back. Best of all, our host kept bringing more and more fine ladies to our table. Our bodyguard actually had to kick a few out for getting in the way of our own dancing.\n\nI cannot comment on the GA because we rolled up with a group of 7 guys and had absolutely no problem entering. Probably not a normal experience.\n\nI forgot to mention I took shots of Patron with Too Short! Only in vegas"
2,"Reviewed as one of the best burgers in Pitt and a popular spot among many CMU students, if you have a car of course. Parking is horrendous around here, so it might be better to take the bus anyways and do a bit of walking.\n\nAfter hearing so much about it, my friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday. Did it meet all the hype? Not so sure. The burgers good, but it wasn't anything spectacular as I thought it would be. Honestly, I like Burgatory a lot better. I ordered the Bacon Bleu Cheeseburger with dry bleu cheese. Probably mistake on my part. I thought the dry bleu cheese would be more crumbly and less creamy, but the heat of the burger melted it and it became creamy anyways (I dislike creamy things in general). Didn't enjoy the burger half as much because of that, but again mistake on my part. The home fries that came with it could have used some more seasoning, but with lots of ketchup it was tasty enough.\n\nThe service was up to par. I came with a huge party and they seated us and took our orders with no problem. They even stuck a candle into my friend's burger for her birthday. Overall, I'd give this place a 3.5 stars."
2,"Rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable but keep in mind they are only full size beds in double bed rooms.  They are very strict when it comes to access to the hotel rooms and they even patrol the hallways.  I saw a bunch of families here.  If you want a more adult crowd the Hard Rock / Palms might be good for you.\n\nI'd stay here again if the price is right.  If you are into the night life you are probably better staying at Caesar' for Pure, Venetian for Tao so it's easier to get in, go back to the hotel room for a break or just get back to the room."
0,"The crawfish wasn't very fresh.  Half of the crawfish in both of my orders were very mushy as if they were previously frozen or precooked the previous day or something.  The sauce in both orders were too sweet, lacking the Cajun flavor that I'm used to eating.  Our waiter recommended the Cajun calamari, but when it came out, there was no Cajun spice added to the dish at all. We informed our waiter that perhaps he placed the wrong order and he told us he would check with the kitchen staff.  We never saw him after that, and we were still charged for the dish.  Overall, I feel that the crawfish was not up to standard, and the staff didn't seem to care.  I'm not sure why the Food Network featured this restaurant."
0,I Would never recommend this place to my worst enemy! \nManagement & staff are very rude & unprofessional\nThey protect their friends living here not the rest! I felt discriminated against & was told I could leave & agree wouldn't make me pay for the lease breakage she basically told me to get out because I reported noise even tho the lease says that we shouldn't be noisy!  Etc worst experience I've had ever!!!!
0,"I was having family come visit from out of state and ordered pizza on my way home from work. They said it would take 30 mins, and when I got there, they didn't even have an order put in for me. They kept insisting that I had called the wrong number and that my order was probably at another location. No. It wasn't. I called the same number that I called last time I placed an order here. I even confirmed the number that I called by looking at the number on their cards. I also asked her to look for my order using my phone number. She said she would and 5 minutes later, says she couldn't find it. HELLO?! You didn't even ask for my number!! The manager then comes up and says the phone number isn't even on the tickets, that they're by name. So why bother asking for a phone number anyway?  I mean seriously. After going through this whole ordeal, I ask the girl how long it would take if I made the order now. She said 10-15 mins.. 10 minutes later, she STILL hadn't put my order in. It's not hard, I just wanted a cheese and peperoni pizza. The manager offered me 50% off and I took it. I'm still not happy about it. A discount doesn't compensate for your incompetent workers who can't even put an order in. So here I am, still waiting for my pizza, and I'm furious to say the least. I will not be returning. Ever.\n\nBTW, I've been here for an hour waiting for two pizzas."
3,"At the urging of a friend we stopped in here Wednesday at about 2:30 PM. It is part of a small Gas Station Strip Mall. Very unassuming and quiet looking outside at the front. Walking in we could see a clean looking, open dining area, with a cheerful Hostess / Wait Person who greeted us and took us to a nice table.\n\nThe dining room is surprisingly big. It is open, clean, friendly, and has an almost cafeteria style design to it.\n\nGerman and American beers are available in big glasses so you can Gage the color. The heavy thick head on the cold German beer is inviting and the aroma is very full bodied. \n\nThe menu has a number of German style items to choose from along with a special available. There are Sausages (Wursts)  with very wonderful looking sides of pan fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, sauteed onions, sauerkraut, red cabbage, etc. There is also a sandwich board in the menu that looks like a fine way \""handle\"" your lunch. Then the menu describes some very flavorful sounding pork schnitzel platters and a pork or chicken cordon bleu\n\nThe menu touts  very nice Vegetarian selections both hot and cold. \n\nFinally, to insure that no one is left out there is a Kid's menu that allows them to also try these delights.\n\nWe opted for the Rollentini Special. Wonderful beef  roll up with spices and a pickle spear in the middle. There was a potato dumpling and red cabbage as sides. The rollentini and the dumpling came with an unbelievable tasty sauce that insured this presentation will be ordered by us again.\n\nWe finished our meal by splitting a piece of \""home made\"" cherry strudel that was so good be ordered another piece of cherry and a piece of apple to take home.\n\nBottom line: Clean, flavorful ethnic food, good service. We will be back soon."
4,"We had checked out a few restaurant supply stores for chefs jackets and hadn't found anything until we made our last stop at LVU for one last shot. Score! After figuring out how to get inside (we walked through an embroidery/seamstress shop) and were immediately greeted by a super friendly man standing just inside the store. He directed us to the chefs section which was amazingly huge, seriously they even had a chef jacket in my size! But get this, they had a humongous clearance rack where most of the jackets were under $10! It was a fuck yeah moment! The Mr got several jackets and I even got one for myself and you know what? I look super woofy in it too!"
3,A place worth trying. Had brunch there and the baked potatoes were very good. Gotta visit next time
4,"I visited Veneto Trattoria for the first time at lunch today.  What a pleasant surprise!  I love the cozy atmosphere of this quaint restaurant and the attentiveness of the wait staff.  Of course, the food was divine!  I highly recommend the salmon salad, if you're looking for lighter fare.  It was delicious - flavorful, moist and sized just right.  My co-worker was also impressed with his pasta dish.  I will definitely keep Veneto Trattoria in my Scottsdale rotation!"
3,Fast easy convenient and full of life!  The pizza is light and full of flavor.  I love the Kale and Quinoa salad.
2,"It's a Starbucks, what can I say.  The morning crew starts real early and has got their shit together.  They remember the regulars and their weird orders (I hate to admit it, but I am one of those, though I've seen a lady have her entire cup coated in caramel before having any coffee poured in, and they carried out her order, no questions asked).  They churn out drinks like no other, but it seems to be a thing at this Starbucks not to write your name down on the cup, so just listen out for your order cause things get a little crazy in the mornings.\n\nIn the afternoons, things are a lot quieter and service can be rather inconsistent.  I ordered a pastry once and stood there for the longest time as the girl who was supposed to get my pastry, took off her gloves, decided to take out the trash, stopped to talk to her coworker, before realizing I had been standing there the entire time, and finally asked if I needed help with something.  Yes, my order's on the screen, thank you very much.  But that was about the only bad experience I've had at this Starbucks.  Not counting the general nonchalant attitude of the afternoon crew, that is."
4,Delicious! And right across the street from my office! Cucumber Sake Drink!   Delish!
2,"If you're not going to eat pie here, there's no point in going. You can get a better lunch somewhere else. But the pie, oh the pie, is delicious. I had a grilled cheese sammie, and while it wasn't anything special, it certainly wasn't bad, and hit the spot after a morning of mountain biking. The other lunches in my party were similar - just ok. The service was a bit slow, but friendly. It's a good thing that pie comes at the end of the meal, so that you leave on a good note. It's a fun restaurant."
3,"If you have a hankering for a taste of New Mexico this place is the real deal.  I've been craving some carne adovada for some time now - a visit here satisfied that craving!  Good food, reasonable prices and well maintained.  I'll be back!"
2,"We arrived on a Saturday & they allowed us to check-in early. The receptionist acknowledged we were on our honeymoon, so she upgraded our room to a city view for free! She asked if we would like smoking or non-smoking room, and we adamently requested non-smoking.\n\nWhen we arrived to our room on a non-smoking floor, our room REEKED of smoke. We called the front desk - they said they'd send an \""air purifier\"" up to the room - but we'd have to leave for 2-3 hours. Fine with us, because we were on our way to the pool to spend $18 A PIECE on margaritas.\n\nWhen we returned over 3 hours later, we were locked out of our room (even the maid couldn't get in) and we could still hear the purifier running. When we finally tracked someone down to open the room, we were blasted with the scent of stale smoke... yes, it was actually worse when we walked back in.\n\nUpon calling the front desk, the man we talked to couldn't have cared less that we were having trouble with our room. He ended up switching our room to another - after we had already unpacked all of our clothes. He assured us our key cards would work.\n\nWhen we got to our new room (carrying all of our hanging clothes, 2 suitcases, etc.)... the key cards didn't work. We stood in the hallway for 15 minutes waiting for another employee to open the door.\n\nAll this, and we got absolutely nothing to compensate for our time/hassle switching rooms.\n\nThe hotel was nice, but the first day left a bad taste in our mouths. We won't return."
2,"This is decent tex-mex. I had the \""pacos taco's\"" and they were pretty good. Not a fan of the beans and I love beans. My margarita was ok but they are not generous with the tequila. We were there for lunch and it was not really busy. I could tell from the set up that they probably have a great happy hour."
1,"Yes, the Flamingo is in a great location.  However, the rooms, especially the furniture are OLD.  It really needs remodeling.  People were friendly.  However, the restaurants are poor.  We ate next door at the Paris twice during our stay and only ate breakfast (coffee and muffin) at the Flamingo.  No, I wouldn't stay there again.  When, I'm on vacation, I'd rather have a cleaner and nicer hotel."
3,"Went here with some local friends who are regulars at BJs.  I'd driven by it a hundred times and never gave it a second thought.  Looks like a typical dive bar from the outside.  Inside, though, was a pleasant surprise.  Open and comfortable, acceptable noise level, clean, and friendly.  Drinks were priced reasonably, and I believe there's a yelp check in deal.  We had a bunch of drinks, and I kinda dreaded the arrival of the bill, but I was again pleasantly surprised.  Probably less than 1/5 of what it would have cost us across the street at any MGM bar.  Good place to hang out for a little while and talk with friends."
0,"So after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore.  I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place."
1,I am a return customer and this place was very good a year or so ago. However this buffet has gone way down hill. The shysters charged an upcharge of $39.99 for a holiday brunch the day after the 4th of July (scam); since when is the 5th of July a holiday? Nonetheless I don't have a problem paying more if you get good quality food or something special for the upcharge. This was not the case and this was nothing less than a typical $19.99 strip buffet with Ikea furniture and a gelato bar.
2,"As long as you know what to expect from this place, you won't be disappointed. This is NOT one of those cushy, luxurious resort spas that you would find in many of the nicer strip hotels. If you are looking for the type of spa to really relax and spend the day in, this is not the spot for you. \n\nWhat you can expect is a fairly clean and newly updated facility that reminds me more of the locker room at my gym. There is a locker area, vanity room, waiting area, hot tub, sauna, steam room, and showers, that's about it. As for the amenities, again, this is more like a gym locker room than a spa. They have towels and the vanity area has a very basic selection of products (hair brushes, hairspray, gel, deodorant, mouthwash, body lotion) but they do not have other essentials like razors or plastic bags for your wet swimsuit. I had planned on spending a few hours in the spa but soon realized that there is just not enough to enjoy in this spa other than my treatment. The wet area has two lounge chairs which was sufficient since I was the only person in the spa on this particular day, which was mid-week, but I can imagine that if it was any busier you may not have any place to sit and relax other than the waiting area. \n\nAs for my treatment, it was amazing!!! I had a 50 minute Swedish massage and the therapist was great. It may have been one of the best massages I've ever had. My only complaint is that I didn't get the 80 minute massage; 50 minutes seems like a long time but it flies by when you are in bliss. Unfortunately, my BF also had the same massage but he was not as thrilled with his therapist. \n\nAll in all, this place is not bad if you are only concerned with your treatment. They have some great mid-week prices. I paid $90 ($108 including the mandatory 20% gratuity- they call it a service charge) for a 50 minute massage, which is about $30-$50 less than other spas on the strip. If you are looking for the complete spa experience I would fork out the extra money at one of the better hotels."
4,"This is my favorite LVAC because it's huge and I like the layout.  \n\nTrack, cardio machines and weight machines upstairs. More cardio machines downstairs, along with a huge free weight area, a pool and a women's gym.  They also offer lots of classes from body pump to pilates to water aerobics.\n\nIt's not super high-end or anything, but if you are looking for a good workout, this fits the bill.  I love the LifeTime Fitness on Sahara, but I'm honestly not able to spend 6 hours getting my hair done, massages, lunch, and a workout. \n\nLess strippers/meatheads than the 215/Flamingo location.  :)"
3,"Hello to All and welcome to my review of Carefree Resort.\n\nOk, so here it is..... This place is pretty terrific!  Especially for the $50.00 we paid!\n\nI saw a Groupon offering $49.00 room rate.\n\nSince I do NOT care for Groupon I contacted the hotel myself and got the same rate... if I am to be honest, they charged a dollar more $50.00! lol\n\nI was hoping since they didnt have to pay Groupon for our stay we might get the $10.00 \""Activity fee\"" waived....no such luck.\n\nThe reservation woman was super helpful.\n\nWe arrived and were delighted to see a sprawling well kept property.\n\nCheck in was easy and again the staff friendly and the valet parking was free.\n\nWe had requested a room close to the pool, but not so close that we had no privacy.\n\nWe were delighted to see a well furnished, LARGE room with pictures on the wall that told stories of the property since birth....I found this decor delightful!\n\nThe patio had nice chairs but unfortunately was staring right at the pool.... so much for privacy!  Although the room was well insulated therefore we heard no noise from outside.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and I am guessing , from previous reviews I had read, that these rooms have been updated.\n\nWe sat on our patio enjoying the scenary around us and it was clear everyone at the pool area was having a great time!\n\nLater in the evening we took a stroll down the lighted trails to a cactus garden area which boasted many different cacti and descriptions of each.\n\nThe birds were chirping and enjoying the plants as well.\n\nThe views as we walked were enchanting.  The mountains and sunset and desert life.... WOW.... it was very enjoyable!\n\nEven the soda machine was only .75 a can...I was impressed!\n\nLater that night we ordered room service... French Onion soup....YUK! No seasoning at all...just terrible and a turkey club which was good and fries which were terrible!  But then again... we didnt come for the room service and wont make that mistake again.\n\nWe enjoyed our romantic evening and being the early riser I  am, woke at 4:30am and sat on the patio enjoying the absolute silence other than the birds chirping\n\nAt this point I took advantage of the pool area.... ALL to myself!\n\nThe pool was great and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The jacuzzi was hot and bubbly and soothing and simply wonderful.\n\nCheck out was just as easy as check in.\n\nWe left Cave Creek with a warm fuzzy feeling knowing we will DEFINATELY be back!\n\nIn fact I shared our experience with friends and we are all planning a weekend there together.\n\nI am a firm believer that:\n\nIf I do not have a good experience I tell management, and if I do have a good experience.... I tell EVERYONE! ... In all fairness, if I am not happy... I write a review and tell everyone anyway....lol\n\nIt is my opinion that if you are looking to take a \""staycation\"" or just a night away...you should try CAREFREE RESORT.\n\nThey do have spa services and tennis courts and other amenities...however we were only there for 1 night and were unable to take advantage of these \""paid for-activity fee\"" services.\n\nIn conclusion....\n\nLive each day as though it were your last and ENJOY !"
2,"Great beer selection, pretty waitresses, very average food. Third time here and always have a good time. Fun isn't the issue. Food is. Had their beef rib. Was tasty but a little chewy and very fatty.....more than normal. Mac and cheese was very ordinary. Collards were really good though. Again the Gold Standard for BBQ in Charlotte is Midwood Smokehouse. Compare these 2 together and let me know which you like better. Macs rocks for beer selection and fun atmosphere. Midwood Smokehouse rocks for food."
1,"This place was an absolute disappointment. I was really looking forward to trying some wagyu, in all of its buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. However, I experienced a rather ordinary piece of meat, and it was definitely overcharred! I haven't had this problem before, and I really should have sent it back given its an $85 piece of meat.\n\nWe got the bone marrow and kobe sliders as appetizers. The bone marrow here is awful (at least, compared to CUT). No buttery richness at all, blah. The kobe sliders were good though, albeit a little small portion wise.\n\nThe duck fries and mac-n-cheese were both alright. Nothing special though.\n\nAtmosphere was a little too loud for my liking.\n\nReally this review should be 3 stars, but I was so let down that I am letting personal bias paired with an otherwise great vegas weekend make it two."
1,Nothing about the food is woth mention.  Good place for atmosphere not much else.  Grab your beer and paper hat and GTFO.
0,Customer service is non-existent. TINY PORTIONS and HIGH PRICES. I have been several times and they have yet to get my order right on the first attempt.
1,"We went there late Sunday. The food was good. Our server's name is LESLIE B. and she was awful!!  Took forever to come back for us to order. It was late, only two other tables were there. For like a whole 15 minutes we had no idea where she went. \n\nLater we asked if they do anything for birthdays, she told us about this dessert but seem very annoyed by it. \n\nWe asked for our CHECKS she brought one back. When we asked her to split it. She doesn't even remember what we ordered and made a face to us. \n\nThe food was good but the service SUCKED!! You would think they have better service when they want to charge you 200 for 2 a meal? Totally not worth the experience."
1,"Tried this place when it first opened in surprise not impress didn't come back ,then my boss told me to give it another chance it changed it been like 2 yrs give or take ,so we went back had good service went back again on a Sunday not busy took 30 min to meet the waitress to get drinks , waitress didn't even get told by the host staff we where hers. just very upset about this place they play it like it's the best thing on TV and it's suck at customer service now don't get me wrong once the waitress knew we where there she was on top of it she did a awesome job with what she could do between taking care of her customers and clean the tables she had cause they don't have bust boy/girls o well .that rant about the place ."
2,Great place for a busy and aged hotel; the nicest part is it's in open lobby with a waterfall and cute shops!
0,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I have been sitting here for over 20 minutes and have yet to be greeted. I finally went to the bar to place my order and there is one bartender and still no drink. The only reason why I've stuck around this long is because I found a charging station at my table. \n\nAs I'm typing this, the bartender approached my table aggressively and yelled, \""how dare you ask me to clean your table and not order a drink!\"" I said, \""excuse me? I ordered a Bloody Mary 20 minutes ago from you and you have yet to bring it to me.\"" He said, \""oh yah I forgot.\"" \n\nI have never been so offended by a Resturant/bar staff member in my life. Unbelievable! John Taffer from Bar Rescue would be falling over right now! \n\nNeedless to say, I got up and left."
1,"Java Coast Cafe is the kind of cafe you go to when you're in Vegas, and you're checking into Bally's, and you really want some expensive coffee to go with your future hangover (or current hangover).\n\nNot much to say here, it's a bit overpriced and the cups kind of suck, but it's all about location."
0,"bleh. i hate this place with a passion and avoid like the plague. i'm happy to pay marginally higher prices elsewhere to not have to set foot in this place. this particular location is slightly better than most i've seen, hence the 1 star but that's all it has going for it."
2,Pretty good for a decent price.  The rolled taco plate was the special and it was only $4.50.  They came with a topping of quacamole and cheese and they were quite good.  The quesadilla my daughter had was huge and full of nicely melted cheese.  She loved it but then you really can't go too wrong with a quesadilla.  The place was fairly busy with about 5 tables occupied.  It could have been just a bit cleaner in terms of the floor and tables but it was not bad.  They may have just had a rush and not had the chance to come out and clean.  I'll give them benifit of the doubt on that one.  \n\nI will go back and try more items on the menu.  They have specials every day and a fairly vaired menu.  It's located in a strip mall next to Starbucks and just down the way is Angel Sweet for dessert.  Overall it was decent.
3,Pizza and salads very good as well as the pookie. Only complaint is a few of the staff are pretty rude not very customer friendly. I'm still a believer in telling a customer thank you and some response.
1,"A self cook steak house, the meats are good. The idea of cooking your own meet is interesting, no one to blame if you overcook.\nThe salad bar that comes with the steak is from hunger. The sea food meat alternative is less than great.\nExpect to pay about $80 to 100 for a dinner for two with wine. the atmosphere is drab, too dark to my taste with little or no character. this place begs the question why not stay home and cook the steak for a fraction of the cost?"
1,"I am still a newbie when it comes to eating Thai food.  I tend to not venture to far from Tom Kha or your basic bbq thai.  I had a Restaurant.com coupon for Pho Hue Thai, so I took a friend and checked it out.\n\nWe ordered the Tom Kha first but it arrived last.  It was as I expected but the chicken was chewy like rubber.  It tasted fine but the texture threw me off quite a bit.\n\nWe also ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and Ginger Beef plates.  The beef was excellent but the chicken was not what I expected.  I've had Lemongrass chicken before and the taste was more like a curry flavor than lemongrass.  Perhaps it was my lack of understanding in what this type of Thai food was; if so I will have to educate myself further.\n\nThe prices were not too high and the selection overall was very good.  The sandwiches I was told are excellent and great for lunch (it is close to work, so I may have to go back).  The location is kind of hard to find in the three story shopping center on Spring Mountain (its in the far Southwest corner of the building on the second floor.  The electronic sliding doors to the restaurant are a weird but nice touch (don't have to get any germs by grabbing the door).\n\nI may go here again with another coupon but would not recommend going here otherwise."
1,"I'm rather confused about the reviews that this place has received. I went here for lunch today. We were the first ones there at 11:30 and while we were there, only three tables were occupied. I really cant see any justification for the horrible service....I'll get into that more in the review. \n\nThe restaurant itself is the typical strip mall restaurant setup. I liked the booths. The seats were like large boxes without backs. There wasn't anyone sitting behind us but can imagine that some might be uncomfortable with that when it's busy...your back would be literally against the back of the person sitting behind you. I'm a social person so think that it has potential and is an interesting way to provide seating. \n\nThe sushi wasn't bad....but wasn't anything to write home about either. It was a bit more expensive than it should have been. An iced tea, edemame, eel roll, and 1 piece maguro/ 1piece ebi ran me 18 bucks. I really wouldn't have minded if the service was good or if it was exceptional in the form of food presentation. Everything was mediocre at best. \n\nThe people I was with ordered from the lunch menu. They seemed to be quite happy with the quality and quantity of food. They each spent about 8 bucks. The egg drop soup was kind of bland according to one. \n\nWe all agreed on the service though. We had to ask for things multiple times, we were left alone with empty glasses, when our food came we were pretty much left alone, and we ended up sitting around for 10 minutes after we finished eating (staring at the waitress trying to get her to come over) before we had to go and ask for the check from the guy at the register. Our waitress was sitting at a table eating. Again, there were only 3 tables occupied and it was when they first opened. There is no excuse for the horrible service. I'm pretty understanding when it comes to justified bad service - I used to be a waiter. I understand that when things are crazy and chaotic, that service can suffer...and understandably. However, there is no excuse for how we were treated...or not treated as the case may be. I wont be going back to this place. If I do, it will be for carry out. It's been a long time since I've left anything less than 20% for a tip. The service dragged this rating down.\n\nSo, pretty much: Don't get the Sushi, Order from the lunch or dinner special menu, Don't eat in."
4,I love this place. Everything I have ever had here is yummy! Not once has my order been wrong. Plus the $5 for 5 tacos is great!
0,"Horrible! I went with Prism because the price was good and I was looking forward to the DSL option, as well as all the kid HD options. After about a month it all went down hill.  I left Cox because I was constantly having to reset my router.  The install guy told me I will never have to reset anything with Prism. YAH, right! I'm constantly dealing with freezing, I can't have three tv's on HD channels because one of them will tell me unable to use HD and tells me to shut off a service.  Now, I'm experiencing the sound cutting out about every 30 seconds.  \n\nLike others I was quoted one price when I signed up and when I received my first bill it was twice as much. I had to call several times for the bonus gift card I was supposed to receive.\n\nThe only positive customer service experience I've had was with the Facebook coordinator who actually took the time to help me, once I complained on Facebook.  The phone service people don't know how to fix anything. I called with a sound issue one day and all he could suggest was to unplug the box and plug it back in. I ended up fixing it myself.\n\nI can't wait for my contract to be up so I can go back to Cox."
2,"A nice dependable alternative to the ubiquitous chains that dot the PHX landscape.  Service varies on day and location.  I find the Central Ave. restaurant to be the better of the few in the area, plus it's around the corner from my place. The decor is a bit suburban-Midwest soccer mom, but the food is solid.  I usually get the Monterey, Bacado or Old Pueblo skillet.  A neighborhood joint - you're more likely to see gay singles on weekends than the seniors."
4,"If you are like me, and adore espresso martini's, you must check out Soba on Ellsworth Avenue! The martini is made of chilled espresso, vanilla vodka and Kahlua coffee liqueur. \n\nBy far the best espresso martini in the city!\n\nThey also have an excellent food menu for both the bar and restaurant.  They have happy hour specials and the bar is always filled with a great crowd!\n\nSoba is affiliated with the Big Burrito chain, along with Eleven, Kaya, Casbah and Umi: all of which are excellent restaurants!"
3,"Hello!\n\nI work pretty close to Whole Foods so I frequent it about 3-4 times a week for lunch. If you're there M-F between 12-1, you can find me in the salad/bread area (on the north end). \n\nCompared to other Whole Foods I've been to, I would actually rate it a 3 but considering I do not know of any other Whole Foods around, I thought it's my duty to those that do not know about Whole Foods a chance to give it a try. If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try. Plus their pre-made food is actually yummy.\n\nI'm able to keep my lunch on a budget by only buying lettuce and chicken from the salad bar (typically under 1/2 pound). I stash dressing, cranberries, and cheese in my office. I've tried buying the bag of pre-washed lettuce but I never finish them and I hate seeing them go bad. $3 lunches isn't bad at all.\n\nOther notes: The tofu chicken is really good (part of the salad bar)! It's not always available though. Also, none of their bread varieties impress me. I like their sushi rolls. If I could afford $8/day lunches, I'd probably have it everyday. I'd give their cashiers 5 stars. =)"
1,"The place is decorated nicely, the hibiscus iced tea is wonderful and the wait staff are attentive and friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, the food is overpriced, the buns are really dry, and basically it felt like a pretentious version of Blu Burger Grille."
1,"Food is really average and bland, not what I was hoping for by any means. Weird place in general, not an atmosphere I enjoyed or wanted to come back to anytime soon."
4,"Bree is amazing!  She owns this place and she is not only extremely professional, but also very thorough.  She uses the best wax.  It is very high quality, very comfortable on your skin, and virtually painless.  Bree is also amazing with eyebrows.  She created incredible arches and never makes brows too thin.  She believes in a very full brow.  This place is very clean and Bree is extremely nice.  I come back here every time I am in Vegas for an expert eyebrow shaping and brazilian waxing.  This place is great!!"
2,The Auld Dubliner is a quaint little pub at the beautiful Montelago Village.  The food and drinks are very comparable to Fado's in Henderson.  I'm not sure how well its going to fair with the closing of the casinos but I sure hope they find a place in the city if they can't make it out there being the Pub is awesome!!!
1,"I'm so done staying here.\nIt's not the rooms.. You get what you pay for with those. A comfortable (yet dated) place to sleep right on a great part of the strip.\nThe reason I am never coming back is because of constantly being bothered by the timeshare people (or whatever they are selling) who hit you up every single time you walk down the hall to Tower I or Tower II.\nI'm on vacation. I'm trying to relax. I don't need you to try and sell me stuff when I'm already staying here.\nSee ya, Excal!"
2,It is bar food but it's more of a sports sports themed Applebees. I'm not a really big fan but the service is pretty good.
4,"It's always like girl Christmas when shopping here. The employees are friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to advise on different looks. If you're a makeup buff, this is your happy place."
1,"I made a reservation a day in advance for brunch, this place was hard to find from the self park and i feel like i walked forever until we found it, upon arriving the hostess was not welcoming i told her i had a reservation (i will admit i was 15min late) and she checked her ipad and just blankly told me \""no i don't see your reservation\"". Another gentleman asked her what the wait was, she ignored him and told me again \""no you have no reservation here\"". I showed her my open table email and she looked at me like \""whatever\"". She was rude and had no customer service at all. We were seated and our waitress was nice, but the hostess ruined for me. Being a hostess myself i cant believe people like that are employed. Food was good but a little overpriced for just breakfast. There are better places on the strip skip this place."
4,"My bridal party and I went here for manicure/pedicures the day before my wedding, and we were all very happy with the service, staff, and price! Everyone's nails looked beautiful for the wedding and my pedicure is still going strong even a week later. The staff there were all very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended!"
1,"Pretty dead on a Wednesday night. Their chips are really good and will salvage a star. They charged 50 cents for a tiny tin of pico de gallo (\""the kitchen makes us charge for anything that comes out\"").  Tacos were nothing to write home about. La Condesa is similar concept but much better execution...and they love their grouponers...or at least they don't give people a hard time.  I paid $14 for two tacos with rice and beans. My LA friends would shoot me.  \n\nWe had trouble redeeming expired groupons. Waitress made it seem like she was doing us a favor to remove the paid value (3 whole dollars), which never expires and must be honored by the merchant per the fine print. They wouldn't let us subtract the paid value from a 2nd expired groupon ($3).  Anyone, please correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is that expired vouchers become treated like cash. Fine print says PROMOTIONAL value can't be combined with other offers, nothing about expired PAID values.  Manager (Missy) said she didn't have any written groupon contract in the restaurant (why not?) so I showed her the fine print on my phone.  Acknowledges what she reads but still insists the owner (who's not around, supposedly his name is Joe) says they can't do anything else. She said I can send him a message. I ask how do I do that if he's not here and she says \""on yelp\"" so here I am!\n\nIf you're going to partner with groupon, then honor the groupon rules...or have the rules on hand to show a customer he's wrong if he is misunderstanding something! \n\nMissy tried to make things right with a VIP voucher for future visits saying it was a better deal than the $3 groupon.  Actually, it's not because I'd have to buy two drinks and an entree to get a free entree instead of spending just $3 to get $10 worth of food. Regardless, it's the principle of the matter not a lousy $3. Just be happy we tipped well on the original bill. \n\nI hate when Yelp reviews become rants, but they must be done!"
1,I just don't get this place's success.  Bland food in a bland atmosphere.
3,"We literally went from airport to Pho So1, the parents came in from SF and I knew they would be hungry.  My man is on a \""eating healthy\"" kick so he knew my old Asian parents would be just fine with going there.  My dad and I were doing the Tom/Bo Nuong Vi ( shrimp/beef we grill at table and roll ourselves), my man had pho tai ( rare beef pho) and the kids all had pho with no meat.\n\nMy mom (being vietnamese/chinese) was SO picky cause you know how old school asian moms are- nothing is as good as theirs. So she finally settled on the banh xeo (crepe like thing with shrimp, bean sprouts, fried and served with herbs and nuoc mam).  I think she complained the whole time that it was a little hard- not as soft as how she's had it in SF...okay mom, but you finished the dish...so it wasn't that bad?\n\nMy dad and I thoroughly enjoyed our dish- with the shrimp paste dipping sauce.  I think that's the best part of the dish!!  Yes, yes, I am SO asian cause that dip makes you stink SO bad, but is oh SO good!  Anyhow, they bring out all the condiments to our dish- lettuce, assortment of herbs, rice paper and vermicelli noodles.  We grill up all the shrimp and beef and roll away...YUM! Word of advice, don't cook the beef too long or it becomes really tough..\n\nWe also ordered a beef carpaccio dish (Bo Tai Chanh) that was really good, the beef was so tender. \n\nThe place wasn't too busy when we arrived at 7:30pm but next thing you know, it filled up.  It seemed like a lot of people ordered the shrimp/beef dish that we had, but how can you not when first thing you see is people grilling meat at the table when you walk in?\n\nOverall it was a good night.  Service was decent, better then most Vietnamese places, all you had to do was wave to someone at the counter and they were right over.\nOh- and unlike some places on Spring Mountain, they DO take credit cards...I mean honestly I never have cash on me and its always a pain to stop and get cash..."
1,"Pretty darn bad food. Most of it was cold. Wokee express is much better.  Not recommended.  BTW... bring your jacket,  cold as a meat locker in here."
1,"May be a nice spot for happy hour, but I found it only adequate as a dining experience.\n\nMy steak was nothing special, cocktails were overpriced, bartender was grumpy, and I was disappointed they don't allow smoking in the bar.  Could be a 5-Star destination if they followed Ichabod's lead and designed a dining area that has a separate smoking section, allowing grown-ups to be grown-ups."
3,"I'm going to start with what is most important: The Booze.\nI ordered a easy drink to start with, a Manhattan, and I tell you what----Whoa! Talk about feeling all warm and fuzzy right from the start as I downed this delicious liquor filled drink. \nSo what I've learned about Merchant so far: They do not skimp on the liquor in your drinks. \nAsk for anything, they will have it. \nSo if you would like a great start of the night drink spot, I would suggest Merchant!\n\nAs for the food, I have briefly tasted appetizers and from what I've had---Great! Original taste and unique pairings.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is rather fun, sporting a wall of bottles of every type of booze you can think of. \nWait staff was awesome, and totally on their toes. What I enjoyed most was the fast that they brought water to the table in a fun chilled bottle and left it there as well. Very classy! \nI'll be back for sure!"
0,"My family and I have been seeing Dr. Traci Doan for the last 8 yrs and visits have always pleasant until today....she had different staff! I don't mind Ashley telling me procedures and charges BUT the hygienist, X-ray person and another woman in blue uniform.... WTF! 5 people had to tell me what needs to done! They were worst than salespeople pressuring me into buying a car....Dr. Doan and Kaitlyn are really nice but it's time to find a new dentist"
2,It is always fun but the comps are terrible.
1,"Arrving at Sky Harbor at 1AM was not the issue (it was empty), but my departure back home was almost a complete wreck.\n\nSo apparently this weekend, Nascar (among 1,000 other things) was in town.  I had a 12:40AM to ATL Monday morning.  Leaving Hohokam Park around 9PM (about 6-7 miles from SH), I didn't get to the f'n car rental center (a whole different story) until 10:30.  \n\nWho's genius idea was it to close the airport exit and re-direct traffic from a 4 lane to a one-lane bottleneck into the airport?  That could have been the dumbest, most inefficient thing I have seen since DC shut the interstate near RFK.  Traffic was unbelievable.  And I didn't realize it took another 15 minutes to get to the car rental \""center\"".\n\nAfter finally getting to the terminal, check in was slow, considering the amount of people they should have been expecting (they had red-eyes going to CHI, JFK, and ATL, amongst other places).  Getting to security was ridiculous- I would have rather gotten a handy from TSA then the circus they were running.  Apparently, waving my sunscreen in the air \""who's is this?\""  I should have told them it was my buttplug.   I told them, they said I could check it, but I couldn't let it go.  Cya, sunscreen.  \n\nAnother fascinating aspect was I had my cough syrup, hand sanitizer, and my lighter on me.  They could care less about the lighter.  The hand-gel - gone.  And my syrup, they made me take my stuff, and open it, they were testing it for God-only-knows. They didn't care about checking my ID to make sure the contents were mine though, just to make sure it wasn't on their list?  Is that not ass-backwards?\n\nFinally getting through, there wasn't shit open to eat or shop, a big no-no for people trying to get the hell home- I mean after taking 2 hours to go 6 miles that gets you hungry!\n\nThe actual airport itself was dated in some parts, but it was clean, its only saving grace.\n\nIMO, this place has a long ways to go to be a well oiled machine, which is a huge disappoinment being a gateway to the west."
3,"I have been here once upon a time & from what I recalled from my memory. It was pretty GREAT. \n\nVery pleased with the service & food.  The portion of the food was bigger than I imagined it to be & it sure did fill me up! One of these days, I'll come back to you, Archi's."
0,"Waiting is inevitable, I don't mind waiting 25min for a pedicure but these workers are so damn slow. Took double the time to get a pedicure as I would have anywhere else. And my feet are not disgusting that you need that much time to work on them, I get a pedicure at least every 3-4 wks. Also \""cut down your nails\"" means just that, trim my toenails. It does NOT mean cut so much I start to bleed. \n\nI will NEVER come here again."
4,"Nine out of Ten haunted houses are cheesy for adults. Nine out of ten haunted houses leave you laughing at the level of cheesiness. However, Monsterland is not nine out of ten haunted houses. Monsterland actually makes me squeal with haunted delight. \n\nThe Monsterland creators really put some serious time, thought and love into their haunted house or as they call it, the horror museum. Each room has a different theme from the history of haunts. It starts with early century haunting with themes such as Phantom of the Opera and Dracula and moves on through the haunt with themes like the mad scientist and plenty of ghosts, goblins and creeps. I like this haunt because it was created with such care that it doesn't look cheesy as you walk through. The rooms are constructed well, it's dark and dreary, the mechanics are par with a scene from a movie and yes, they even have props from famous horror movies! But for me, the actors really make Monsterland stand out from all the rest. They hired real actors to fright the crowd and trust me, it's impossible to know when a real life actor is going to jump out and scare you. They hide throughout the haunt and make it appear to be a prop but *BOO* it's actual and actor! \n\nThis is definitely a haunt worth checking out and I think old and young alike would like it. It's a great date night spots and worth taking kids too as long as they are old enough to realize it's all pretend. \n\nI can't wait to go back and visit the next phase when it turns into a horror museum that's open all year round!"
4,"Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.\n\nHubby and I decided to split the \""Pastrami Sandwich Combo\"" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the \""Zucchini\"" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. \n\nThey have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!"
4,"One of my favorite hotels ever. The rooms are so spacious, suite properties are always awesome, but the Venetian is comfortable, state of the art, and has such a spacious bathroom. I've stayed in a double queen and a king room. The king bed set is perfect. Just the right amount of pillows, and balance with the lighting. Ohhh I'm such a girl...I can go on...The pictures show it all....We have kids, so we make frequent request with extra towels, cribs etc...they come quick!\n\nThe only downside is that it takes a good minute to get to your room! Longgg walk....otherwise this is one of my fav hotels in Vegas!"
0,"If it was possible I'd give them half a star.. just because my Ice Vietnamese coffee w/ condensed milk tasted ok and my friend's taro tapioca drink was ok.\n\nWhere do I begin, there are soo many negatives that I can write a whole page about this place.  First of all, they were rude when taking our order.  We waved at 3 waiters  and each one told us to wait a minute.  Finally, a girl w/ glasses comes over and takes our order but in the middle of it she runs into the kitchen and does not come back until about a minute later.  RUDE!!\n\nThere are pictures of the food on the wall w/ #s next to them.  You would think that it corresponds to the # on the menu but NOPE.. its not even numbered the same as the menu.\n\nDO NOT ORDER WATERMELON TAPIOCA!  The picture on the wall look like the typical watermelon juice drink one would find at ANY tapioca drink place.  It should be RED... the ones that we got came out looking like blended pepto bismo!!!!  It was PINK... of course we complained and said it doesn't look like anything like that picture.  One guy comes over and said oh its because we use a powder!  So we refused the drink!\n\nWe ordered (2) #19 which was like pho tai w/ flanks.  One came out and I was still waiting for mine, so finally we got someone's attention and told him we're still missing another one of this (pointing at the first #19 we got).  They guy was like whats that, so I said #19, OMG-- they go and open the menu to see what it is and then goes to take the one that we have away.  We were like NO what are you doing!  We ordered 2 of this, leave this one and bring another.  \n\nI swear there are a bunch of morons working in this place!!!!  STRONGLY ADVISE PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY!!!   The food is not even good!!!!  Worst Pho EVER!!!!!  Paying at the cashier you can feel how sticky the floor was!!!"
2,"We went for the six tacos and six small beer special. We also ordered guacamole - which was made extra spicy for us. Great guac! When our beers arrived we were told they ran out of \""small beers\"" and gave us four large instead - that worked! When the tacos arrived we liked the carnitas the most and the chicken the least (a bit dry). The salsa was pretty good and complimented the guac big time. I liked that they gave us another basket of chips. I would give them four stars except the music was really awful: mash ups of classic rock songs with God-awful hip hop beats. BLASPHEMY!!!"
0,"The worst service ever! My drink didn't come until after I asked the waiter 3 times and he finally brought it after our food arrived! It wasn't even that busy. Food was amazing, but service makes or breaks a place. And this service was awful. When I needed something else, I just asked the maitre di."
4,"Truly great falafel has been sorely missing from Madison for a very long time. Places like Shish Cafe and Med Cafe offer up a pretty decent shawerma but the falafel around town has always been dry and oddly-flavored up until now. Banzo makes a falafel that rivals the stuff I have eaten in the Middle East, at prices that rival some parts the Middle East - particularly Israel, where one of the founders originates.\n\nThe authenticity does not stop at the falafel, either. Schnitzel is a staple of Israeli cuisine due to the Ashkenazi influence, while their \""mini-burgers\"" are blended with a truly Middle Eastern mix of spices, vegetables, and fat. I have no idea why they call them mini-burgers though, because they are undoubtedly the very same kofta meatballs I grew up eating in an Egyptian household.\n\nI just wish they would open on the weekend, because I've already suffered many a disappointing hangover wherein a juicy falafel sandwich would have been exactly what I needed.\n\nBanzo could also seriously benefit from taking a couple pages from Israel's own falafel enterprise: \n1. Add laffeh bread to your menu. Your pitas are excellent but I would more than willingly pay a slight upcharge for the \""Chipotle burrito\"" of falafel sandwiches.\n2. Give me the option to stuff chips (french fries) in my falafel.\n\nMy suggestions should in no way be taken as \""needs improvement,\"" though. There's no doubt in my mind that the Levantine style of falafel is the best in the world, and Banzo absolutely nailed it. The fact that they deliver makes this THE go-to place for delicious and even healthy fast food."
0,"By far the worst sushi I have ever had.\n\nIt took the waiter a full ten minutes to notice we were there even though we were in the very front and there was hardly anyone in the place.\nI was excited to get some tasty, tasty sushi but I was sorely disappointed when I got the menu and there were literally six items on the sushi menu. I should have cut my losses right then. \nI ordered a Rainbow Roll and some Yellowtail. The yellowtail was alright but I was disappointed there was no roe. The Rainbow Roll was terrible!!! I'm used to getting at least eight decent sized peices out of a roll and for there to be healthy chunks of albacore inside the roll. Not here. This $16 roll was five peaces and was filled with Krab and enough mayo to clog my arterties.\nI ended up eating most of the rolls because I was hungry but toward the end, I picked the actually fish off the top.\nWhen the waiter returned, he commented that I hadn't finished everything and asked if I was too full. I told him no I wasn't too full, I was just really disappointed in the dish. He laughed and said he would finish my food for me, dropped the check and was never seen again. \nYuck.\n\nHe gets one star for tracking us down when my boyfriend forgot his credit card."
0,"This is my very first 1 star review, but this place deserves it. Service was slow, we couldn't order appetizers because we were told they would take as long to cook as the main course (??), and they took almost 20 minutes to get a waiter to take our order. Other issues were flat soda, no ice, and a lack of butter for bread. \n\nFor making beer on the premises, the amber beer I ordered was, to be frank, not good. For the main course I ordered pork shank, which might as well been called pork fat shank, as there was more of it than the actual meat. Everyone's else's meals were lackluster as well. \n\nTo put it simply, we spoke to a local the next day who said we would have been better off eating at McDonald's. Enough said."
3,"Jan Rouven was great! I was a bit worried about what to expect since it was a show off the strip, but I would definitely recommend to friends and family. He is a bit more personal with the audience (looks for audience members to participate) which I think is great.\n\nThe only thing I found a little cheesy was him trying to sell his magic kit at the end of the show. I suppose that's how upcoming magicians start out? Regardless, after the show he met everyone in the front entry way to \""autograph\"" entry tickets or anything else which is very personable and warm.\n\nGo see him. Skip David Copperfield. I honestly hope he makes it big in Vegas. He's charming, handsome, funny, and very down to earth. He's certainly a rising star."
1,This is mediocre at best for dinner.  I have to assume the good reviews are based off a breakfast experience because our first time dinner experience was blah across the board. \nIt felt and tasted like an upscale cafeteria experience... not good.
4,The food was excellent. It far exceeded our expectations. The service was friendly and attentive. Recommend it for something different.
1,"Came in for lunch and stood by the waiting station for a long time...I went to the area where one can see me standing by to be seated.  Employees won't even give you a time of day to tell you that they will get someone to seat you!  Finally someone came in by the waiting station  and I scuffled on by to get her attention! She won't even look at me to tell me she was just checking in and that she will get someone to seat me....she had on her earplug and went on her merry way without acknowledging my presence!  I thought that was really odd for an employee to behave in nonchalant way!  The place is kind of outdated and needs new clean carpet! I have to admit though, that once they got me seated and told them I was on my lunch break, the server was very accommodating and friendly."
0,Save yourself money and time by going to the Rio instead. The Rio's about half the price and the line outside moves quicker. This buffet was a massive let down. I'm a local and brought my mom there for birthday. $32 per person is fine when the food is good. Not the case. Servers were great but nothing could save the food :(
1,"I'm surprised I didn't review this place earlier. My Vegas trip was early December and my bridesmaids and I chose this spot to come after our Chip and Dale's show to keep the party going.\n\nwhat a buzz kill. \n\nWe had reservations and they stuck us under a fan/vent/ i dont know what and it was so cold. They did try to change the temperature which was very accommodating of them but it didn't make a difference. They didn't offer to move us away from the vent. \n\nThe food was not good... like at all, I tried really hard to like this place because we were all in such high spirits but I could see how progressively we were just getting more tired of TAO \n\nI didn't have a drink but my bridesmaids weren't wowed (I mean for what your paying there, should you be?) and the food wasn't even half-way good.. the waiter got bombarded with large parties and it took forever to get out of there. \n\nAll in all I have to say as a New Yorker there are so many delicious options in terms of dining out no matter where you are (times square included) you could always find a reliable high rated yelp no matter your location but I noticed Las Vegas just plain sucks for dining out. \n\nMost yelp ratings for these places are all 3 star averages and Peppermill was not good it was just excess.. the only redeeming food establishment was the delicious Tacos el Gordo which deserves 5 + stars. \n\nSave your  money and go elsewhere TAO stinks. I've had better chinese take out."
0,"I would rent elsewhere. I got a package deal through Southwest, and I picked Dollar as it was the cheapest car rental. As the saying goes, you get what you paid for..they charged us taxes when we got to the desk, which was expected and reasonable (about $22 dollars for 4 days of car rental).\n\nHowever, what caused me to never rent from them again is their scare tactics. They try to sell you on extra insurance that is $30 a day, stating that Dollar will charge you $125 a day for up to 28 days when it is in the shop getting repaired for any damage that happens to your car. I told the guy that the car would mostly be in the hotel garage, when he promptly told me that most \""dings\"" that occur in Las Vegas occur in the garage (people hitting & running, and not leaving a note). He also mentioned that 40% of cars come back \""dinged\"" and have to go to the shop.\n\nTotal the extra insurance would be about $120 for the 4 day rental period, which would sky rocket my total rental car payment up to $250 for 4 days. Ridiculous. I ended up just leaving the car and not even renting it, as I ended up having a friend in town during my stay that had a car. I would have rather lost my initial $100 I paid for the car, than pay an extra $150 for taxes & \""extra insurance\"".\n\nOverall when speaking with the guy at Dollar, they just seemed untrustworthy. Don't exactly want to be renting a car from an untrustworthy company."
3,"We were introduced to this place by a good friend during my recent trip to Las Vegas. My friend was able to get my date and I into this place for free ($30 charge normally). Our reservation was scheduled for 7 PM so we arrived at approximately 30 minutes prior to our reservation. This allowed us to hit up the lounge arrange which arguably has the best view towards the Las Vegas strip. For the view alone and the pleasant lounge area, I'd strongly suggest you come here. The day after, my date and I went to Bubba Gumps on the strip. That is where I looked across towards the Mandalay Bay and realized how high this lounge area is. Amazing! \n\nNow, the decor inside was dark (intimate) but I'd say some of the interior furniture and decorations were outdated, thus the dark lighting? Not sure. The service was excellent. Our dinner started off with a complementary bread basket which I can always appreciate. I requested that bread be warmed up and the server complied with the request. My date's Martini was accidentally spilled, the server kindly brought out another Martini for us. Major points for that!\n\nFood: We started off with a Ahi Tuna Snap Pea Salad and an order of their Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes. Personally, not impressed with either dish. The server noted one of the specials of the night which was a 22 oz. Porterhouse steak which we ordered. but yet didn't realize that it was a $72 order once we received the bill. Being that the 16 oz. T-Bone steak was listed at $55, $72 doesn't sound so bad especially since my friend was able to get us a $100 gift card and a bottle of '09 CA Pinot Noir from Sonoma County which was totally was unexpected. Bonus for us. The sides we ordered along with the steak was the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese and the Grilled Asparagus which were excellent and strongly recommend. \n\nBeing that Vegas hotels nowadays charge for items such as internet access, club entry, gym and/or pool access, etc., with the view alone, $30 is entry fee is not such a bad deal. I'd say, if you've never been, go and at the very least, enjoy the fantastic and very unique view towards The Strip. $$$-$$$$ for food so be prepared."
3,"We visited while in town for work, and had a nice evening on the patio with some sangria (both white and red were yummy) and a couple of tapas. The servers were a tiny bit slow, but very nice. Overall a good visit!"
4,justin is the best server\nthey really sing for your birthday\njasmine is great\nthe parmesan wings are great\nthe steak sandwich\nthe roast beef\ncheesecake is wonderful
4,"I'm from CA and needed a stylist for my Vegas wedding. My sister-in-law found Amelia for my big day. Amelia offered very prompt responses to my e-mails and phone calls and was always make me feel secure while I worried about silly details. On the day of my wedding my alarm did not go off as it was supposed to at 5:30 AM, which ended up being alright because Amelia was 5 minutes early to our scheduled start at 5:45 AM. She was very positive, given the time of day and had all 6 of us ready to go ahead of schedule. My hair was exactly what I wanted and my makeup looked naturally beautiful. I felt exquisite on my wedding day, and my pictures turned out wonderfully. Amelia was awesome, I want an excuse to go back to Vegas just to have her do my hair and makeup again!!! Thank you so much Amelia, you made my day perfect."
4,"Great place for authentic Chinese food (Not P.F Chang style). The price of the food is affordable and the service is good. I seen reviews complaining about the service but it is what you will expect from a fast paced chinese restaurant \""Come, enjoy the food, be happy and get out\"". They are always busy and people are waiting at the door to get a table."
4,Food was great. They know how to cook a steak! Great views of the Bellagio fountains. Exceptional service.
4,"Our cousin took us here as this place is one of her favorites. My husband and I have never had tapas before and it was our first! We got about 7 different tapas, white sangria and churros (laugh now but they were sooooooo good!!) Our server was very attentive and friendly. Some of the tapas we got were the dates, short ribs, duck confit, beef tartar, yellowfin tuna, just to name a few. Our favorite was were the dates tapas and the beef tartar tapas. The white sangria was really really good and would recommend it! My husband even enjoyed it and he isn't one for those \""fruity\"" drinks. It is a little pricey but well worth the tastes and flavors!"
1,"My review is only for the nightclub and reads like the musical experience there. \n\nIf my group hadn't thrown down for bottle service ---LET ME HEAR ALL YOU OUT OF STATERS ---there is no doubt this place ---- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, UUUUUGH ----would have gotten one star ---RIP MICHAEL JACKSON---. It was really crowded ---PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU WERE BORN IN THE 70S OR 80S-----and the dance floor is really ---WHO'S FROM CALIFORNIA-----small. \n\nThe DJ spinning the night we went was horrific, but he seems to love to hear himself talk and somehow he thinks he's \""world renowned\"". For the entire night, there wasn't one song he didn't interrupt. There are some songs that just shouldn't be messed with or interrupted but he couldn't make it 45 seconds without hollering. It messed up the groove and wrecked songs. \n\nLuckily nothing can get a bachelorette party down."
2,This place is ok but not the best. Purchased a gyro platter and again...it was ok. Wasn't to thrilled that the sauce was already spread all over the gyro and rice. I prefer to have the sauce on the side. I felt like the rice was prepared early in the day and not freshly made. The gyro itself was ok but not a lot of flavor. \n\nGood customer service and very friendly! I guess I'll give it another shot and order something else on the menu.
1,"Okay I stopped by here this morning with well over an hour before my flight and got to the terminal just minutes after the door was already closed. \n\nTwo hostesses this... One named Monique I believe. Both had attitudes with the customers and their coworkers. \n\nIt took forever to get service and I got up to leave... Then the server rushed over like a police dog. I ordered a simple breakfast... The cook brought that out in only a few minutes. The server brought my orange juice about 12 minutes later. \n\nWhile eating, a guy (20's?) shows up with two girls and Monique is no place to be found. Next thing I notice is him feverishly picking his nose and 'flinging' the 'catch of the day' out onto the restaurant floor as well as at passing by travelers. Now that's class!! The girls with him were not phased by the incident. \n\nThe food I ordered tasted ok... Much like Waffle House except higher priced. It was next to impossible for me to find the server for the check. Monique was out if range as well. \n\nBy the time I was able to chase this lunatic down and pay for my food I was late for the plane. Thankfully a little information got me on the plane. \n\nWon't be going back to this place!"
2,"Last night was our Anniversary and Indian is our favorite so on a strong recommendation from a co worked we celebrated here. \nThe place is big and nice inside and it was very clean. It was 8:30 when we arrived so the buffet was pretty empty so we just ordered off the menu. we both got Indian beers and they came in frosty mugs so we loved that. we ordered veggie samosa and they were straight off the buffet so they were heat lamp warm, disappointing since we ordered them off the menu we figured the would be hot and fresh. I ordered the vegetarian dinner with paneer tikka masala, the paneer had been sitting in the sauce a long time as it was orange all the way through and was as chewy as a rubber ball, didn't eat it. the rest of the meal was good but the temp of everything was like it had come off the buffet, we also like our Indian HOT so we ordered accordingly and there was NO heat in anything we got so they brought us some hot sauce to add to it and that was super mild as well :( my dinner also came with dessert and coffee or tea I ordered tea but it never came and my dessert again was brought off the buffet.  Our bill came to $51 +tip so kinda pricey but we did have a beer each.\nThere was a strong language barrier between us and the waiter we kinda felt like we were on a customer service call and we had been patched over to Indian and couldn't quite get on the same page. the rest of the people that worked there were nice and helpful but I don't think we will make the drive out again as we live in Arrowhead ."
4,"Who writes a review for a chain? A person who's gone to the same store for four years, that's who! Take a hip coffee place, throw a bunch of Starbucks logos everywhere, and you have this amazingly friendly coffee house. I was anti-Starbucks but now I won't go anywhere else. The staff is friendly, fast, smart, and they don't change every month. \n\nThe outside sitting area is really nice and cozy. They have tons of seating and misters/shade for the hot summers."
0,"Mark has stated in the comments that he both tried to fix my hair and give me my money back. Both are true, but I would not allow either. If you go here, and he jacks your fade up, he will offer to both fix and/or refund your money. But its kind of like being dropped off by a cab downtown. When you hop out of that cab, the cabbie runs you over. Do you want him to throw it in reverse and backup or just leave it as it is? And when its over, are you really worried about the $19.95 that you paid to get there in the first place? Probably not.\n\nRead his comment one more time ... according to him, I apparently have a \""corner\"" on my round head. That might mean you have one too! Enough said."
3,"I used to eat here as a child but lost touch with the location for about ten years.  I vaguely remembered a dish that I ordered as a kid at \""some Mediterranean restaurant\"" and asked my father about it.  He told me to head to Paymon's and I did, ordering the pomegranate fesenjan and turkish coffee just as we used to.  And...it lived up to my childhood memories.  Once again, I am addicted to fesenjan.  Good for the soul, bad for my budget."
4,Everything was great!
1,"Great for a cheap meal... because the service is so bad, you'll never have to tip!  Food is good, diner is a bit dated (read: dingy), but I've never had such HORRIBLE service.  Waitress took our order and never came back, then gave me attitude when I went to find her and ask for drink refills.  Even with good food... why go back?"
3,"Fat Heads has almost become a Pittsburgh staple. Before I moved here I remember people telling me I must check it out.\n\nThe place is always crowded, so make sure you are prepared to have a beer from their awesome huge selection of beers while you wait to be seated. If you don't want to wait try them out at lunch or early evening. \n\nThe portions of food are huge. I normally go into this meal either really hungry or prepared to share. Service was pretty decent too."
4,Seriously?!\n\nSo. Amazing. \n\nEnough said.
1,it's an okay starbucks. they didn't accept my card so i wasn't able to take advantage of the discounts.
3,wonderful little cafe! the food was plentiful and really good. The staff was friendly and efficient!!  will go there often!
1,"With killer DJs, a sexy atmosphere, funny, friendly doormen and a positive vibe, you would think I'd be giving the Marquee a stellar review. Although these things are very important in a good nightclub, here's what made my recent visit to the Marquee a two-star experience:\n\n1. The feeling of constantly being herded like cattle. Ladies and gents, be warned. If you're not signing up to drop several bills on bottle service, your options of where you're \""allowed\"" to be drop significantly. I was at the club with four other girls celebrating my friend's upcoming wedding, and it seemed like if we weren't in line to buy drinks or in the main dance pit, we couldn't be anywhere else. At one point, three of us were on the second floor on a balcony overlooking the main DJ area. A few minutes later, I felt a tap on my shoulder and much to my surprise there was one of the staff members shining his little flashlight on the floor directing us to leave. Really? Why? It's not like we were intruding on a VIP area or blocking a walkway. Being the pacifist that I am, I complied, but I have to admit I was very confused. An hour later, we were invited to someone's bottle-service table, and even though we were within the seating area and not at all in the walkway, a staffer was telling us that we had to move in even further. Very weird, and although I understand in a place as packed as the Marquee they need to be strict with safety measures, it felt excessive.\n\n2. Drink prices. A few of the gals in our group decided to buy rounds of drinks for us, and for five, non-top-shelf drinks the bill was $70. REALLY? The only other place I've been with drinks that expensive is the Ministry of Sound in London, and the Marquee is nowhere as iconic as that. Ladies and gents, do yourselves a favour and get your pre-drink on.\n\n3. The layout. Given that at least half of the guests at the Marquee are ladies wearing (oftentimes) uncomfortable heels, I found the amount of stairs and slippery, sloped floors surprising. When it came time to leave, we had to make an epic trek down what looked to be an industrial staircase. Although my lady friends and I aren't sloppy drunks and therefore had no issues, it was painful for me to watch all the young ladies try to make their way downstairs in their sky-high heels on wobbly legs.\n\n4. The available dance space. I'll admit -I love to bust a move when a good tune comes on, but given the limited areas in which you're allowed to stand and dance, the only dancing I could do was an awkward jiggle which I now call the \""sausage dance\"" -because you feel like a sausage trapped in its casing.\n\nOverall, am I glad that I came to the Marquee? Yes, it was certainly an experience, but considering that I was part of a group of five intelligent, confident and beautiful ladies in their late-twenties, it felt strange to have our \""fun\"" dictated to us. The crowd was filled with young, just-turned-21 year olds all hooched up and getting sauced, which didn't bother me as it was what I expected -as should you."
3,"Went here for the first time. And loved it! My first thought was \""oh smack, ten dollar mimosas? That will be all up in my face\"" they were delicious. Ordered the hamsteak and eggs with biscuits and gravy. O. M. G. I didn't breathe while inhaling. So good. The gravy is top notch.  The man got chicken fried steak sandwich and loved it. Fries are super crispy and potatoes were perfectly seasoned. Cute little place off cactus. Don't go down rainbow though! Take buffalo to cactus. \n\nTen.  Dollar. Mimosas."
3,"Tuna tower, pork tenderloin, cucumber ahi salad, macadamia shrimp roll and yamada roll = $72.00\nThe place is clean dining area to kitchen and bathroom. Service is very fast and friendly.\nFood is spectacular! I really enjoyed the macadamia shrimp roll the most. The Tuna tower is quite filling as small as it looks. \nI didn't give them 5 stars because I think the food was overpriced by $5.00. The rolls had about 5 to 6 slices which to me by most other sushi spots would be considered a half roll. The pork tenderloin dish had about 6 or 7 slices of  pork tenderloin . A huge helping of mashed potatoes and sprinkle of bak Choy and shoe string potatoes. It was more potatoes than meat still everything on the plate was yummy! I didn't care too much for the sweet and spicy sauce on the yamada roll it overpowered everything else in the roll and it tasted like I was eating a lumpia. Overall the food, service and establishment is awesome. I don't think I'll be back though as the pricing isn't right enough to frequent."
3,"The Grand Lux Cafe at Palazzo is the easiest place to grab a good, quick bite.  The food is always good at both the Palazzo and Venetian and the Venetian location has the best steak and eggs in Vegas.\n\nI've had breakfast, burgers, pot roast, drinks and various appetizers and have never been disappointed.  \n\nMy blog has way more specifics, but the Grand Lux is great."
3,Love this place! my usual go to item is the pasta with vodkas sauce? i think thats what it is called! very nice employees! and i also like the pizza they serve. All pre made items.
1,"see this picture posted by another yelper: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA?select=nEEtzmZrXXFr-egtbVSF6A\nThat's the size portion I'm used to from Chino Bandido.  What we got last week was about 3/4 of that.  \n\n\nMy husband and I have been ordering the combo of jerk chicken, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice and black beans ever since this location opened in Chandler. And have always been satisfied.   \n\nI was so shocked at the portion that I asked the employees what happened.  Their explanation is that they \""have not downsized the portions, because the portions were being over-sized incorrectly before.   So, now the portions are the right size.\""  And looking through the other yelper photos, i see one from '08 that looks similar to (but still more than) the portions size we got last weekend.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA?select=kGQgU8IelC8DABJQSdIYoQ  So, oK, well, I can understand what the employee was talking about, but, it still is rather disappointing.   Considering that we've ordered the combo more times than I can count, and have never had the \""mini/correct\"" portion-size ever before until last weekend. \n\nThey also used to give my daughter a small cup of rice with a little bit of plain chicken.  this time, when I asked for a little kiddie cup, they gave me the same size cup, but it was empty...\n\nThe one thing they give generously still are those big huge sugar cookies.  Unfortunately, we can only ever finish half of those.  I'd rather get a free cup of rice for my daughter, than three big sugar cookies.  If ever we go back, i'll ask if they'll do that for me.  But, we're not likely to come back again even though we like the food, it's just not affordable for our family anymore.  One combo wouldn't even satisfy me as it is now.  For my husband and I, I'd say if we ordered three combo meals, that would be filling."
1,"The food is mediocre, but could be forgiven if the service was better.\n\nThe fries were so over salted I only ate about 2 or 3 before they were discarded. \n\nThe employees just don't seem to care! \n\nThe guy at the table next to us opened his burger to find everything but the beef! His burger was literally missing the beef patty!\nSerious lack of attention to detail here."
1,"Bahn mi inferior to Mr Sandwich in the next strip mall in basically every way, plus the place feels like a McDonald's inside."
2,Its a 7-11 has the basic amenities that most convenience stores have but its tucked into a strip mall parking lot and is facing away from the street making it a hard loop around a back side street to get in from one side and a short back track if you use the other direction.  The store has always been clean and the employees friendly. \n\nI've stopped in for a Slurpee after visiting my dry cleaners and will continue to do so as long as the temp is triple digits.
4,Love this place!!  Great food and atmosphere. Come out!!  A family owned function that deserves the support.
1,"Movie theatre=OK\n\nBuffet= OK\n\nVictory Cafe:\n\nAbsolutely the most horrible coffee and omelet that I have ever had in my entire life. Coffee should have been called coffee flavored water, weak and bitter tasting.\n\nEggs-grossly overcooked, and I am not one to return food to the kitchen so they can spit on it or something.\n\nSteak-according to my family members was tough and rubbery.\n\nHotcakes were very bland. How do you screw up hotcakes?\n\nVery disappointing, so I will wait on the buffet, which at least has options if something is terrible, for me to try something else."
1,"This location is always out of glazed donuts??? Then the girl gives me attitude.  Get a clue, you're a donut shop.  P.s you still have Halloween marketing signs on your counter too.  Obviously not very well run."
3,"I'm so lucky to have such an amazing sushi place so close to home. They have an all you can eat that is very reasonable and I always over do it. I just can't help myself, the food is so good!! Nice casual atmosphere."
2,"Solid,  that pretty much sums up this place.\n\nI got the new york (which is pretty much what i get at every steak place),  and it turned out pretty much how i would expect the average 50 dollar steak to taste like.  Good but not amazing.  \n\nThe service was also on par for this type of restaurant.  I actually came here twice and both times I had a good experience.   Which i guess in itself is quite the feat since it's pretty rare for me to visit one of these places more then once AND not be disappointed the second time around."
0,Where is the restaurant? It doesn't exist at the location shown.
0,"The resort is behind the Flamingo resort. The picture of the resort on their web page is deceiving. The pool is Flamingo they let Hilton guests use it. The music was very loud eventhough the property director insisted that noise is constantly monitor. Flamingo's pool close at 5 PM, Hilton's pool is very small. The location of the prperty is great. Beware of the garage, they again share the garage with Flamingo. The elevator location in the garage is located closed to Flamingo property than Hilton. You have to use the walkway from 3 level walk about 1000 feet then walk down the steps to get to Hilton. If you have a problem wirh the resort, don't bother to complaint. The resort director will casually brush off your concerns and cannot admit that there are rooms for improvement. If you like loud music and partying this resort is definitely yours."
4,"You should come here for the pizza, but if you don't get some homemade dessert...... you are missing out!"
3,"A group of us decided to book a table at Rascals after hearing positive things about the new place - and more specifically, the burgers! There was certainly plenty to choose from, ranging from the classic hamburger, all the way up to such delights at the 'Sir Alex Burger' (haggis, Jalapenos, cheese, whisky sauce) and 'Three Little Pigs' (cured ham, bacon, pulled pork - oink!). The waiter was very helpful with those of us who were a bit more indecisive and were able to make suggestions/substitutions for a couple of my veggie mates. \n\nI decided to opt for the 'Ranch Burger' (cheese, bbq sauce, onion rings) but substituted the bbq sauce for their special 'Rascals sauce' and while the actual beef burger itself wasn't the best I'd ever had, it was juicy and full of flavour, served in a soft brioche bun (I do love a brioche bun!) and loaded with crispy onion rings (which I had to remove in order to get my mouth around the thing!). However, the chips did leave a lot to be desired and I was eyeing up my pal's sweet potato fries with envy - and  they were lovely so get them instead, worth the extra \u00a31.50! I also had an oreo milkshake (all milkshakes are \u00a32.50 on Mondays, it would have been rude not too!), it was nice but a bit sickly. Although maybe I should have had it afterwards for dessert - or maybe I just shouldn't have been so greedy!\n\nThere does seem to be a lot of hype about this place at the moment and, while I still think there are better places to go for a burger in Edinburgh, it's tasty, good value for money with plenty of offers throughout the week, as well as a discount card, and you definitely won't leave still hungry!"
2,"I ate here last week for lunch. It's expensive, but you can't expect less for a buffet in a nice casino located on the strip. If you're not used to paying this price, don't go because you still have to remember that it's a buffet.\n\nThe portions are beautifully crafted (my initial take was to control portion waste) but its brilliant for reasons that you don't get people stirring around in the food, it gives it more of a high end feel and allows you to try everything! Just brilliant!! \n\nThe selection is smaller than what I'm normally used to though. A few of the Asian dishes were on the salty side but that may work for some people. Fried chicken wings (comes in 2 in its very own basket) was amazing--perfectly crispy, seasoned and freshly made. Salmon: good, salad: good, dessert: awesome, even for someone like me who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth. Seriously though, you can't go wrong with all you can eat gelato, right?! Right.\n\nIt appears there's a lot of hype about this place so you will have to wait a little to be seated and to get in your drink refills."
4,I literally thought I had died and gone to heaven after trasting the Greek fries. Hands down the best seasoned fries I've ever eaten. The staff was helpful and the atmosphere is very pleasant.
1,"Overpriced, small portions for food and drink, crowded, noisy, and dark.  You can get equal or better food elsewhere for less money in a more pleasant environment.  I have no idea how this place stays in business."
3,Burgers are reasonably priced and very good. The Smash fries are good with the oil. The staff was friendly but not attentive. I ordered a shake after my meal but never received it. I had to go back to the counter with my receipt and the staff told me they were sorry and brought it to my table.
4,"Hands down, best chai in Phoenix."
0,"Booked this room via Orbitz.com so perhaps I should really blame them for our awful stay here.  At any rate, we are in our mid-30's and apparently the majority of people who stay here have just turned 21.  If you stay here, you will be continuously  surrounded by dance-type music in all of the lobbies and by people who say \""dude\"" and \""oh my gawd\"" every few seconds.  The room was okay however, we were put on the 4th floor and our view consisted of the top of a parking looking structure.  Also, they charge nearly $15 for internet which is just ridiculous."
2,"I wasn't crazy about going to this show because let's face it, there are countless of real shows in Vegas that I'd rather see but it was girls night out and this is what the other hockey wives wanted to do. \n\nTickets were pricey ($75) and more than I think they're worth but it's decent girl fun and you've got to go to one of these shows at least once in your life. Unfortunately, I've been to more than I'd like to admit with various bachelorette parties so the novelty has died off long ago. I couldn't stop laughing at how cheesy the show was and I found it even more hilarious how other women were behaving.  It's all in good fun I know but seriously...some of the girls looked like they were going to faint. lol  I will admit, the men had great bodies and were nice to look at.  If I never have to go to one of these shows for the rest of my life, I will be ok with that. \n\nThe $15 cocktails at the Flirt Lounge...eek!"
4,"Hosted a small dinner party for my son, who graduated from CMU last month.  The food was amazing - all 14 people in our party raved - and the staff was so helpful.  I'd go there again, if I make it back to Pittsburgh for any reason."
2,"Like most have said on here, the service leaves a lot to be desired. We did however, go on a night when they were in the midst of planning a birthday party for an employee later that evening, and there was a lot of attention on that and very little on new patrons trying their place for the first time. We told them right from the beginning that it was our first time there and purposely sat at the bar, hoping that would keep their attention, but it didn't.   \n\nAs I sat an watched all the people and the interactions, I got the distinct feeling that for regulars it's probably a great place and maybe commands better service, but for \""strangers\"" they just aren't as attentive.  Seems like an odd philosophy if you want to build your business and welcome new business.  I had to ask for service a few times and it was really frustrating because I could see about 5 employees and wait staff all standing around just chumming with each other and talking about the upcoming party, rather than paying attention to customers. \n\nThey have great potential, but maybe need to get their priorities straight if they want the business to succeed. I would go again and give it another try though, that said, since we only had a cheese plate appetizer and I'd like to see what it's like on a regular night when they weren't so wrapped up in a special event.\n\nThe wine selections were good and the cheese plate okay (nothing special), but like I said, I feel like I should give it another try to be fair, and I'll write up a new review then."
1,"Did not like the Boba here. It was too mushy, my iced almond milk tea was warm even with the ice. The tofu snack was bland and the sauce was ketchup and sweet. The tofu snack was also very soft. The blueberry snow also sucked, according to my fiance. The best thing about this place was that it was cheaper than any boba place I've been to in California."
3,"I walked in and everyone eating there was Mexican, that's a good sign.  The food and soda were good and so was the service."
3,"Great pizza! I came here twice, both times with a Groupon, and was not disappointed. I had tomatoes and really enjoyed their caprese salad. I've tasted the Americana and Cinque Formaggi which were both great. I especially love the atmosphere and the patio is perfect when the weather is right. It is somewhere I have highly recommended since and will certainly visit again."
4,Awesome smoked wings!!!!!!
1,"I am next door neighbors with the actual Capital Brewery in Middleton so I was rooting for this experience to be awesome. Therefore, it's very sad for me to have to say that my experience here last night was pretty cringe-worthy. \n\nWe ended up at Capital Tap Haus after finding out that there was no way our group of 6 was going to get a table for Team Trivia at Tipsy Cow five minutes before it began. Someone suggested this place as an alternative, and they had Trivia at 8:30, so in we went.\n\nWe were seated and the waiter came over to take our drink orders. We each ordered either a beer or soda and waters all around. We also requested that they turn on the Brewer's game, which  the server enthusiastically agreed to do.\n\n10 minutes pass. No water. No drinks. TV channel still showing not-Brewers.\n\nA member of our party (politely) flagged down a different server and requested the Brewer's game on TV. This server also agreed to do it for us. 10 more minutes pass and the game still isn't on.\n\nThis went on for awhile, and it seemed like it was taking forever for them to change the channel and bring water. The restaurant was almost empty too, so there wasn't much excuse for the extremely inattentive service. In the end, we had to ask 2 or 3 different people FOUR times for the Brewer's game before they turned it on! It also took way too long to get our water and drinks.\n\nThis alone didn't ruin the experience for me...what ruined the experience was that nothing else about the night was good either. Service continued to be slow and inattentive. The  general consensus of our table was that that food was overpriced and mediocre. For example, they charge $3.00 for a side of regular fries with any sandwich or burger, and the fries were served cold and soggy. I know rent on State St. is expensive, but really? \n\nThe one saving grace  of my otherwise dismal experience, and the reason I refrained from giving the Capital Tap Haus  one star, was that the sandwich I ordered, a Reuben, was very tasty. I would say that it ranked in the upper 20% of Reubens that I've had in my life: Thick and toasty marble rye, flavorful and *tender* corned beef, tangy, but not overpowering sauerkraut, and \""perfect-amount-of sweet\"" thousand island dressing.\n\nWould I return to the Capital Tap Haus? Probably not anytime soon."
1,"What were we thinking??\nApparently we weren't when we booked what was told to us be a four-star hotel.  Really?  I think 3-star would have been plenty generous.  \n\nHow can they still call these rooms suites??  The last time I stayed here, the rooms were REAL suites.  And no, it wasn't when I was 10 years old and things maybe seemed bigger when you're smaller.  I was an adult, though a poor college student.  Our room this time was half the size of what a suite should be. What a rip.\n\nI call into question the cleanliness of the facilities.  When we arrived we saw a lot of debris in the hallway - our room was at the end so we saw it all.  This included a piece of smashed bread in front of a particular \""suite\"" that stayed there for another day before it was cleaned up.  We woke up the next morning to see a suspicious looking Rio shopping bag in front of our door (prob filled with barf based on the celebratory noises that woke us up in the wee hours) that stayed there for most of the day as well.\n\nOn top of that, it doesn't appear that there's any security....at other mid-grade hotels, they at least have someone checking room keys before letting you up the elevators.  I guess they assume here, you'd have to be staying here to want to go up to the rooms.  \n\nThe old adage you get what you pay for is definitely evident here:  early early morning drunken pounding on doors, smelly shower curtains that maintenance never replaced at the behest of THEIR OWN MAIDS, smokey casino and all."
2,"You would think the \""W\"" and Scottsdale makes a great combo. and a no brainer for a 3 night stay, NOT don't get too excited and don't expect a whole lot. I found this place to have no personality at all. the life is at the Bar but the Lobby and entrance were like an airport terminal. Sorry, Not Digging it over at The \""W\"" in Scottsdale.\nBar area was nice until asked to leave for a private event.\n\nThe Galleria close by made up for what was lacking though."
2,"When I visited Nostrano the first time, years ago, I was not only impressed with the food but with the service as well. The food was delicious and our server had a vast knowledge of both the food and alcohol they served. They were very attentive and I was eager to visit again. If I was writing this review at that time, I would have given 5 out of 5 stars. \n\nUnfortunately over the years the quality of service has slowly declined. The staff isn't as knowledgeable nor as attentive. Our most recent visit to Nostrano today was extremely disappointing. It's Restaurant Week so I give restaurants a little slack on food quality and service. It's a crazy busy time so I imagine it is a stressful experience for the staff. However, when we arrived for our lunch reservations (a party of 4), only about 25% of the tables were occupied. It was pretty slow. We placed our orders right away, with my husband asking for his dessert to be boxed right up front, and the first course was delivered quickly. Our second course came about 20 minutes after our initial dishes were cleared away. A little long, but again, restaurant week, I'll let it slide. \n\nOur server was not super attentive to our table but our drink glasses were kept full by other staff members as they went by the table. Midway through our main course we advised our server that we were on a tight timeline and would need dessert and our bill soon. 30 minutes after the main course we still didn't have either and half our party had to leave to get back to work on time. The server refused to pack the dessert to go, even though that had been an initial request for one of the meals. The excuse was that the dessert wouldn't keep well; however, it surprises me that Nostrano wouldn't be prepared to send desserts home with their guests. Isn't that an age old tradition? Taking your dessert to go?\n\nAnyway, another twenty or so minutes later, still no dessert while the table behind us that came in during our main course is well into their own desserts. I had already left and by that time my husband had had enough. He expressed his dissatisfaction and left (even though we ended up paying for the full meal). \n\nNostrano has always been the place we go when we get a date night. I'm sure we'll be back, but it won't be our first choice anymore."
3,If your looking for the best veggie burger around definitely try there abstract burger! I eat meat on a regular basis but also try different meat alternatives all the time. I cant even try there regular burger because the veggie is so good! You can build it anyway you want with an array of toppings. You can even get it on a Hawaiian sweet roll bun. The sweet potato fries are really good as well. The staff is friendly and helpful. Better than your average burger joint and worth checking out.
3,"Fettuccini Alfredo, Baked Ravioli were both great. The starter bread was good enough that I skipped the dipping oil and the wait staff was friendly and quick. Well worth sitting down to eat rather than grabbing a slice to go. \nThe menu has enough vegetarian options to make it an actual choice. The 20% off drew us in and I would be happy to stop here again on a future trip."
0,"4/19/12 @ 7:30 PM.  We hoped for a nice, quiet dinner in our neighborhood.  We'd been to the locale--the former John Henry's many times in the past 15+ years and while disappointed when JH closed its doors, wanted to support this local business that eventually opened in the same location.\n\nThe first time was shortly before Christmas, 2011.  The kitchen was out of order due to some \""technical problem\"".  We went again between then and New Years to have an \""OK\"" experience given the newness of the place.\n\nWe went two other times this year to experience nothing more than average service and food.\n\nFast forward to this evening.  We get there at about 7:30 for dinner.  A party of about 6 or 7 is on the outdoor patio.  Some one is playing live music at the far end of the bar.  There's one occupied table in the dining room.\n\nAfter a few minutes, someone from the bar area came to the hostess station and when we said we were there for dinner, were told we could either sit on the patio OR in the bar area.  \n\nWhen we asked why the limits since the dining room was totally open and the waitress would have to walk by our potential table to take care of the patio patrons, no real explanation was given.  We left.  WE WILL NOT BE BACK.  \n\nVery poor customer service, customer relations and behaviors. \n\nWe will NOT EVER consider, recommend or otherwise consider returning to this place under the current ownership, management and name.  \n\nHopefully for the reputation of the building and the memories of fine dining and good service of the past, G & S will be a bad dream very soon and the venue will be open for some business with a REAL focus on customer service, dining and patron satisfaction will move in and erase the bad taste that this business has left in our mouths and our memories."
3,"Ce que j'ai aime de l'endroit: plusieurs terrasses, plusieurs pistes de dance avec des styles de musique differents, les dj sont trop bons, le personnels gentils et y a plein de petits bar, et l'alcool est pas cher. J'ai aime la deco, surtout les effets lumieres et l'ambiance qui change d'une salle a l'autre selon nos gouts. \n\nLe gros bemol pour moi (je me fais vieille) c'est tellement chaud et humide et a certain endroit ca pu le swing intense. Pour une soiree intense de dance ou un drink sur la terrasse c'est un bon endroit. \n\nAttention ambiance vraiment differente un soir de semaine, c'est plus 5 a 7 25 ans et plus! Pour y avoir ete souvent!"
0,Terrible! My father-in-law got a haircut there just today and the guy cut his eyelid! Didn't even apologize! Didn't offer free haircut! Awful service!!
1,"Way too expensive for what it is.  I ordered a beer and got a 8 ounce glass half full of foam.  My date's cosmo was the same size as the beer.  Bread baskets were full of mediocre store bought bread.  Entrees were best thing, but still not as good as if I woud have made my own short rib in the crock pot at home.  Baked potato was completely average.  Atmosphere was okay once you got past the fact you were in a dumpy hotel on the wrong side of town, and the service was attentive (only area that gives this review 2 stars as opposed to 1)."
0,"Terrible experience at this Starbucks store the few times I have visited.  The last one was the absolute worst.  The bathrooms were filthy, dirty, dirty floors, fecese were on the back of the toilet tank, toilet paper pieces were all over the floor and the two rolls of toilet paper in the dispenser were out.  The barista at the cash register did not know what she was doing and the line took forever due to each transaction being a problem.  Now move onto getting my drink: the barista got my drink wrong twice (I ordered a simple iced grande skim latte....I mean how hard it that to make?) on the last try(#3) he just poured brewed coffee over ice and did not pull the expected shots.  I went back to the cashier to see if I could talk to the manage....but guess what...the manager was the guy who just made my drink! I gave up.  Then I went to put sugar in my coffee and noticed that the trash was overflowing onto the counter, it obviously had not been wiped off in a while and product was missing.  I can't believe that no one else has complained about this location before."
0,My hubby and I were here for the APA Pool Tournament.  My husband managed to get his toe nail caught on a sharp piece on one of the room chairs and pulled his entire toenail off.  I called housekeeping and the front desk for assistance and talked to a lifeguard as well as a maid in the hallway and no one would help us out with first aid supplies or medical assistance.  The staff was very rude.
3,"I stopped here with a few friends for a late night dinner last Third Fridays, and was rather impressed!\nIt doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is well arranged and even has a little stage for music performances. (There was a jazz musician there playing music while we ate. It was rather beautiful.)\nI wasn't very hungry, so I ordered a quesadilla with chorizo. It was rather large for being under $5, which left me impressed.\nUnfortunately, the waitress forgot to mention that they don't accept debit cards for orders under $5. Thankfully, one of my friends spotted me $5, so there wasn't an issue there.\nTwo of my friends got the soup of the night and a sandwich, and both were rather good!\nI'll definitely go back when I'm more hungry and order something larger and more exciting than a quesadilla."
0,"Why is there still no zero stars rating option on Yelp? This 'business' deserves it for failing to provide enough shuttles for the endless lines of arriving passengers; for allowing sadistic employees like Willie to browbeat paying customers waiting hours for the nonexistent shuttles; and for drivers who refuse to carry passengers to their hotels because they're inconveniently \""too far off the Strip.\""  A very sad joke."
1,"Two stars for the food, 5 stars for the bartenders and free popcorn. Sent the dog biscuit dry chicken back, got dry flavorless ribs in its stead. Don't eat here. But great place to come for drinks!"
0,"Um, how did the other reviewers get food????\n\nJ and I went in on a Friday night with a WPXI half off deal.  We were ready to engulf ourselves in burgers and beers for at least $50 worth. \n\nInstead, I went to the bar and asked for a menu since there was no one else working in the place besides the one bartender on a Friday night.  She gave me a tiny happy hour menu.  I said, no, I'd like the dinner menu.  She said they weren't serving food besides happy hour.  I said, right now or ever?  She said ever.  They were getting new menus printed and weren't serving food.  \n\nShe did not tell me when they would be done or what else I should get.  I told her that I had a coupon.  She smiled and said nothing. \n\nSince WPXI won't get back to me about returning the half off deal - if only I could write a review on that - we will be returning for drinks and happy hour, but I will not be spending a cent more than the coupon. \n\nWho doesn't serve food when you advertise that you are the best burger in the city?"
0,"Service was awful we went for happy hour. We got 1 beer  a burger to share and an appetizer, never saw our waiter again till he brought the bill.    Which was to bad as the burger was cold, cheese was just sitting on the meat, not even a tad melted. We ordered the meat medium, but it was pretty raw!  We each had a bite and left it!  When the waiter brought the bill, we said it would have been nice to have another drink he said, well I have a party of 10.  That isn't our fault, get him help! We won't go back!!! Oh and when the waiter heard we were sharing food he insisted on cutting it in half for us, then charged us for it! AWFUL place don't waste your time, hit the hot dog place outside Quad or something!"
0,No!\n\nI said - NO!!!
3,"Fuel Pizza is very convenient for us and we have ordered takeout several times. The pizza here is good and is quite thick and filling. There are several Charlotte area locations and a location in DC. The chicken pesto pizza and the \""whole engine\"" pizzas are my favorite. The wings are also very good and meaty although you have to ask for blue cheese dressing if you'd rather have that than ranch. Also neat: you can order online and they offer both whole wheat and gluten free crust options - a nice touch. At our location (Southend) the atmosphere is lively and fun. I look forward to checking out the original Central Ave. location in the near future as well."
0,"I recently moved to the Farm House Meadows right down the street from the Gilbert Zipps. I was excited when I came for the first time last Sunday! The bar tender was great, the patrons were friendly, and the food was delicious! I had such a good time playing pool, shuffle board, and hanging out I came back Monday with one of the guys on my Landscaping Team! We had such a great time we stayed from 7-11 shooting pool, playing music on the juke box, and enjoying a large meal! Our server Tanya, was amazing she had a huge section to attend to, but did such an amazing job that you would have thought we were her only table.\n\nWith the above said, my mind was blown when Sebastian (the same person who was there with me Monday) and I returned Thursday! While I went to the quarter machine to make change for pool and the juke box, the server informed Sebastian that he needed to be 21 yrs of age to shoot pool at that time or even be in the restaurant. He told me about the rule which we were unaware of. We were hungry and ready to eat, and bummed out cause we rode our bikes there. I asked to speak to the manager to ask if he could make an exception and allow us to eat dinner on the patio, out of the bar area. He informed me of the strict company policy that he needed to adhere to and that there was no way we could stay. \n\nAt that point I understood the policy and respected the rules. I politely asked to have  the 15 dollars in quarters I had got exchanged for cash (as I rode my bike and did want to loose the coins on the ride home). He then rudely said, \""I would have to roll all those quarters, and I don't have time for that.\"" I said are you kidding me?!!! And he said yes I can't make change for those quarters unless YOU roll them for us! At that point I lost my cool and was very frustrated. I told the manager I would take my business elsewhere and would never be back again! He just said ok and walked into his office.... Wow my mind was blown!!!\n\nOur server from the other night Tanya, observed my frustration with the manager, and asked what happened? I told her and she on her own time, as she had just clocked out, took my quarters, apologized for the manager and said I hope you guys do come back! \n\nI highly doubt that we will be back! But if we do come back it won't be on the Thursday night managers shift!!!  \n\nI'm not sure, but maybe you should start \""making time\"" for customer service, because I don't have time for that B.S.!!!!!!!"
4,"Amazing service from Jelly for lunch today, and seriously good food!  A wonderful hot sauce with heat and a great pico start things before you even get to sample the tasty tacos and enchiladas.  Highly recommended."
4,"I loved this place, it was so nice to walk around and feel away from the desert.  I bought some apples and some pretzel breads.  The apples were GREAT, took me back to when I could eat apples right off the tree, best thing in life! The pretzel breads were sooooo good, we packed them with some trader joe's cheeses and the apples and some chocolate for a picnic on our hike of mcdowell mountain, it was great!"
4,"Holy smokes! This place blew me away! We had a party of twelve today prepping for a wedding tomorrow. The staff was speedy, expert, courteous and accommodating. No point of service was forgotten...from shuttling us to and from the salon from our strip hotels, to champagne and cookies when we arrived, to closing the doors to walk-ins so we could feel perfectly at home. I love my manicure and pedicure, and was sooo impressed with how each of ours turned exactly as we wanted!"
0,My suggestion to anyone looking for a venue DO NOT give your money to these people.  They no longer have a spot on 8826 Eastern.  They are still taking money from people under false pretense.  SCAM ARTIST is all Rebecca is.  She is not to be trusted.
1,"The Egg...\n\nI try a lot of breakfast places and I have tried several of their locations and each time I have I have had a good plain breakfast. The truth is it was nothing special. The food is just that, nothing special. \n\nThe Good, the place is nice, friendly staff.\n\nThe Bad, they are normaly short staffed and this leads to mistakes. I've had 3 bad meals due to server error. Each time fixed but given how busy they are, they should be better prepared. Lastly, the food just isn't that good. The steak and eggs are plain and the beef dosn't taste like steak... \n\nLast word is I'd rather go to Denny's if I am going to have a basic breakfast. It's a better chain..."
4,"Five fist-pumping stars!!  A sweet piece of Jersey in the Queen City!!  The wonderful class of New Jersey has found a spot in Charlotte to call its own.  Mattie's Diner is my little slice of heaven.  As much as I am embarrassed to admit that I am a New Jersian (thanks to the TV show Jersey Shore), today I feel a little more proud of my roots.  Our little state is the capital of the world for diners.  You can't spin once around without seeing two or three diners.  And we love it that way.  It also makes us \""fist pumpers\"" from the Jerz laugh a little when people call their restaurants down here... a \""DINER\"".   Until now... Mattie's is authentic!!  Authentic authentic auuuuuuthentic.. Fist-Pump approved!  \n\nMy better half and I just had to stop here after Yelpy hour with our fellow Yelpers.  I thought the location was a little weird but then soon realized the genius behind it.  It is placed near an evolving night life locale.  I would imagine that Mattie's gets swamped with people from 11pm -3am.  Hoards of hungry and \""not so thirsty\"" clubbers.. I would suggest going here during normal human hours and taking in what the whole place has to offer.  50's style with that homemade spice!  We ordered your basic breakfast meals (eggs/bacon) and then topped that off with a flapjack.  If I were to going to try to describe how good it was and how fast we ate it, I would say something like this... \""\""mmmm gmmgmgmmgmsmgm (breathe) mmmammgmmmummmgmg (breathe)  gulpgulpgulp mmumumumumm aaannnnd done.\""  Next time, I am really going to concentrate on slowing down and enjoying it more.  That is what round 2 is for, right?  \n\nWe finished in record time and were told that we have to try the burger and the meatloaf.  It is supposedly the best thing on the menu.  Check back for a burger update soon.  Make the trip out here and give it a try.  Oh yeah.. Whole tab = $12 (for two)  Yeah!  Enjoy!  \n\n-Ian M."
1,"I visited J & G Steakhouse on the last night of my vacation at The Phoenician.  We decided to stay close due to a thunderstorm brewing. Walking into the restaurant I was impressed. The decor is inviting and the view is relaxing. I had high hopes. The menu has something for everyone- steak, of course, seafood and chicken. For a prix fixe, $35, you can have a 3 course meal which I think is pretty reasonable. Both myself and my dinner partner ordered the lobster which was only okay as it was a tad bit overcooked. You may be wondering why I gave this restaurant only 2 stars. Well, I've never had such bad service ( well maybe at McDonalds). Our waiter took our initial order and we hardly saw him again. His assistant, whom he never even introduced, came by to offer additional rolls and eventually take our dessert order. For example, I ordered a glass of wine but no one ever asked if I needed a refill instead someone just took my glass away when it was empty.  We did make a comment to our waiter about not seeing much of him and were met with random chitchat-- very odd.  In the end, the manager came over and we expressed how we felt. He was VERY apologetic and took one of our lobster dinners off our tab. So that was nice."
1,"I love CJ's, some of the better quality fast food around, but this place is AWFUL. Always out of apple slices, and half the staff INSISTS there is no such thing as a large order of onion rings. I am consistently dissatisfied here, but unless I feel like driving all the way to Fiesta Mall I'm stuck going here. I'm giving it 2 stars because even though the people that work here are dumb as bricks, they are usually really friendly."
2,This is usually the starting point for any\njourney I take that's more than a day's drive\nso I'm pretty used to this airport. Convenient.\nI like that they have a economy parking lot on\nthe east side and that you can take a shuttle\nto your terminal. I prefer that to dealing with\nSuper Shuttle stopping all over town before they\nfinally get you home. Also they have decent shops\nwhere you can get Arizona souvenirs in case you\ndidn't have time or just remembered at the very \nlast moment. Food prices though are pretty damn\noutrageous. Arrive having eaten. The TSA deal\nis now usually very smooth and fast. And most of\nthe time you don't even go through the pervscan\nanyway. Come early if you're going through US Airways\nthough. Those are the most cramped terminals where\nyou won't even find a seat in the waiting area if\nthe flight is full. And the bathrooms are decent\ntoo. Enough stalls so that you usually never have\nto wait in line even if a flight from some 3rd world\ncountry just came in and everybody on the flight had \nfood poisoning.
0,"Ok so first whoever commented below it is NOT a closed location,  Clean and tropic ambient atmosphere, our server however was slow as molasses, was not overly busy took 15 minutes from time we sat down to get drinks.  We ordered a Kilauea burger and a long boarder was mediocre at best,  service sucked not very hospitable, the kitchen messed up our orders twice had a white bun bottom with a wheat top on one and completely wrong type of burger on the other,  I expect better service and food for that!"
4,"The sister property of the Venetian, the Palazzo is one of our favorite places to go when we decide to go to the Strip.  Here's why:\n\n- We enjoy the food & beverage options here.  LAVO, Dos Caminos, and Double Helix are a few of our favorites.\n\n- Easy access to the self parking garage.  It's located just off Twain Ave, which is off the Strip.  It makes it easy for us locals to get in/out of the property.  We prefer to park here than at the Venetian.  We often park here and walk to the Venetian.\n\n- FREE Wifi on the casino floor.  Yes, you can connect on the casino floor for FREE!  This is very beneficial when there's a convention or meeting at the property and you need internet access.\n\n- The rooms here are spectacular and can be found for reasonable rates in this down economy.\n\nWill I return?  You bet."
1,"I went with extremely high expectations. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. I didn't feel the passion/connection among the actors. Sure they get naked, have some fun, and are naughty. I thought there would be more of a connection where you could feel the love and passion between the people on stage. I think this could be done with appropriate music and eye contact and caressing."
1,"I don't even know where to start. It was a really confusing experience. We got there 15 minutes before their tapas menu and $5 martini happy hour (normally $9) was ending. Right away we knew we wanted to order the pretzel sticks with cheese sauce which were on their menu online. We noticed it was not on the menu, so we asked the waiter. I said, \""oh I guess we don't have it anymore if it isn't on there.\"" He then asked if we wanted a martini menu, which we did even though we aren't big vodka fans. He came back to take our drink order after happy hour was over, so we decided not to get martinis. \n\n It was 50 degrees outside and the had the patio door open. Right when we sat down I noticed how cold it was, I had goosebumps and I was shivering. Some people asked to be moved away from the door, we ended up asking them if they would close it, and they did. Then they just went and propped open the front door! Just as cold.\n\nWe saw online it was half price sangria on Wednesdays, so we asked what kinds they had. The waiter said whatever kind we wanted, so we asked if they had sparkling. He said sure no problem. Another 20 minutes went by, and I saw at the bar the bartender and waiter were talking and looked confused about how to make the sangria. It came out and did not look right. I asked what was in it and the waiter said champagne, lemonade, orange juice, SPRITE, and a random assortment of fruit that I think were garnish for martinis (strawberries, raspberries, blackberries). It was sour and tasted nothing like sangria. They said they would fix it. Another 10 minutes went by and they brought it back. It tasted even worse! We asked what they added to it and all they added was pinot grigio. We let them know we know longer wanted sangria. The bartender came over, asked what we didn't like about it, we explained that we aren't used to having sangria made with champagne and sprite. She said, \""well you asked for sparkling and we don't have sparkling sangria, we only have red.\"" Why would the waiter not have told us that? \n\nShe asked what we wanted to drink instead. I asked about a couple bottles of wine that they were sold out of. She recommended a wine that they were charging $50 a bottle for that I know sells for less than $10 in the grocery store. She said when we figured out what we wanted to tell our waiter. So we figured we would ask about their craft beer choices. The waiter didn't know what varietals each  brand of beer was, he said one was dark and one was fruity. Well he got them backwards, and neither was really dark or fruity. By now we had been there about 45 minutes, so we told them we would stick to water with dinner and have dessert martinis after. He brought us his favorite martini on the house which was the antioxidant. It was fine, but like we told him, we don't really like vodka. We took a couple sips and left the rest. \n\nAfter ordering dinner some bread was brought out with garlic oil and a balsamic jelly. There were 2 very thin slices of white bread which was good and 2 stale pieces of jalapeno focaccia bread which was inedible. There was such little oil on the plate, I thought they were joking at first and were going to give us a bottle on the side to pour ourselves. I am not kidding, it barely even coated half of this little plate. \n\nOur dinner came out quickly. My fiance ordered the cheese tortellini. It was definitely the packaged frozen kind, and some were really hard while others were soft. I got the penne vodka with chicken and bacon. It was actually really delicious! But I don't think either was worth $18. We have had much better, fresher, cheaper pasta in the area at places like Spaghetti Western and The Sparklings. \n\nWhen we were done the waiter came over and asked if we wanted banana cream pie. We said we didn't like banana cream pie, and he walked away. Shortly he came back with our check. I see on reviews they have other desserts, but they never offered to show us a dessert menu or tell us what other desserts they have. We also had told them we were going to get dessert martinis, but they must have forgot. \n\nEven thought the penne vodka was good, after all that we would not go back. The only place I would recommend this place is if you like martinis, because they have over 100 on their menu."
4,If ELVIS were alive he would LOVE the Valley Ho Hotel! Probably just as much as I do.  This is the ONLY hotel I stay at when I come to ARIZONA.
0,"I came here once and knew I would never return.  It wasn't that the food was bad.  They had no hot sauce other than Tabasco.  CAn you imagine a Tex/Mex restaurant without Cholula or Tapatio? \n\nI sent a comment to the company via their website and I never got an answer.  With so many Tex/Mex choices available, I'll be glad to drive by this place and keep on going!"
3,"Authentic Salvadorean food is especially hard to find.  When I found out there was a Salvadorean restaurant nearby in Downtown Kitchener, I just had to go try it out. \n\nThe Guanaquita Restaurant is located up a long flight of stairs up above a watering hole near King & Water. The look of the restaurant will throw first time customers off as it is noticeably Greek. Perhaps, it used to be Greek restaurant in a past life. There is a small patio facing King Street and a dance floor for various events happening at the restaurant. \n\nSince I lived nearby, I always called ahead for take out and never had a chance to sit down so I cannot comment on the service. It usually takes them 15-20 minutes to get your order ready.  \n\nOne of the most commonly ordered plates is the Guanaquita Platter - a set platter with pork and cheese pupusas, beef or chicken enchilada, chicken tamales and a beef & vegetable empanada. The platter also came with a side of salsa (I always get the hot one) and coleslaw. \n\nAll the items in the platter were made fresh and full of flavour and reminded me of  The salsa also added the extra kick needed for me when eating Latin American food. I was not a fan of the coleslaw though. \n\nThe only caveat for me is that it is closed on Sundays and Mondays. \n\nAll in all, a great place for some Salvadorean food whether it is your first time or whether you are just satisfying a craving."
4,"Salon X and Christian are amazing.  Christian is a certified professional in coloring hair.  One of only a few in the Valley.  Christian has always listened to what I what to do with my hair, and never has there been any surprises!  It took me 33 years to find a Stylist, and I can honestly say that it was worth the wait.."
2,"This is a fast paced Vietnamese place. I wouldn't necessarily consider it a restaurant. It's clean, but can be crowded because of the tight spaces between the tables. The creepy bathrooms need improving. I only go here for rare steak Pho. However I have tried their steak & broccoli, & it was yummy. Their Pho is good, tastes like any other Pho noodles. The service isn't golden. & the staff is pretty slow to respond. Fast chefs, slow servers. Overall, they have the best Pho place name & is open 24/7! The only Pho place I go to cause of the fast pace food & decent pricing."
4,"Our family ate at Dos Caminos last night, slightly nervous after reading the reviews. We were pleasantly surprised at every turn. The white Sangria was fantastic, as were the chips, salsa and guacamole. Our family is pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food and we thought this was wonderful. Service was excellent."
2,I keep going to Paradise Bakery expected to be impressed or at least enjoy the food more than I do: I've had the chicken salad and paradise club. Both are eh. I'd rather go to Port of Subs or Jimmy Johns. The cookies are good but super sweet -- so much sugar. The soup is kind of gross -- I had the chicken and wild rice and had the texture of soupy jello.\n\nI'll go here if i have to but it's certainly not my first choice. Maybe I just need to find something I like here.
3,"Oh Dell Taco, how I love you.  I know, I know, I'm reviewing the local Dell Taco?  Who does that?  However, I've eaten dinner here about six out of the past seven days, so I feel that I'm justified in writing this review.  I pretty much only get the 1/2 pound bean & cheese burrito, the chicken soft taco, and maybe the bean & cheese cup.  Mmm good; make sure to smother everything in hot sauce.  \n\nI once threw in a Macho burrito and ate the whole thing; but that was a mistake because it was about the size of my thigh, ugh.  Seriously, way too much food.  \n\nI've only ever gone through the drive-thru for dinner and late night.  The workers are nice; very diverse -- there's an African-American guy with crazy hair who works the night shift, a nice Hispanic girl who works the evenings, and a nondescript middle-aged white guy who works the weekends.  Anyway, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come to this Dell Taco specifically, but it's close to my house, so I go, way too much."

0,I can't believe it's really over. I was reluctant to believe Phillip C. but when I saw it with my own 2 eyes it nearly brought me to tears. Other than the 99 cent deep fried twinkies & oreos at Mermaids there really was no other reason to go downtown except Jillian's-IT will be missed. Especially the concerts.
0,"Went in at 10:15 and the kitchen was closed, even for the late night menu. Not cool. Will not be returning"
3,Bought my vehicle here last summer and was very pleased with the entire process.  Everyone went overboard to get me that exact vehicle I wanted. \nSince then I've gotten my oil changed here (free oil changes for 2 years was part of the deal) and the service continues to be excellent.
2,Is this place still open??? drove by a cpl weeks ago and it was all boarded up!!!
4,Molly is AMAZING! She's such a sweet girl and I always love getting my lashes done...it's like having girl time together :)  She's getting really popular and busy so contact her now for an appointment!
2,"Another tourist trap bar on the Mile, the World's End is slightly less rammed than the others because it's a bit further down. Apart from that though it's similar to Deacon Brodie's etc in that the drinks are overpriced, it's overly Scottish and there is little atmosphere. It is also tiny, which means as soon as a few people pop in it does get full. This rarely happens though, as most people either don't know about it or do and stay away.\n\nUnless you're a tourist or have forgotten what Scotland is then probably best to steer clear of here...y'hear??"
4,"This is great place for the NoDa neighborhood.  Glad to see something different in the area with a nice vibe, but yet cool enough to relax and enjoy some good food.\n\nSeems some people have been pretty critical for a new restaurant open only 4 weeks.  They are still working through the kinks and have taken a lot of feedback from customers such as lowering prices and changing up the beer selection.  Glad to see they are taking customer's feedback seriously and willing to adapt.  I've been there many different times and have tried the different dishes each time, and have not been disappointed in anything I ordered thus far!"
3,"Ate there on Mothers Day and NO WAIT for seating or food this time! YEA! I got the Cuban sandwich (I AM Cuban, from Miami) which was a fair sandwich for being done in NC, but NOT a true Cuban sandwich. Still, it WAS tasty and huge and the bread (which waiter told me is flown in daily from Tampa) was the best! I got the coleslaw as my side...decent slaw, not vinegar, not milky type. My son got the pork plate with mac n cheese and slaw sides. He is a strapping young man, hungry...and the portions filled him well. We got one of the bacon wrapped jalapeno appetizers and they are decent, too. Ours were cold when served, but tasty and I will go by and get them 'as a meal' from now on. Their margarita is tasty...enough alcohol and good tasting mix. Son got two different beers, one the Blue Moon, the other I didn't sample as I was driving. We'd sat on the patio in the evening before it got dark...nice! We'd go back again. I did notice that you can get a plate of sides, differing amounts, and I often eat strange like that (gastric bypass past). That way I'd have several meals of several healthy foods, but I'll be a regular bacon wrapped jalapenos peep IF they'll cook them to order so I get them HOT."
3,"I have ordered and picked up lunch for over 10 people at Thai Hana, and also have eaten in restaurant with a smaller group.  Both times I have been delighted with the food and service.\n\nMy most recent visit to Thai Hana was with a group of 3.  I ordered the 2 roll lunch, Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon, and the sushi was really tasty, and big enough to be STUFFED after 2 rolls.  My friends got fried rice and an eggplant dish and both were very pleased with their meals.  The real star of this joint, though, is the service.  Our waiter was really what made Thai Hana stand out apart from all other lunch sites in Oakland.  He was friendly, even though he was busy, and really made us feel welcome and special.  He joked around with us, suggested items, and was very prompt with our order.  He recommended the Thai Iced Tea, one of my favorites, which I didn't even know they had. \n\nNext time you're in Oakland treat yourself to lunch or dinner at Thai Hanna!"
2,"This popular little restaurant in the Mekong Plaza complex serves inexpensive, filling Chinese food fast. I find their food to be quite tasty, though it would have been better if they held back on the salt a bit. Service is friendly and efficient, the whole setting is very informal, and I do enjoy the boba they serve here. I'll definitely be coming back to try the salt and pepper smelt (I love smelt) and other items they serve that are not normally found in most semi-fast food Chinese places."
0,"This Dick's used to have excellent customer service. I don't know what changed, but they don't any more.  In fact, the people who work there are now kind of...\n\nOk, well, perhaps that joke is a little TOO obvious.\n\nSeriously, though. I don't care how much cool stuff you have or how awesome your sales are.  If I ask you if you have a shoe in a certain size and you answer \""probably not\"" and walk away without even looking at me, I won't be buying anything from your store.\n\nWell, I suppose this is why they invented Zappos."
3,Always friendly and great food but the person working the last window through the drive-through messed up....he just gave me my order and didn't repeat back what it was and seemed in a hurry to do something else than take the time for the customer at the drive-through. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.
0,"Stay away from this place!!!. Its a nice place, especially their different floor plans. I chose to live in the town homes. At first I felt like I was at home when I first moved in until I started getting warnings from my neighbors how much the landlord fines and complains about everything. \n\nThe management wont accept  rent unless its all in full. They force you to be late so they can get there fees and legal fees etc. They don't even have a rent  drop box, so the tenants can actually pay on time. If you choose to pay online they will charge a $60 fee on top of your rent. The management are rude! When I surrendered my lease, which I never wanted to do, the lady in the office wanted to change the reason why I wanted to move out. SMH!!!\n\nThis place is such a disappointment because it is very beautiful. SMH. If your rent is $1400 and you're short $50 they wont accept it. I search for places and before I moved in here I checked the yelp reviews about this place and it was all bad, but I was stubborn and I moved into this place anyways.... I should've trusted the reviews.\n\n Also you can hear your next door neighbors conversation because the walls are very very thin... Make sure to whisper at all times, because if I can hear my next doors business, they can definitely hear mine.\n\nIf you have visitors with dogs, beware cause you will get fine for it too. It looks expensive but the quality of their cabinets etc. are all cheap!!! The AC is loud as hell!!! I can also hear my neighbor walking up and down the stairs from my bottom master bedroom and hearing them talk...\n\n I'd rather live in a better place with better management...\n\nRUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!\n\nThis place doesn't care about their tenants, all they want is your money and they don't care if you surrender or break your lease because it's how they're getting paid.... When you break or surrender your lease, make sure you have over $8K to pay, or your credit is ruined."
0,"In sum, never be back again. Unless you just want a cheap place on strip, and don't care about anything else, go for it.\n\nPro: cheap room, Sunday 58per night + 28 resort fee per room similar as elsewhere.\nRoom is not big but clean and okay.\nCons:\n1. Heavy Smokey casino, \n2. No coffee maker, want hotwater for drink? Pay for it.\n3.super bad attitude of service department, when I called them about the drinking hotwater, they treat me super rude, \""do you have hotpot to make hot water?\"" \""No we don't have any available now.\"" \""How about ?.....\"" Beep beep .... They cut off the phone!?! \n4. Don't care about customer complain, ask for supervisor, frond desk will transfer you quickly to a line, so called \""supervisor\"", and well, you will never get chance to speaks with a human, all you got is a voicemai box and manager never return back call"
4,Highly recommend getting your tint done with them. Have used them on many different cars and the quality is great!
0,"The only reason I shop at this store is b/c it's the one in my area. First of all, Folks-if you get bad meat or anything else that's not right, TAKE IT BACK and get your money back. As long as you have your receipt and a good reason, they can't turn you down without risking a visit from the County Health District once you report it. This store is awful in terms of customer service and the prices are very high; maybe not compared to Albertson's  but if you have transportation, Trader Joe's will impress you mightily with their products and prices as well as their clientele. You can also find a lot of the same products at a much lower price at Walmart. I have seen  pricing on a small item - at Smith's -  anywhere from a dollar to 3 dollars higher for the same product I can get at Walmart. I only shop items that are on sale at Smith's, otherwise I am paying too much. \n\nThe  good things I can say is that when I've been there the produce department looked very good and most of the stuff looked fresh. But unless it's on sale the prices are comparably high. Also you can refill your own by-the-gallon water inside the store for only 25 cents each and it's very good.\n\nYou can avoid a lot of the riffraff that shop at this Smith's  by going in the morning before 10 or 11. \n\nMany of us are just waiting and hoping for a new store like the Kathy's store which used to be on east Flamingo or Desert Inn back in the day, then became Wild Oats then moved to Henderson to a more sophisticated type of clientele than the folks who were moving into this general area, and became a Whole Foods with the most absurd prices I've seen yet, prices I refuse to support so I never shop there. Some consumers can be really stupid, and keep prices high for the rest of us. \n\n Now that the downtown area is drawing more of the hip crowd, we can only hope that those of us who are smart consumers will get a new Kathy's type store--small but with great products and excellent pricing. Take note, Trader Joe's, you're missing an opportunity!"
1,"It was just fine for delivery. It took them almost an hour to deliver but they were courteous and helpful on the phone. \n\nThe food was just fine. I ordered the large chicken and broccoli (it comes with white meat) and asked if that came with rice. Well it does, but only a tiny pint. \n\nThe egg drop soup was sub-standard.\n\nJust moved to Phoenix and will probably keep looking for other chinese delivery places."
3,The show was great. It was reasonably priced and the theater was relatively small so there were no bad seats. The story line itself was enigmatic in nature so I would not recommend taking younger children. It definitely lived up to its name of Mystere because I found that the group of people I went with had several different interpretations of the show. I really enjoyed the production as a whole.
4,"I've been here about a dozen times now and I have never written a review.... but I could write a super review for each of those times.  Tonight I was on my own so I got galee gai and sticky rice to go.  The galee gai is a spicy yellow curry - similar to masaman curry but spicier.  Now, I am a total wimp and this is always spicier than I really can handle but it is so good I deal with it!  I put it on rice and drink a lot of tea :-)  The sticky rice is coconut sweet and, well, sticky.  I have ordered sticky rice at other places and it never compares to Wild Thaiger.  I am happy to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!"
2,"Island Sushi has a lot of potential to it, but unfortunately to me it seemed like just another ordinary sushi bar. The service here is nice, but it's more of the dishes that are bland. Nothing over the top or colorful. This is more of a neighborhood sushi bar to get your fix with sushi if you're not looking for anything over the top.\n\nCame here twice with a group of friends who sat in the dining area and with a friend who sat at the bar. Both times seating was ready and available. Waitresses were nice and so were the chefs at the bar. The only dispute I have is with the miso soup. Way, *way* too salty for its own good. Everything else tasted great, though. Even though Island Sushi is A-OK, I wouldn't mind stopping by here again if I'm in the neighborhood."
1,"As a former paintball enthusiast I would not recommend this park to anyone who takes the sport too seriously, however, this is a great place to go and try out the sport for the first time or to take your kids.\n\nThis business operation is pretty small scale which is great in some ways and a major disadvantage in others. I will do my best to explain below.\n\nCost: This is a very affordable way to spend the afternoon with the family or friends if you plan it out right. I would recommend using the Groupon that is available online. The deal covers 4 people's admission fee of $20. If you need to rent a paintball gun and the gear it will be another $27. That includes a gun rental, hopper, air, air tank, protective vest, and 500 balls of paint. A great deal! You can spend a whole day here if you buy another box of paint and bring a cooler with your water and lunch.\n\nCourse: Most of the bunkers here consist of large cable spools, barrels, and plastic tubbing. There was plenty of bunkers available and space to move around the course even with 40+ people playing in a single game. These types of bunkers are fairly cheap to obtain but did not provide players with a lot of variety. I felt very uncomfortable with the rusting vehicles that are on around the course as it would be easy to injure yourself during a game. The course also lacked any clear definition of boundaries. A player can pretty easily find him/herself out of bounds with out knowing it. The ground is a very fine sand that can very easily get into your shoes. This is more annoying than it is a problem as it does not effect the game play at all. It was actually nice once the game started and one could knell easily on the ground without it being too hard on the knees. At the center of the course there is a makeshift temporary structure with several rooms. This is a great place to post up during the game, but is also super difficult to hold. It's pretty exhilarating to move from room to room here.\n\nOperation: This would be my biggest concern with this park. The refs on staff are in charge of deciding when the games will start, how teams will be separated, and what type of game will be played. Some of the game types are not very clear as to how the rules work and the refs were not very friendly while explaining the rules or organizing the teams. The waiting between games was the worst part of the experience. There were sometimes 10-15 minute waits between games. This might not sound like a lot of time, but when you are paint balling, geared up, and ready to go having to wait another 10 minutes before play is a killer. Then by the time everyone made their way over to the entrance and teams were organized it had been 20 minutes. My group was there for 3 hours and only were able to play 5 games. I would love to see these guys move things a little bit faster if I were to ever come back. It really bothered me that the refs were just chilling in the shade and smoking during between breaks when I wanted to get started. There is a lot of room outside of the course for players to put down their belongings on wooden picnic tables. There are only port-a-potties available on site as restroom facilities.\n\nGameplay: 90% of the people here were utilizing the rental guns. These guns were terrible. It was clear that they had not undergone any maintenance or cleaned in a very long time. The velocity they were calibrated at did not even allow most of the paintballs to burst upon impact. There were many times when I had been shot and the ball did not burst at all. I often found myself in a shootout with an opposing player and our guns were so inaccurate and under powered that neither of us could hit one another. The low velocity would be good for kids because it barely hurts to be shoot, but it completely detracts from the sport of the game."
2,"i would go 3.5  They were 2 for 1 thanks to the Yelp mentioning(Thanks Yelp)! The Thai Calamari was excellent and would go back just for that that. The burger was just average, nothing that blows you away. I had the juicy lucy with some adding on top. I would take in and out any day over this. Service was perfect once we were seated. We did stand waiting to be seated for like 5 mins."
3,"pho here is the best on the southwest side of town. ive been to many pho places around town this one is definitely my favorite. the bowls here are big but i eat alot so i actually ask for extra noodles. ive had the potstickers, chicken wings, egg rolls, spring rolls, pad thai. porkchop and rice, egg wrapped fried rice, rice vermicelli bowls and obviously the pho. the pho is my favorite here followed by the fried rice. my only complaint is the checking out service is super slow. when its somewhat busy it takes the server a little while to get me my check. but other than that i definitely choose this place over jennipho. that place is no good and they dont take card. thats a demerit in my book."
4,"This place reminds me of Chipotle, BUT BETTER! Everything about this place was a great experience. The food, the employees, and cleanliness. The salsa bar is delicious and the good is all fresh. I'm definitely coming back!"
4,"Granted time is of the essence, but the Staff at RiRa handled our group of 19 on a thirsty Thursday evening with ease!  Don't let uptown parking scare you away from crashing this party, with the Discovery Place parking deck just blocks away RiRa is very accessible for those not living Uptown."
3,Great place to light up a cigar.\n\nThey have a Davidoff store on the floor to pick up a cigar in case you did not bring one.\nHead over to the EyeCandy Lounge and light up your favorite smoke.\n\nI was there for a convention and there was at least 5-6 other smokers. Glad to find a cigar friendly casino.
2,"Horrible Food, Excellent Service. Food served ice cold."
0,"We got ripped off!!!! I went here last Saturday night. The price in the menu for hookah is $25. When we went to pay our tab, the owner said it was $20 each, including the person in our party who did not smoke and only had water. Not only were we deceived about pricing, the service was mediocre, if not below average. Don't come here."
0,I just ate here and it was horrible. The bartender was to busy to take our order. My husband had to call him over. Finally I got a drink but he forgot my husbands drink. We then ordered food. My food was to burnt to eat. The bartender asked if I wanted them to replace it but I wasn't willing to risk spit in my food. If they have such horrible food and service they will spit in your food. Don't eat or drink there!  U r warned!!
1,My family and I love D&B but today the upstair sitting area to eat was horrible service. They had like 8 tables free but all dirty and not cleaned up from previous customers. We are sitting here watching no service anywhere. We are still sitting here after 20 mins with no service at all. Talked to bartender twice now to get us a server seems they cant find one either.
2,"This place is alright.  There's really nothing remarkable to say about it other than when I asked for a Diet Coke to drink, the girl gave me two glasses and kept them constantly full.  \n\nWhen we came in, it was pretty busy and we were quoted a short 10-15 minutes.  We waited for a bit until we heard that the \""bar\"" was open so we made ourselves comfortable there.  The menu is really big and honestly, too hard for me to look at.  The print is pretty small.  I decided to keep it simple since pretty much everything on the menu seemed to have stuff I don't like in it.  I chose the Belgian (not Belgium people!) waffle with a side of bacon.  The waffle was okay.  It was filling and tasty, but it was lacking that crisp exterior that makes these big waffles so good.  The bacon was a little overcooked for my taste, but not bad.\n\nI probably wouldn't come back unless we were absolutely starving and happened to be in this area because places like this are pretty much a dime a dozen."
4,"I recently went to Pittsburgh for a conference and ate at Sonoma Grille.  Boy was I impressed!\n\nWe had 8:30 reservations, so the walk to the restaurant was cold and dark.  I walked in and immediately felt a little warmer.  The walls are painted in warm colors with murals on some walls.  I felt like I was walking into a Tuscan or California restaurant.  (Though I do admit that it kind of reminded me of the Olive Garden, ugh.)  \n\nThe restaurant was farm-to-table.  Everything was extremely flavorful and fresh.  Price-wise, it seemed reasonable for the portions and the quality of the food.\n\nWhen traveling, I always try to look for basic food (since I never know the quality of the restaurant.)  I saw the menu and went--huh?  Many of the foods mix flavors and ingredients that I would never think to combine.  For example, we had the pecan crusted haloumi--fried cheese that was encrusted with pecans and placed upon a bed of a jalopeno potato puree with mango avocado salsa in a blood orange reduction.  Like I said--Huh? \n\nThat being said, I was incredibly impressed with all the food.  The pecan crusted haloumi was a favorite appetizer at the table.  We all tried to be polite and take small pieces of it, but I'm pretty sure any one of us would have been happy to devour the entire plate.  Similarly, the med plate, with hummus, feta, sun-dried tomato, and hearts of palm, quinoa tabbouleh, olives, and pita, was delicious.  The hummus was probably the best hummus I've ever had.\n\nThe tempura shrimp was solidly good, though not as memorable as our appetizers.  Like I said, completely fresh.\n\nThe time between our appetizers and entrees was a bit long, but the restaurant was packed with people from the conference.  I left completely full and happy.\n\nI can't comment on the quality or prices of the wines, but I noticed they had an impressive selection.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"
3,EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD! The fishbowl size margaritas are bound to get any night started on a good note. Their fajitas are my favorite. I think I have had em all. If you are nearby you MUST stop in and have a bite or a drink. The staff is always welcoming!
2,"It's hard not to give this place and extra star just for sentiment. Honestly Ritters is a favorite of mine. I love diner food. If you're looking for a late night, drunken fourth meal, this is your place. If you just want a no frills, greasy spoon, Saturday brunch, Ritters is there for you.\n\nThis place is blocks from where I live which makes it even better for me, and it is open 24 hours! One of the only places in town, or at least on the East End that holds that title. Perfect for those of us that frequent Bloomfield, Shadyside and Lawrenceville for late night fun. I can't tell you how many times in group of friends looking to satisfy their drunk munchies (or otherwise) in the wee hours that RITTERS!! is shouted. It's there, it's open and ready to serve you anything from it's extensive menu of diner food. \n\nIt's also good anytime, to go in and watch the old yinzers on a Saturday morning, drink their coffee, read the paper and just being so Pittsburgh. Served by waitresses in their nurse scrubs that always call you 'hun.'\n\nThe food - I have never had a problem with the food. I love breakfast and I don't think I have gotten anything else here. I think maybe my sunnyside eggs were undercooked once - but that has happened to me at really nice restaurants too, and eggs just seem to be something that is done wrong fairly often. I think their hotcakes are pretty darn good and that is my go-to meal. A great hangover cure, always."
2,"I would say Jun's is not my favourite Korean place.It is just quick and the service is good. I go to this place because it is close to my house sobI don't have to go to China town or I want something quick. However,I still would recommend it to anyone who live in the area."
1,"Mystere by Cirque Du Soleil is the longest running Cirque show in Vegas (since 1993) and it's age shows, it feels tired compared to the others. There isn't a storyline, it's more an exploration into the strange and unusual with slap-stick humor and antics to break up the circus acts.\n\nThe arial acrobatics are still amazing.  All props to the athleticism and showmanship of the performers, and it's the cheapest Cirque ticket, so if you're not sure you'll like the Cirque experience, it's a more affordable way to check it out."
3,"Let's be very honest here...this ain't a New York Deli like it claims to be, so don't expect the second coming of the Carnegie or Stage Deli (Stage Deli in NYC is sadly no longer in business)...with that out of the way and on record I will still say that I was pleasantly surprised with Zoozacrackers and will gladly return again.\n\nService is very basic and a tip is not required as you stand in line to order to have your meal delivered to your table shortly after.  I had their pot roast and being from North Carolina where pot roast is a mastered art I was very impressed and thought it was very good.  Looking around at other patron's dishes their sandwiches and soups looked very appetizing.  \n\nIf you are in need of a quick snack, or a bite to eat to hold you over through a show and/or until your 9PM dinner reservation this is a perfect spot to hit up, not to mention it offers a good break from the Casino!"
2,"I've been here a few times, overall decent experience, the put effort into the decor of the place, the way the place is decorated gives it a cool factor.  It's similar to going to a Mexican chain place for a burrito or salad.  Ingredients are fresh, The service is ok at best.  I can't understand the staff, heavy accents, it has potential to be homey and more hospitality driven, just not there yet."
2,"Food was good, waiter was a n00b though, messed up our checks and didn't really check on us.\n\nI'd put a two star, but the food was good."
4,I am a Chinese and I know Chinese food.  I was a Chinese chef before wile I was in College.  This is the place for Hotpot.  The buffet is OK.  The soap in the half and half pot (half spicy and half not space is excellent).  They use Chinese herbs like the expensive hotpot places in Hong Kong.  There are a lot varieties of vegetable and seafood and meat.  It is $20 with free drinks and worth it because it is a Buffet.\n\nThere are better places for Chinese buffet.  This is the best Hotpot place in Arizona and comparable to a lot of Hotpot places in California\n\nHK
3,"Lovely, bright caf\u00e9 with a relaxed and friendly vibe. I stopped in for lunch and had an amazing sprouts salad, which was served with two slices of toasted homemade bread. I thought it tasted amazing, and 3/4 of the way through I saw the dressing hidden behind the bowl, added it, and the salad was even more amazing with the dressing. \n\nI branched out a bit and tried the lavender latt\u00e9 ... ce n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt. Next time I'll stick with the standard kind. I was intrigued by the chocolate chai latt\u00e9 but it wasn't available dairy-free, so please try it for me and let me know how it is.\n\nTheir baked goods looked delish but I had used up my budget on lunch & coffee. Another time."
2,"One thing that sticks out to me for this theater is a color:  PURPLE.  Looks pretty normal on the outside, but when you go inside, it's like Barney exploded all over the place.  That paired along with the neon lights make it pretty unique... but almost spaceship-like inside when you are walking to the theaters.\n\nThis is a decent theater to see a flick... the seats aren't the most comfortable, but what you are paying for is the screen.  Have not had the pleasure to experience an IMAX movie here since it got converted - sounds like the options to watch in 3D and IMAX can get pricey though from the fandango website.\n\nI actually used to work here when I was in highschool (summers)... so that pretty much ruined the concession stand for me."
2,"OK. So apparently some yelpers think reviewing chain or fast food restaurants is gauche. Well, bully for them. To each is own right. Me? Sometimes after a 12 hour day at work my empty stomach gets home to an empty fridge. Papa John's is open til 1AM. Hey, for Phoenix, that's pretty damn good. And while Domino's crust is similar to the cardboard disc that a frozen Tombstone sits on and Pizza Hut dough has more yeast than a yeast infection. Papa John's drives it home. Literally. Tangy, sweeter tomato sauce with crumbled, non grizzled Italian sausage and a perfect amount of cheese on a thin crust. My tummy was happy. I ordered it on line at work and when I got home I waited about 10 minutes before Papa showed. But I have my own name for him. I call him Daddy John. Oh yea. Thanks Daddy!"
0,"Terrible place!  Do these folks even have a license or insurance?  Serving food without a food handlers license or health inspection?   The condition of the horses is borderline abusive.  Don't think that you are helping the horses by patroning this place, you are just putting money into the pockets of folks who see these horses as another object to scam money.  If you want to ride horses you are better off finding a licensed riding facility where educated trainers teach you how to ride in a safe environment."
1,"I ate here last night with three friends. The concept - an upscale bourbon and wine bar/pub - is great. As is the design of the restaurant. The interior is cozy and the patio feels spacious and light. \n\nThe execution of the concept, however, was lacking. The waitstaff were clearly selected for their appearance rather than competence. It took our waiter 3 long trips back to the table and about 20 minutes to figure out which wine (on the menu) my partner ordered. (Somehow he managed to confuse rose with champagne.) Just write orders down!  \n\nThe cheese plate was good. The mac and cheese was OK; not amazing. My pulled pork sandwich was good, but came on a huge tray with my side piled up in a small bowl, which made for awkward presentation. The salads were huge; several times larger than the sandwiches. The bourbon flights are definitely the highlight. I would definitely recommend trying them if you're into bourbon.\n\nWith some more training of the waitstaff, this place could be very nice. But you think they'd work that out before the restaurant opened. \n\nI might definitely come back for a few bourbon flights with my buds, but will not try the food again for a while."
2,Average across the board!! The food wasnt bad but it was bomb.com or what I was expecting from some of the reviews!!
2,"I wanted to love this place I really really did. I mean come on they have fired pickles!\n\nBut when Fried Pickles were the highlight of the meal it's not a good sign, afterall their name isn't Smash Pickle.\n\nThe burger was OK, I've had better, the way they prep them is a little odd, They take black angus beef and slam it onto a hot griddle, it's all smooshed down, and while the crispy char on the outside is nice, the burger came out a little dry for my liking.\n\nThe fries were nothing great, and as I stated earlier the Fried Pickles were the highlight of the meal.\n\nThe place is quite small, and even after bussing most of the tables were still drity. \n\nIn a city with a million burger places you need to do something to stand out and I don't think they did."
2,"Revised review: I posted the original review (and the picture of the inept front desk staff) from the waiting room. The woman who performed my echocardiogram (Wendy) immediately apologized and promised to address my issue. That made me feel better. \n\nI had kind of forgotten how much I liked Dr. Loli until I saw him after the test. He promised me that the issue would be handled.  I believe him.  My point was and is that patients are people. Some of us can sit in a waiting room all day, some of us can't.  Front desk staff clearly knew the technician was running behind, but no one told the patient. If I had that information up front, I would have been far less irritated. \n\nThe original review:  The office staff are totally inept.  If the testing person is running 30 minutes behind, why not tell the patient instead of letting him fume about the wasted time spent in the waiting room?  The response of the front desk staff?  \""I wasn't the one to check you in.\""  You can be assured I will find a new cardiologist immediately. (That last sentence is no longer true.)"
2,"I have a hard time feeling okay with paying $25 for a plate of food in a crappy strip mall in the hood. I wasn't ready to drop that kind of cash so I got the chorizo sandwich for $6 and it was not enjoyable. With that said, I'm biased toward Mexican chorizo which I adore. Just not at all what I expected."
2,"I think if the walk up counter was gone this place would do a lot better. Waiting in line was not too fun. The person in front of us had a larger modified ticket and was totally annoying to listen to..we  did tip the counter staff and server. We were approached too many times asking if everything was \""good\"" . Burgers were good but first basket of fries was a pile of crumbs. For $6 a basket, there should be fries not crumbs. They were replaced fast but the guy did look offended. I think the service staff really reallyyyy wanted to make a impression so they would get tipped. ( kinda like a buffet, servers hope they get something ) Six plus times asking if something was \""good \"" was overboard. I think if it was just a regular restaurant without the counter it would keep\nThe servers more busy and they would not be stressing if someone was going to tip or not. I do not like being interrupted every bite I take lol. \n\nBurgers were good so don't worry on that part!"
2,"I went here recently after a night at Four Peaks Brewery, also in Tempe, and had already downed an 8-beer sampler. Let's just keep that in mind while reading this review, shall we?\n\nThe interior is stunning, as most wine bars are. Apparently when the owner bought the place, they just started axing at drywall til a miraculous brick came through, and voila! Insta-charm. Also insta-mark-up, unfortunately. But honestly, if I was just paying for pasta here, why else would a plate of risotto with no meat cost 18 bucks? There is no reason. No reason at all.\n\nThe cocktail menu is pretty impressive, though--why do wine bars always have bartenders who outshine the wine with herby sophisticated concoctions like rosemary-muddled pear ginger cocktail  with prosecco or basil-infused sangria? I guess both of those do include wine, though...\n\nMoving on! The place gets fresh bread baked for them daily, and the waiters bring around a selection for you, rather than just dumping a wasteful basket on each table. I liked that little touch. Plus the olive oil-hummus-green olive trio that comes with it is a nice change from just straight EVOO. \n\nThe heirloom carrot soup with pumpkinseed oil is pretty good, and apparently changes color daily based on what the bulk of the carrots look like. The risotto and fettucini were great, as far as those things go. But ultimately, it's 20 dollar pasta, which the mere idea of kinda turns me off. \n\nThe place is cute, the staff is nice, and the music selection had some Radiohead and the occasional deviation from jazzy elevator b.s. you get in wine bars all too often. If you're looking to escape the college town vibe without straying too far from ASU, this place is probably pretty great."
0,"This place needs some work. Waited 10 minutes for someone, anyone, to pay attention to us at the counter.  No one even acknowledged us.  We left. Won't be back."
4,"We love it here!  Love the coffee.  I really appreciate getting a mug instead of a to-go cup.  The oatmeal w ginger, blueberry, and almond is lovely.  Today's lentil stew was perfect. \nWe will be back and back and back."
4,"We arrived without reservation, but luckily grabbed a table for two by the bar. This restaurant is tastefully decorated and not lacking for details. Out server greeted us and let us know the sommelier was present should we have any questions. This a tapas-style restaurant and our server suggested 2-4 plates a person. The two of us shared three plus a bottle of wine and dessert and were definitely satisfied. Our first two plates were a variety of five tomatoes with truffle oil and the duck and arugula. Both were absolutely fantastic! To follow we had the beef cheek. I dont have words to describe this dish. The beef was melt-in-your mouth delicious while the sauce it came with begged to be sopped up by bread which soon followed - two types to be precise. \nOur dessert (although not necessary) was a strawberry shortcake. This dish was just ok, but it did have to follow those beef cheeks. I would have had those for dessert.\nOverall, I would recommend this restaurant, but be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment."
1,"I have been to Todia's in San Diego, Seattle and Las Vegas.  Each time I always get what I am looking for.....lots of sushi and sashimi for a decent price.  While I do not have expectations of super high quality I am always satisfied....until my last visit to the Las Vegas Todia in November 2012....the place was over crowded with long lines to get food and plenty of ignorant people that did not feel they needed to wait in line like everyone else.  These people sadly were all the same nationality and would just push in staring and not speaking english.  It made the entire experience frustrating and also seemed to reduce the selection of the \""good\"" stuff.  Then the ultimate shock came after having to endure long lines and ignorant patrons we were dropped a bill that ended up being $47 each......seriously....I have not paid that for 2 at Todia in the past.....never again will I get burnt by them and I suggest you save yourself the pain....if there is one thing Vegas offers it is dining choices and I am certain you can find a much better sushi place for less money...."
1,"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork. The corn souffle was good but the potato salad tasted like mediocre store bought. For the price I expected much better."
1,"The room was visually appealing with it's Old Hollywood style decor complete with cinematic reels on the ceiling, but we were seated near the too noisy bar area and the all too frequent arctic gusts of wind detracted from any sort of comfort level.\n\nSoon after we were seated \""our drinks\"" arrived, how cool is that (not the arctic wind blasts) but that they could read my mind without taking my order first.  It actually took some more than necessary convincing before our waiter finally relented that we did not in fact order those drinks, nor had we ordered anything yet!\n\nWhen our cocktails did arrive, the uneventful HillBilly beef brisket infused Bloody Mary was accompanied by a wedge of last week's dry and tired lime, The Lonnie martini was fortunately garnish-less and pleasant.\n\nOne of the things that generates a vast culinary sadness in me is an bad bread experience, and what arrived was a whole basketful of it.  What should have been delectable bacon & cherry bread, baguette slices and Parmesan crisps, were horrifically stale apparitions of their former selves. There is never an excuse for stale bread.  NEVER!\n\nWe had:\n\nLukewarm French onion soup, which was tasty, but not exceptional.  \n\nFree Range Chicken with mushroom risotto, nueske bacon, and baby mustard greens.  The chicken was overcooked and dry, the risotto was pasty and fair.\n\nShort Rib Bourguignon. Meh.\n\nWe did not have:\n\nThe side dishes we ordered which never arrived.\n\nFor dessert we rushed to Trader Joe's to pick up some sweets to comfort ourselves at home.  There is just so much disappointment, mediocre food & poor service one can endure."
2,"Not too sure why this place has such a great rating. \n\nTables are greasy. Sushi is only average. Service was SLOW as hell.\n\nI spent 2 hours at this place and was only able to get 2 rounds. They never even finished making what we ordered during the 1st round, and this was when there were only 4 tables in the whole restaurant. Literally, dishes came 1 at a time with a span of like 20 minutes in between. Luckily, there was a tv showing a documentary of a Japanese sushi chef or else we would have fallen asleep. We were able to watch the entire documentary while waiting for our food.\n\nSo, thank you Mr sushi chef who spent his entire life devoted to his restaurant!! If it wasn't for you, my $21 would have definitely gone to waste!"
3,"Gorgeous room.  Decently priced for what you get (huge bathroom, kitchen, living and sleeping areas in the studio, and a balcony).  5 minute walk to the Palms to get to the exciting places.  Only problem is the pool is not very happening.  We just took the walk and enjoyed the people and service at the Palms.  But if you're looking to get away from the majority of the tourists and crowds, staying at the Palms Place is a superb idea."
2,"I expect this to be bumped up to 4-5 stars upon my next visit.  I just stopped in for a quick snack as I recently just moved to the area.  I'm liking this walking thing I've always heard people talk about(I'm from the lake area).\n\nI got the fries with garlic herb and truffle oil.  It was a decent pile of fries and they were good, but nothing special.  I know truffle oil rarely contains any truffle, but I tasted none.  The herbaceousness of the salt was the saving grace.  The fries them selves were small cut but fried about to perfection.\n\nService was awesome.  A thoroughly pierced server with green hair was quite attentive and always kept my cucumber water filled, even after it was obvious I was just there for some quick fries.\n\nThe local is great, the ambiance is quite nice.  The fact that they have this beautiful sushi and tapas menu that serves till midnight and is stumbling distance to home makes this place a must for me in the near future."
0,"Food is okay. Was sandbagged with a $27 bill for a steak and fries bowl, and sandwich. Careful when ordering!!!!"
4,"Great New York style pizza by the slice for a decent price on the strip... The pepperoni pizza was awesome with the crust being the best part. It is kind of hard to find as its location is \""secret\"" but this just adds to the fun if eating here. There really isn't much seating in the restaurant area but it's adjacent to plenty of comfortable seating in a lounge area of the resort."
3,Very good food.  Beyond excellent service.  My only complaint was that my Croque Madame was a little overcooked on the outside and I couldn't really taste any cheese on the inside.  Otherwise everyone else in my party raved about their meals and I loved the chocolate mousse dessert I had - It wasn't an actual cup of mousse but like dark chocolate mousse was packed into a loaf pan and sliced into servings.  It was supposed to be orange flavored but all I could taste was chocolate deliciousness.  I was totally fine with that.
2,"I came here on a Thursday at noon w my 4 year old. It was pretty busy mostly with what seemed to be business employees from close by offices. First impression, a friendly girl greeted me at the door to tell me the house favorites. A nice gesture but could be skipped in my opinion since I can read the menu myself and none of the house favs appealed to me at all. An over abundance of (friendly) staff behind the counter took my order and I received my lunch immediately. They offer samples of all of their 10+ soups which was nice. The salmon chowder tasted good but when I dug into my bowl I was disappointed to find it VERY thin w zero bits of salmon or anything other than 2 or 3 bits if corn to be found. In fact, I easily could have drank the entire bowl w a straw. Bummer for a chowder that they compare to the ones found in Washington State!\n\nMy Thai chicken salad was alright but nothing to write home about. It had very few small pieces of chicken in it, all iceburg lettuce. I did liked the fresh mango, peppers and small kick of spice it had going on. \n\nSigns on every table tell you To Not Save Your Table (?) and I couldn't help but feel rushed to vacate mine with several staff hovering over us scoping out our plates. If you are looking for a fast, simple meal on your lunch hour this place will do. If you want to sit and enjoy your lunch, not so much. \n\nBottom line: above average customer service, average at best food."
2,"This is a pretty decent place for bar food.  They have a nice chicken breast sandwich, and oversize nachos.  I have found after eating many a lunch here while I was working nearby, that the quality of the food is a bit inconsistent.  The fries are decent and you can ask for a garlic aioli for them.  My wife would probably give them an additional star because she really like the sweet potato fries.  One good thing about this place is that it is great for a mixed group with lots of food idiosyncracies.  There are a decent number of veggie options, e.g., a mushroom sandwich."
4,"I eat here for lunch at least three times a week.  Since  have mentioned it to my co-workers, I have half my dealership getting sandw. from this place.  By far the best quality italian sub I've had since Fontano's in Chicago.  Trust me the deli is excellent!"
1,The food was okay but the service was terrible.  We waited two hours for our meal and some of the children were served last to be served.  Some of our favorite meals were discontinued from the menu.
4,"Me and my husband make it a point to come here at least 2-3 times per month. The consistency is superb. The pho and spring rolls are always on point and we have never been disappointed. You can really tell here that they take the time to build that slow and low flavor in the pho stock because it is so rich and developed.\n\nService is excellent and everything just tastes so fresh. Make sure you get the chili oil to add to your pho! It reallly adds a depth of flavor to your soup, along with a light heat but its more flavor than heat. I've only had the pho and spring rolls and fried banana dessert because theyre always so on point I am afraid to veer from it but I always see people around me eating a variety of things from the menu and praising every bite. Very reasonable and affordable prices and the place is always packed which explains the all star reviews. \n\nThis is a must."
1,"If you close your eyes and taste the food, there are too many items that are way too similar to TGIMcBennibees.  I've given it a few tries, and while I've finished my meal every time I'm not overwhelmed.   The best thing it has going for it is location combined with a big parking lot, and it gets bumped up to a third star because the menu does have some variety to it.\n\nIt's a perfectly safe choice for lunch when in the area, since the area defined by Whitney, Midvale, Nokoma, and Mineral Point is a bit of a wasteland if you don't have inclination to drive to campus/downtown or to the chains of Middleton.  The beer isn't anything special so you're not missing out that much."
3,An absolute gem of a place! I'm glad I stopped by after walking past it so many times. If you like fish then this is the place to visit. Lovely good and lovely staff! Highly recommend it.\n\nhttp://smgdesigns.co.uk
3,"I love family owned establishments. I just ate here for the first time. It was great!! By far the best Mediterranean food I've had in Phoenix. The quality of the service and food was excellent. The food was presented well, very tasty and enough portion size to leave me walking away stuffed. \n\nI was joined by my wife Carol, my 22 year old grandson Michael and our friend Kathy R.\n\nKathy R. had eaten here before. In fact she has been coming here for years. She said at one time or another she has tried everything on the menu and just loves their food. Today she ordered the Moussaka. Which she aid was toasty, & creamy.\n (Basically Moussaka is a lasagna without the noodles, the eggplant in it  adds the right amount of bitterness to balance out the great, intense flavor of the sauce.)Although I didn't try a bite it looked great. \n\nMichael got cheese raviolis and an antipasto salad. He didn't say much about either dish but they looked good to me. \n\nMy wife & I got the Pork Souvlaki (Tender chunks of pork served over rice). My wife ate her plate clean which she rarely does so I know she liked her meal. She told me when we got home she wants to go back there so that told me she really enjoyed the food.\n\nLike I said for my dinner entr\u00e9e I ordered the Pork Souvlaki . But before I did I  ordered a Greek Salad as a starter. It was much bigger than I expected for a side salad. The salad was very fresh. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were extremely tasty. I didn't know my entr\u00e9e came with either a Greek salad or  Agolemono soup. Since I had already ordered and eaten a Greek salad I opted  for the Augolemono Soup (chicken stock, egg lemon soup) my soup was absolutely  outstanding!!!! All meals  also come with a vegetable of  the day and homemade pita bread. You could tell the pita bread was homemade. It tasted fresh and came out hot. OMG it was delicious.\n\nI almost forgot with dinner Kathy R. wanted us to try the spaghetti with meat sauce so we could see what it was like. It was a small side dish. Kathy raved about it so I thought why not try it. My wife said she liked it and would order it. I thought it was just OK then again I grew up in Rhode Island in a very Italian neighborhood so it may have been good for a Greek restaurant but not to my taste. Back in Rhode Island the Italians and Greeks cooked many similar dishes including pasta dishes.\n\nFOOD: All of the food was great. The food was so good! I would definitely come back for more in the future.PRICE: . SERVICE:   \""staff\"" consisted of  a mother-\nsister-brother team.  The mom wasn't there today. The brother sat us and brought us menus. He was very friendly. The sister was our waitress and server, she was attentive and friendly.  AMBIANCE:  A cute little family owned restaurant tucked in a small strip mall. The atmosphere in the restaurant is lovely. It does look like it has been there for many years but the place is NOT as Nadia C, said \""Dumpy\"". \nCONCLUSION:  We were seated immediately. Food was excellent, service was spot-on. My recommendation: if you want authentic, come here for an outstanding dining experience!!! This is a very special neighborhood ethnic restaurant.TURN FACTOR: 100%"
4,"Solutions Specialties is AMAZING! Super friendly small-town feel, extremely knowledgeable staff, and they are 100% accommodating in working with other pharmacies when I'm on tour. I wouldn't go anywhere else in the greater Las Vegas area!"
3,"So, continuing on with my quest to find the best Chicken Fried Steak in Las Vegas [plus the fact that my friend had a Groupon], I finally got around to trying this place. \n\nAs we walked in, we noticed that they were already cleaning up the restaurant. Without realizing, we had accidentally come about half hour before their closing time. Feeling bad, we asked if that was OK and said that we had no problem coming back another day. However, they were more than happy to still have us eat there, which was nice [ I for one hate customers who come in an order at the last minute possible].\n\nNaturally, I ordered the CFS. For $10 you get the steak & gravy, two eggs, choice of potato, & choice of bread. The pricing was pretty decent. I got the apple fritter with mine, which I wasn't a big fan of. It was just too sweet for me. Maybe next time, I'll try the fried bread. \n\nAs for the steak - it was good. Cooked well, and wasn't chewy or rubbery. The breading on it was a little more thick than I prefer, but had good taste. And the gravy was decent. Wasn't the best I've had - but it sufficed. While this place isn't my number one favorite for CFS, I'd still come back for their other food. \n\nEverything was cooked well and had flavor and service was great. It's a great place to go for breakfast."
1,"The food is great! Only giving 2 stars because service has gotten worse each time we started eating here. If you don't mind being asked for your order multiple times, this place is it! But the food is really good though."
0,Left in complete disgust. Poor service and this location looks NOTHING like as described on the website. They did nothing to remodel and it still looks (and smells) like the rt o's that was here prior.
1,"I have used Silver spurs once 3 years ago and it was reasonable and great. This review is based on an inquiry I made.\nI called back to book another tour and they said they are no longer taking tours from the public, except it is a private tour. She said it will cost a lot for 2 people only. I wanted to go from Phoenix to the Grand Canyon. So I asked 'what about if I get 2 other people to join us. She said, it will cost me a little over $1000 each. I said $4000 for 4 or $4000 for 2 either way. I will use a different company that charges a lot lesser."
0,This place is mess-up. The food is typical KFC food when they have it in stock. It is hard to get original recipe.   The staff and management is totally useless. For the price the owner should get a better team to run this place.
4,"Probably the best on campus. They spray A LOT for bugs, which is awesome. They take care of almost everything right away. It's a family owned business and they do a great job. \n\nThe only thing that was  odd  was their payment plan. It was a bit confusing but just make sure to ask lots of questions."
2,"I've been here before, and every time I order something I'm more \""eh\"" about it. The basic hot dog is incredibly overpriced--$5 for one with nothing on it. The options with a selection of toppings are way better deals, at around $9 after tax. Pink's is pretty over-hyped though, either way. The hog dog itself was alright, and it did have a bit of the \""snap\"" that other reviewers mention, but the hot dog bun was definitely a letdown. It was cold and basically tastes like something you get out of a bag from the grocery store that's been sitting around maybe a few days too long--it's edible but just doesn't add anything at all to the hot dog. My friend had a few too many drinks, and even he knew better than to eat the bun, instead eating his hog dog and toppings with a fork and knife. \n\nOverall, it's a decent meal if you want to spend three times as much on a hot dog as you should, but IMO, Pink's is nothing to get excited about. I'd just as soon pick up a hot dog at Ikea and probably give it the same star rating. In Vegas, though, you're better off popping inside and paying the same amount (or less, in some cases) for an awesome sandwich from Earl's."
0,"How this place has such good reviews is beyond me. Where to begin? \n\nThe hollandaise on the eggs benedict tasted more like chicken soup than hollandaise sauce. The pancakes, which are comically large, are so sugary and mushy, adding even a little maple syrup nearly threw me in a diabetic coma (I'm not diabetic, either). \n\nAnd the place smells SO BAD. Obviously built sometime in the 70s, the owners opted for carpet. Carpet in a restaurant is always a terrible, terrible idea, as it soaks up everything, for all of time. \n\nI absolutely do not recommend Peppermill."
3,"I love this stuff!  I thought I didn't like Italian ice for some reason but this shit is good!  I got the red velvet and my kidlets got cotton candy, and Swedish fish.  They had lots of great flavors I didn't even know you could get in Italian ice like mint chip?!?  Can't wait to go back and try some of their other treats.  Rita's will def be in regular rotation for us this summer."
2,"This is the latest Starbucks to open up in the South Mountain area. It's in the center on the corner of 19th Avenue and Baseline, which is a logical spot to put a new location since the closest Starbucks to this particular stretch of Baseline is about 40 blocks in either direction (51st Ave and Baseline in Laveen or two at 24th Street and Baseline in Phoenix). I have been here quite a few times so far (I'd love to frequent an independent shop for my daily fix, but unfortunately, there aren't any in this area now, although one is rumored to be opening up in the new center at 32nd Street and Baseline) and found it to be decent as far as Starbucks go. The baristas are very friendly and the iced Americano (my drink of choice) is always made very well - the Americano at other locations often tastes too strong/muddy or too weak/watery. \n\nI'm only giving it three stars, however, because does not have a really comfy interior like a lot of Starbucks do (there are only a few tables and it doesn't have the comfy chairs or couches) and because it has a really small outdoor section (just three tables). It's one of the locations you frequent to get a quick drink inside or to hit the drive-thru. The stand-alone location at 24th Street (not the one in the Target) and the location at 51st Avenue in Laveen are much better locations for lounging and surfing online."
0,"Don't do it. I know, I know- the chef has been on Chopped. That's awesome, but the restaurant is not. The jelly selection is impressive (if not a little overwhelming), but the food is just...no. I ordered the corned beef hash and it had no flavor. I expected more than what looked like canned hash and tasted even worse. Could have been an off day, but I generally give places two tries because everyone can have a bad day; unfortunately for this establishment though, I'm not feeling that generous."
2,"Overall this show was too strange and expensive for me to fully enjoy.  As other people have mentioned, it is much more about dance than the acrobatics of other Cirque shows, although Love also relies more heavily on theatrical effects.  It's a very trippy show and I think at some point the creators mixed up abstract artistry with throwing a bunch of random-ass shit together.  For example, some burning questions:\n- why was the KKK at the carnival scene?\n- why were the Beatles in space?\n\nThe music was obviously good but didn't use as many of the \""upbeat\"" Beatles songs as I would have expected and if you're only going because you love the music, save yourself at least $100 and buy a Beatles CD.  If you don't mind completely incoherent things happening on stage while Beatles music is playing, then go for it - it's very neat - but don't expect anything to make any shred of sense.  That was my mistake.\n\nA few pieces of advice if purchasing tix though:\n- Be sure to check BroadwayBox.com beforehand to see if there are any discounts available - most tickets are priced $150 and $125 normally.\n- I suggest NOT sitting in the very first section (100 series) as there are quite a few effects from the ceiling.  The theater presents pretty good views from all seats\n- If you need to pick up tickets from the Mirage box office, go EARLY instead of right before your show - the line for pickup can be REALLY long an hour before a show starts\n- You get a 2-for-1 ticket for the REVOLution lounge at the Mirage from 8-10pm with each ticket purchased.  Offer applies only to well drinks, beer, and wine."
0,"I went here, the food was not good. The owner seemed very polite and friendly, and concerned over the economy. The placed appeared very clean and maintained inside.\n\nMy polish dog was overlooked on the outside, and raw in the middle. I forced myself to eat it, and regretted it later.\n\nI did like the presentation, the while tray and napkins neatly displayed on the tray. The tootsie roll on the side was a nice touch.\n\nThe cook was really scary looking. Three days later,  I accidentally stumbled upon his picture on Megan's List, he apparently lives somewhere near the AFB. I wasn't searching for this guy, but I am always paranoid and look at the app on my iPhone to be aware of my surrounding.  I can't believe I accidentally stumbled upon it. I really wish I hadn't gone there."
2,"Went here on a Saturday night with a group of 4 others. We had a reservation, and were seated promptly in the enclosed patio, with my back right up against a tower heater! But truth be told, it felt awfully good after the visit from the Polar Vortex we just experienced.There were no empty tables, and the bar seemed to be hopping, so they must be doing something right.\n\nThough I had been to Mallorca several times, which I'd always been luke warm to, I had never experienced their sister, next-door restaurant, and was game when someone suggested it. With a group, we figured it be fun to go with the tapas. And choosing from the menu WAS fun. \n\nFor the most part we stuck with the Tapas Calentas, or hot tapas, and shared everything. Each of us chose an item for the first round, and then another for the follow-up round. The grilled sardines with onions and peppers was quite good, reminding me to a lesser degree of those served in Lisbon. Since I'm watching my carbo intake, I avoided the mini crab cakes with blood orange, caramel and honey and the artichoke fritters with fresh garlic and olive oil. One of the nightly specials with shrimp in a chili lime sauce - good, but nothing special, which seemed to be the evening's theme. The fresh Prince Island black mussels in a provencal sauce was adequately sized for sharing, and were tender enough, but the sauce was somewhat nondescript. Sliced chorizo links were pleasantly spiced and oily as to be expected. My favorite of the night was a scallop dish, although as I'm looking at the menu I don't remember it being au gratin or with shrimp on a shish kabob. What struck a cord with me was how well they were heated, just enough to hold them together and heat them, but not enough so they chew like pea coat buttons. So rare in restaurants these days. The stuffed hot banana peppers with veal in tomato sauce were also good but, again, nothing to remember. The lone venture to the Tapas Frias (cold) side, we selected the Kobe beef tenderloin carpaccio in olive oil, which was quite tasty.\n\nThough nothing was awful, and the service was perfectly acceptable, nothing stood out. I'd be back if I was meeting friends again, probably the best way to go to experience the most variety, but I wouldn't go out of my way for that \""must have\"" dish that didn't occur."
0,"If only zero stars was possible.  After having my nephew for an appointment at Children's Hospital, we thought we would try Barrio for lunch.  We arrived at 10:55 to find that they were not open (according to the door they open at 11).  The doors were open as repairmen were walking in and out.  We stood in the parking lot until 11 at which time my sister walked in to see if we could be seated.  She was promptly escorted back out the door having been told they were not open yet.  After 5 more minutes of standing in the parking lot we decided to leave.  I walked in to tell them that they had lost our business.  The staff's only response?  \""Well, if you care to wait we'll be open in a few minutes\"".\n\nIncredibly poor customer service.  You never, EVER leave customers standing outside.  Is the food good?  We'll never know as I certainly won't try them again.\n\nMy suggestion?  Head around the corner to Juan's instead (we did!).  Not only do they open at 10, the family that run it is very nice and the food was fantastic...and CHEAP!\n\nSkip the Barrio hype.  WAY too many other great places to eat in that neighborhood."
0,"THE ONLY GOOD THING ARE THE DONUTS.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure they were Entenmann's brand that they just put in the buffet. The soda doesn't even taste right. It's way too sugary and not bubbly enough. Everything here is stale. I made the MISTAKE of buying the all-day pass. My friend conned me into it, saying how awesome it would be. (I'm looking at you SNFX). $24.95 to eat pieces of shit. Literally like eating pieces of shit. It all looks okay from far away but once you start eating it, you feel your life force floating away from you. I could literally TASTE the disgusting stick of butter in the fried rice. It was so disgusting. Nothing tasted right here. Worst freaking food ever. Seriously. Don't go here."
3,"I would like to start off by saying that the food was great. Our server a guy from Hawaii was so nice. I can't say that about the server next to me. Jenny. She was awful. I can not believe the way she talked to a guest. it was an elderly man, dining alone. Who I found out has been in the restaurant industry for 30 years. We were seated by the kitchen and I can hear her yelling at people. I know it was here because it stopped when she left and started when she went back. The worse part is that she may have been a manager since she had a different shirt on then everyone else. Which sucks because she probably won't even be held accountable.  I will be back but won't be seated in her station. I have been waiting tables for years and would never talk that way."
4,"Wow! I never even knew this place existed and now I can't wait to go back. My amazing girlfriend brought me here on our recent Vegas getaway. This is one of the best burgers I have ever had. Yes I just said that. One of the best burgers I have ever had and I have had a lot of them. I love cheeseburgers. I think I am ruined on burgers after this.\nIt is a nice place. One long bar with tables and some cool booths. I think it is great that they can text you now when your table is ready. No buzzer to carry around and if the wait is long you can wander farther away. It is a sign that this was the busiest place in this little area. There are a lot of other restaurants in this little area but this was the busiest. I now know why.\nYou can build your own burger and shake. Anything you want. Really anything. If you really go crazy you can get a $100 burger. You think that is crazy but I would say from the first bite you would say it was worth it. Mine came in about $20 and it was so good. From the first bite to the last. I didn't even get anything crazy. I just got an Angus patty, cooked medium, jalapeno bacon, Swiss cheese, a fried egg and their spicy ketchup. It is tempting to pile stuff on because you see so many toppings that you like but trust me 4 is enough. Too many and you have too many flavors going on and you overwhelm the burger. Mine was just about perfect. Cooked just right. It feel apart when you bit into it and melted in your mouth. The jalapeno bacon and the spicy ketchup had just the right amount of kick. Just what I was looking for.\nFor the shake I got chocolate ice cream with Oreos, hot fudge and mini marshmallows with whipped cream on top. The straw is huge. Almost hard to get your mouth around but big enough so nothing gets caught. It was so good too. Creamy and chocolaty. So good.\nThe service was great too. Water always full. They gave us time to pick out exactly what we wanted.\nI really can't wait to go back. We almost went back a few times but wanted to try other places. Guaranteed when we come back to Vegas this will be one of our first stops. For sure."
3,"This buffet is small but don't mistaken it because of the size of the restaurant. They also have special if you don't want to eat as the buffet. Not many variety of food but its still a great little place to grab some Chinese.  Will back again, hopefully he added more food."
2,"The Hilton, adjacent to the convention center, gave us some surprising issues upon check-in. Hubby is diamond with Hilton Honors and at 2:30pm, the front desk person tells us there was a 2-3 hour wait for a king non-smoking! what? FINALLY she digs around and finds one but of course its not set up for the honors perks - no big deal, but just a little strange that an honors customer is not accomodated correctly - they're the bread and butter of any outfit.\n\nThe room is good - updated with a garden tub and very comfy bed. Reasonably comfortable easy chair with a pretty large flat screen. Everything is clean and a nice view of the Wynn, Riviera and mountains beyond. We had to have maintenance in to replace one of the side tables - a panel of inset glass was shattered. The maid I talked to said she tried to report it but couldn't get through (?).\n\nCafe is OK - standard stuff. Haven't tried any other food here yet. Casino seems dated - low ceilings, dark - nothing special. Sports book seems to be the big draw.\n\nThe pool \""complex\"" is a total joke. Far too limited for a Vegas property of this size. The pool belongs at a Best Western. Only bother if you have to cool off. Not a happening scene at all LOL\n\nI will say all the service people here have been outstanding- polite and helpful.\n\nOverall a solid 3 stars."
0,"Trying the ribs here was supposed to be our office bonding experience. And it was!\n\nFirst, we bonded over skepticism about the food we got as takeaway. The ribs were fatty, the pulled chicken was flavorless, the beef was... odd. The only win was the cornbread, which wasn't too sweet and had peppers in it. The peach cobbler was proclaimed \""gross\"" by my colleagues with such vehemence that I didn't even try it. \n\nSecond, we bonded over a lively discussion of our symptoms in the subsequent days, as we (and none of our families or friends) enjoyed nausea, chills, severe stomach cramping, joint aches, and intestines that did not work as they usually ought. It was intense. Nothing forges that immediate sense of intimacy with a coworker like a good barfing story.\n\nSo while a large takeaway order from Ribshack probably did more for corporate bonding than a pricey workshop out in the woods with rope bridges and such, our unanimous decision is never to eat there again."
3,"I never thought I would enjoy Fatburger, because I typically am not a fan of the type of hamburger that is taller than it is wide, where you bite into it and about a pound and a half of condiments dump into your lap.  That's why in the eternal war of In-n-Out vs. Fatburger, I would take In-n-Out.\n\nBut for whatever reason, I really do like this particular giganto-burger.  There is the kitsch of the classic hamburger stand, the chrome signs and lineage behind the thing.  Add to that a very simple menu with lots of choices for your made-to-order burger.  And the ingredients are generally very fresh.  Some combination of that makes a burger that is a great experience, instead of just a placeholder next to a mess of fries.\n\nThis particular Fatburger is very hit or miss as for service times.  You can go in at three or four in the afternoon, or very late at night, and get your food in no time and find many places to sit.  Or you can go right at noon and be monumentally screwed.  This place doesn't scale well, so you might have to give up and move on to something else if you hit a rush hour.\n\nOh, and Mr. Pibb!  I always love that stuff."
0,"I needed a cab service on Friday 8/15/14 because my car was in the shop, so I called A Cab Service for my ride to work and things worked out fine. I decided to call them again for a ride home from work and I had the WORST customer service experience I've had in a very long time. Her name was Teresa and if I were over their quality dept I would send her back for re-training. Actually this company can't have a quality dept because she would have never been hired. She was so rude and condescending, then she hung up in my face. I decided not to give that company any of my business or hard earned money, so I called Western Cab Co at (702)382-7100. They arrived quick, the rate was fare and the driver was kind. Finally, thanks to Teresa I will never use this cab service again and if I could just have one person read this post, and not give business to a company who doesn't appreciate good paying customers, I've done my job. These companies need to remember it's the customer that keeps your company a float, and we do have other choices, without us you would be out of business, SO TREAT US RIGHT!!!"
1,I got in line at 11:30 AM for lunch and waited about an hour. The place looked elegant but I though with the pricey vegas entrance there would be more of a selection.  Desert was just okay. No crab legs on a sunday afternoon. I prefer Planet Hollywood or Mandalay Bay for a better taste of variety. plus mandalay on sundays have mamosas and crablegs for lunch.
4,The food here never disappoints (and we're self-proclaimed food snobs- quality over quantity!). \n\nOur breakfast go-to is the chicken & waffles- they do a good job with their take on this dish.
3,"Excellent food.  The service is typically good, but surprisingly -- not as consistently good as Soba and Casbah, which is curious.  Still, it's a favorite.  The chef's tasting menu with wine pairings is a treat.  The cocktails are excellent and inventive."
2,Not your normal Casino Coffee Shop.  Large menu for each meal.  Very good food served 24 hours a day.  It can get crowded but they do seat you quickly.
1,"My wife and I were really looking forward to dinner at RC. . . .but overall we were disappointed.\n\nLet me start out with some positives . . . the setting, our table by the window and our server were excellent.  Josh took really good care of us.  We found our server as well as other staff members to be quite attentive.\n\nI ordered a fillet and my wife ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare . . . . well, they didn't come out that way . . . they were more medium to medium well and the cooking was very inconsistent.\n\nWe both think it has to do with the cooking process . . . they boast that they cook the steaks at 1000 degrees and then bring them to your table on a plate that is 500 degrees.  But what happens is that the steak continues to cook on the plate so that when it arrives . . . it is medium well on the outside . . . and continues to get more done the longer it is on the plate.\n\nAnd what's with all the butter on the steak?  Both steaks were covered in butter and it pooled on the plate. . . .both steaks were a bit salty as well. . . . . the cut of meat seemed good . . . it didn't need all that butter and salt on it.\n\nThe sides are extra at $10 each . . . the baked potato was good and the creamed spinach was excellent.\n\nAs for the deserts . . . . the chocolate cake was excellent and the creme brulee was good.\n\nIn summary, we won't be going back to RC anytime soon as there are several steak houses that a much better and actually more reasonable . . . . to give just a few examples, I would rather go to Carve at Eastside Cannery; Fuego at the Fiesta; Hanks at GV Ranch; or one of my favs Hugo's Cellar on Fremont Street.\n\nLastly, before RC, this restaurant was called The Range.  I miss that place as it was much better than RC's.  Johnny the bartender was great too . . .but he left after he tried a month or two at RC . . . now I know why he left."
4,"My mouth is watering just typing this review. MMMMMM.  I had a chai tea latte (YUM) with the California Toast (To.Die.For.).  I also had the croissant breakfast sandwich (I give it a 15 out of 10... and I'm a math teacher.).  And my bill was cheap.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I WILL go back. *Highly* recommend."
1,"As I detailed in my first review, the pizza and wings here were pretty bad.\n\nI have since been back for their karaoke night and it was pretty fun. Apparently this is the new \""cool\"" hangout spot, or so I've heard. I guess they're hosting shows, etc. and really trying to make this more of a bar than a restaurant, which is cool since I didn't find the food particularly good.\n\nBUT...the bartenders here are HORRIBLE. I mean, they are really just bad bartenders, at least the two that were there the night I was there (and apparently are like always there). The one girl looked angry the whole time and wouldn't give me a straw for my cranberry vodka (seriously, who wants to drink well vodka without a straw?). She also gave attitude when my friend asked for a lime for her Tecate (again, who wants to drink Tecate without lime?). AND she didn't even open the beer, which I'm pretty sure is illegal (my friend has since been back and said that this is a common occurrence). The male bartender tried a lame attempt at flirting with me by continuously mentioning my bright red shorts. And then my friend's double gin-and-ginger-ale got knocked over literally a minute after she paid for it, and the bartender witnessed it, and he charged her for it!! I know the bartender's not required to comp you a drink or anything...but every time this has happened to me (most recently, at Mad Mex...I was talking with my hands a little too enthusiastically...), the bartender hasn't made me pay for a replacement drink. And I didn't have to ask, either. LAME!\n\nWeirdly...the pizza I saw some people eating looked nothing like the pizza I received when I ordered delivery from them. So maybe I did get a bad one, who knows."
0,This place is the worst. They take reservations and then you arrive and they refuse to honor it and say it's an hour wait for walk ins.
2,HOLY WIND BATMAN!! We decided to finally check this monthly event out... Plus YELP had a VIP tent happenin SO that was definitely a PLUS to get our butts downtown!\nTOO bad the wind was SO crazy that night that we couldn't really enjoy ourselves and made it an early night =( \nWe did get into the tent for a bit though (Hi Molly T.!) and got some good draaanks and yummy food and ran into some other Yelp friends - Shoutout to Christie L.! so that was fun. \nAnd I stopped by the Dragon Grille and got a little rice bowl that wasn't too bad at all! \nHopefully next time we go the weather will be nicer!!
3,"Healthcare in Vegas. 3 words that can make any of us from all walks of life cringe. For the most part Vegas healthcare has some issues. But there are exceptions to the problems, and for me Procare is one of them. \n\nYes, there can be a wait. Yes, you have to fill out insurance forms and they have to ask questions and collect a co-pay. Suck it up buttercup, it's how heathcare these days is. Once you get the front office satisfied I haven't had to wait too long, I prepare though by making sure my phone is charged or by bringing an iPad to keep me distracted while I wait. \n\nI've seen the nurse practictioners like Adriana, and I've seen Dr. Tran. I like them both. If you are looking for a mindless doctor or nurse to rubber stamp your request for a trip through the best of Big Pharma's meds, this is NOT the place you want to go. But if you want to talk to people that seem to actually give a damn as to what's going on with you and want to make you well vs. seeing you as another Lexus payment...this is a place to consider. \n\nLocation: Right off the 215 at Rainbow. Parking can be...interesting. The waiting room feels a touch on the cozy side. These are things that I usually grumble about but the care I've received makes me gladly put up with it. And yes the front office staff has to ask you questions and collect money, but I've found them friendly and good to work with on referrals or if I had questions. \n\n4 Stars. I'm being tight on 5 stars these days. But make no mistake, it's a strong 4 Star rating. \n\nOther VERY GOOD THINGS about Procare: They don't have Banker's hours..so you can be seen after work and not burn sick time. And they are open on weekends too while other doctor's office have crickets chirping. Health care issues don't always happen between 8 am and 4 pm, it's nice to see a practice that understands how the world works and has real hours that make sense."
4,"I love Lakeview. I'm terrible with names, so I'm not exactly sure of my vet's name. Either way, all of the staff is fantastically friendly and knowledgeable. I will never take my cat anywhere else. I understand some people's hesitance because of the higher expense. A few years ago my cat was having issues and I took him to Companion Animal Hospital because they were cheaper. On the first visit they said nothing was wrong with my cat and I left. Awhile later my cat started yowling in pain constantly, but with no visible thing wrong with him. My boyfriend and I took him back and paid for $400+ in expensive tests. Still nothing. They turned us away. I just didn't know what to do. A few days later I woke up to my cat peeing blood. My boyfriend made the call to take him to an emergency vet (Lakeview was closed). They diagnosed him right away and began treatment. They said if we had waited 12-ish hours my cat's bladder would have ruptured and he would have been killed. Now I will never hesitate to pay the extra.\n\nLakeview has been very helpful with managing my cat's medical problem. They're very knowledgeable and always know how to help. I find them to be very thorough in their regular exam as well. Those who scoff and claim thoroughness is an excuse to jack up prices, you're wrong. Lakeview really does check for more than others.\n\nMy boyfriend's family has also been going to this vet for quite some time. More recently they were amazing at helping manage extreme separation anxiety when my boyfriend and I were dog sitting. I also came with for emotional support when my boyfriend's family had to have their very old, lovable dog put down. Lakeview was truly amazing during the whole process. They even seemed emotionally attached to the dog. I've never been more sold on the quality of a business. I would recommend them to anyone."
3,closed down - hope they open close by - granted the guy behind the counter was awful but the food was tasty-not as good as precious owners (even tho same guy cooking) but it was still tasty.
3,The fried dumplings rock!
1,"Just an FYI, not many veg* options. Gravy isn't veg, but the pancakes are a little on the massive side. A little flavourless though."
2,"I ordered the D'Accrod crepe, goat cheese, spinach, mushrooms, olives, almonds. It was every good, came with salad or fries, or half and half. What a great option/idea, the half and half. Although the fries are battered. Why batter a perfectly good potato I'll never figure out.\nMy daughter ordered Cri D'Amour, coco hazelnut, banana, strawberries, it could have been great but the chocolate & strawberry syrup not needed. Strawberries were fresh why add fake strawberry syrup! Hazelnut was chocolatey why add fake chocolate syrup! I'll go back but make some adjustments."
2,"I don't understand why they eliminated their $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe meal and if I am correct, raised the price on fries in the middle of a recession. I do understand that it has alienated customers, such as myself.\n  Recently I had been eating here so frequently that I became the duke of this Wendy's. The employees are friendly and the dining area is generally clean.\n  I have lowered the rating by a star. Eliminating a good deal during a recession lowers my opinion of the place."
3,"A fun, sexy and hip place. Great food and entertainment including an acrobat and fashion show on Friday nights."
0,"Should have heeded all the signs warning us NOT to eat here: disasterous parking structure, nasty elavators (seriously smelled of death), having to journey to the outer recesses of the hotel to find the buffet, staff that barely acknowledged we were in front of them, then spending $30+ for a 'champagne brunch' that felt/looked exactly like a Hometown Buffet.  The smoked salmon was ok, but as I went to try to find anything else that looked even somewhat tempting my husband came and found me, insisted I put my plate down \""NOW\"" and follow him to the front to speak to a manager.  \n\nAs he explained the cockroach he had caught with a napkin as it crawled across his plate, he asked for our money back.  The manager asked if the roach was actually in the food or \""just on the plate\"".  She then explained the buffet had been fumigated the night before and \""that some pests were to be expected.\""  She asked if we'd be staying(?!?), when we declined she kindly refunded our money.  As she handed my husband his refund receipt she asked me if I was going to be ok.  At least the manager was nice, even if nothing or no one else was."
0,"I would give this place NO stars if I could. Went there for lunch with a friend when we were craving mexican cantina food (hoping it would be like paradise cantina). At around 11:45am it was still pretty empty so we were seated quickly and the server came over and took our drink order. He asked if he could sit down a few times which I thought was totally inappropriate seeing as he interrupted our conversation to ask. I was initially craving a taco salad of some sort but the only dressings they had to offer were Caesar and Italian. I was hoping for a more south of the border salad so I chose the chicken enchiladas (who doesn't love rice and beans and sauce!!) my friend ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. Our server told us that he didn't like our choices and tried to push us toward other (more pricy and larger dinner entree style) options. We explained why we chose what we chose and our food was delivered to us within 5 min. I'm not usually one to be negative about quick service but 5 min seemed a little microwaved or pre-cooked and warmed up to me. Regardless we thanked them for the quick service. We the dishes were put down in front of us my friends chicken sandwich looked good. Hot, crisp but thick french fries and a juicy chicken filet. My chicken enchiladas however were topped with a red sauce that tasted like a pizza sauce or thin marinara and then melted over everything was SWIS CHEESE. WTF?!?! I had my friend taste everything just to be sure I wasn't losing my mind and sure enough....italian red sauce and swiss cheese covered my enchiladas. SO WEIRD!! Needless to say I eat much of the enchiladas and was looking forward to the rice and beans but even they were \""rice a roni\"" style spanish rice and the beans weren't fresh or very good either. SO GROSS!!! \nThe busier was quick to clear our plates but that was when the quickness stopped. The restaurant was no busier than when we arrived but we had to wait 45 minutes for the server to bring us the check and another 20 minutes for his to run our credit cards. He about disappeared a few times. I think it's really sad when it takes only 5 minutes from ordering our food to receiving our food and then an hour to pay the check?! COME ON FLAMINGO....UP YOUR GAME HERE. THE PRICES ARE WAY TO HIGH AND THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE AND THE SERVICE WASN'T REALLY THERE."
2,"They're in the middle of remodel.  I stayed in one of the newly remodeled rooms and it was great.  Bed was super comfy, room was spacious and clean.  We had a nice view down (up? I'm never sure in Vegas) the strip.  The crowd is still a bit low-rent, which was a drag.  If they can keep things nice until the remodel is finished, this will again be a great place to go. The people  were all really great, except the cabana girl (her snotty attitude took them from four stars to three and cost them $)."
3,"The Pork Shop is a humble place with an amazing selection of pork. \nIf you are a fan of The Splendid Table and love the adventures of Jane and Michael Stern on NPR, this shop is a must do! Not only do they have green chili burritos to go but the menu is so large that unless you don't eat pork you can not leave without buying something. The Hot Italian Sausage is the best I have ever found. It is lean and flavorful and extremely clean tasting. The \""sticks\"" (think slim Jim's) are available it 8 varieties and they usually have them as a sample. The flavor, texture and visual aspect of them make them perfect for a snack or sliced for an appetizer. They even work well sliced the long way on a baguette for a sandwich instead of lunch meat. \nBacon, roasts, ribs, salami, you name it is all there in this clean, well lit and very organized shop. \nAs for eating there, you have a choice of picnic tables outside. I prefer the one under the pecan tree. If you like \""real Arizona\"" like it was 20-30 years ago in the east valley, this is the place."
0,Terrible place.. They charge for a buffet which hardly has variety. Waste of money. Save yourself from going there. On top of it the food tastes bad.
4,"I have been Dr. Tsai's patient for about four years now, and I love everything about his office and practice. I grew up in a family that never had a 'family doctor' and always spent hours waiting in Quick Care, but as an adult that really didn't appeal to me. Over the years I have seen him for a variety of reasons (trouble breathing, flu, cold, cough, head pain, check ups and lab work), and he always takes the time to listen and take me seriously. I recently wanted some bloodwork done just to check something out, which he ordered no problem. When I told my mom - a former nurse - she was so surprised that a doctor was willing to listen to what I was worried about and order the labs for me. \n\nThe absolute best thing about his office is how easy it is to get in for an appointment. Usually it is that day or the next day. My last visit was a 48 hour wait, and when I told him about it he was surprised, apologized, and asked me who I talked to. In office I usually wait less than 15 minutes to get in the room and maybe 5 minutes in the room.\n\nI also love that I don't have to fill out paperwork EVERY. TIME. I. GO. I did it the first time, and he keeps all files electronically (which means when I complained about a symptom that is new he was easily able to confirm that with his own electronic notes.)"
