3,"Everyone has already said it all.  Solid but unmemorable diner food, in a place that is divinely Vegas.\n\nIt's a must-see.  Ambience is 6 stars.\n\nThe rest doesn't matter much.  It's edible.  You won't get food poisoning.  Good drunk food alternative to Denny's.  Worth the trip even if it's out of the way."
2,"Who knew that there were so many different kinds of ice to be had in this town?  Shave ice, snow ice, and now, Fluffy snow.  I was intrigued by the coupon I got in a mailer that touted the stuff at Easy Life, so I ventured over there last night after dinner at Settebello.\nThere are three flavors available:  Thai tea, mango, and strawberry.  I ordered the small size with red beans, bananas, and condensed milk and it was plenty; I'm not sure I could handle a bigger size.  The best way to describe the ice is that it's a cross between gelato and sherbet.  I think I was expecting something more like the snow ice at Icy Juicy, which I absolutely love and to which I am addicted.  This was definitely heavier in consistency and tasted good, but I think I still like snow ice better, maybe because you can start with just plain snow ice and then add the flavors you want to it.  I wouldn't normally order strawberry, Thai tea, or mango gelato or sherbet, so there you go!"
1,"You get what you paid for, with that being said, why would u come to an all you can eat sushi joint?\n\nThe good thing is, they have a very extensive menu, the place was well decorated and service was exceptional the night I came here.\n\nNow the bad side, all the rolls/sushi is about 70% rice and 30% fish, fine I get that this is AYCE but the quality of the raw stuff is beyond bad, the sweet shrimp and oyster literally made me wanna puke, call me harsh but I'm from LA and my taste buds are spoiled.\n\nThe rice was hard and they give u plenty of that, I was also informed that if we left out any rice we would be charged, but after a few sushis I almost didn't give a shit cause it was so bad\n\nMy suggestions, stay away from the sushi or rolls, or anything with rice in them \n\nFor $26 per person u might as well suck it up and go to a real buffet. \n\nIf u must come, order yakitori, meat or the appetizer dishes, they're quite good."
3,"They finally corrected this Sam's Club with a much-needed remodeling.  Now it is just like all the other Sam's Clubs with the exception of a gas station, which is a drawback.  This Club is very nicely located, but may not have a large selection of parking.  This is also the first one in Vegas, built in 1991."
0,Really!! Uughhh!! Never again!! So we paid $13 for a taxi to take us to this place because according to yelp reviews these tacos are suppose to be the bomb!! Guess what!! They are crap!! My husband and I had carne asada and Al pastor tacos!! The asada has the fake grilled taste and the Al pastor did not taste like Al pastor it just had the Al Pastor color but no taste!! The tortillas are hand made but the meat that goes on top of the tortillas suck so no point in having hand made tortillas!!  Best thing there is the fountain drink!! I think all the people that say these tacos are good must go when they are drunk!! Because Everyone knows that any tacos taste delicious when your drunk!! So if your sober don't waste your time or your taxi fare!!
0,"Come in here spend money. Girlfriend has to use the bathroom and management says it's closed. So I ask them to open it and they won't, crazy to me thanks for nothing Walgreens!"
3,"Would you like to party with P.Diddy well who wouldn't and if you're with the star of  \""Stomp the Yard\"" Columbus Short, Danity Kane, and 3 of the pussycat dolls then you're sure to get in and have a great time.  After leaving the Empire Hellroom we jet over to the Palms for what is billed as the party of the night.\n\nNow when we got here there was no way that we were going to get into this party without slappin down $200 for the cover charge.  But luckily your boy Lovejoy got major celeb hookups\n\nI had no clue who was in town at the time, but when I saw Columbus and his entourage then it was looking pretty good.  We immediately joined the group and that's when actually Danity Kane (P.diddy's group)  Melody, Jessica, and Carmit from the PussyCat Doll's and Yung Joc and Ludacris all roll up and we all slip into Rain nightclub together and whisked to VIP to join Diddy's party.\n\nThis was the most exciting party we've been to which is why I didn't understand why we left, but everybody wanted to go see Tyrese and Akon perform so off  to Body Englsh we headed.\n\nLove the Rain!!"
0,"The \""Customer Service\"" here is a joke. \n\nI was tricked, and have been given the run around to get my money back for a transaction I cancelled in less than 24 hours. \n\nWhen I called back I was told that they were helping \""paying customers\"" and wouldn't help me with my credit. \n\nI go to Customer Service and can't be helped because I bought the bed at a store. \n\nI ended up saving $30 for the same mattress somewhere else, if I only saved $30 it's clear my issue isn't price it's Customer Service. \n\nI would suggest reading all reviews and knowing exactly what you are getting into before stepping into this place."
4,"I love Dim Sum and this place was close to where I was running errands. The other yelp reviews weren't too kind, but I went anyway. Although they don't have a cart and you just order off the menu, the food was great! The prices are reasonable and there's lots of flavor. I'd go back as the servers are kind and had great recommendations."
0,I was so disappointed by my dinner here!!! I had a chicken dish that tasted really bad.  The sauce was runny and had an odd flavor. Everyone in our party agreed that the food just wasn't good! It's quite pricey too. I will NOT be returning.  I feel bad for them because a lot of restaurants go out of business on Market Street.  They really need some help here!
1,"Cheap margaritas, good service but 0 for the FOOD!!! Salty, salty, salty and not good. Horrible Mexican food. Enough said. The chips were good though....green salsa, red salsa and BEANS!!!\n\nIt wasn't the waiter/waitress' fault for the taste...they exchanged my friend's meal twice free of charge! Thanks management!"
1,"I have to start with the garlic nan. My favorite part of indian cuisine is the nan. We oredered 2 orders of garlic nan and it was burnt. Not just a little over cooked, the whole bottom of each piece was black charred burnt. Completly ruined the meal.  The Tiki Masala and Vindaloo were both good but for the price...I can get just as good and bigger portions just about everywhere else. The prices were really over the top. You pay for rice and nan as well regardless of what you order. I did not feel like I had a $50 meal by any means and that is what 2 dishes, one \""small plate,\"" nan, rice, and one drink cost us. We were both just full but had I been with a guy or my step father, we would have needed more food for 2. \n\nThe atmosphere is great, the place looks really clean. The nan was so bad though that it ruined the meal and even if it was perfect, I still would have only given it three stars because the prices are just way more than everywhere else. I had more reasonable meals at the best indian cuisine restaurants in San Francisco!\n\nOur server was good, however, after our \""small plate\"" she seemed a little put off that we wanted clean plates for our meals. She did bring them and was nice about it but we shouldn't have had to ask. With all the sauces on the meals, mixing them would not have been good and our plates were clearly very dirty after the appetizer.\n\nWon't be back. Just not worth the price."
3,"LOVE District! A welcome addition to an otherwise dismal selection at the Arizona Center. We found all the food excellent except for the bread, that come from Simply Bread, of course that sucked. \n\nHighlights.. Shrimp Po Boy, Chicken Pot Pie, BBQ Pork loin, Tomato Soup, Pumpkin Whoopie Pie..\n\nLowlights.. chow chow (pickled veggies) and the bread.\n\nWell priced.. good price and a comfortable space that takes reservations!"
0,Garbage...I would rate food 3 but service brought it down to one....Garbage...go to suri ayce...rate Suri 3 but service brings in to 4
4,"Fantastic dining experience and an incredibly attentive wait staff. We had 6:30 pm reservations and chose to do try the 3-course Sunset Menu. I chose the waygu short rib ravioli, the phyllo- crusted sole and the candy bar dessert. We also ordered truffled polenta and brussel sprouts for the table. The ahi tuna tartare melts in your mouth. Each dish was more fantastic than the next. Make sure to put this on you agenda the next time you are in Vegas.  We left satisfied and raving about everything we tried. I love to dine all over the world and honestly this is one of the best meals I have experienced."
1,"Went here today for the first time with friends. The lady taking our order was EXTREMELY rude to us! She should not be working in the front! We were all so shocked by the way we were treated, it was hard to enjoy our lunch. Pulled pork sandwich was good, but will not be going back because of the horrible attitude this lady had."
1,had lunch there today with 2 coworkers. food was fine. the music was so loud we were literally yelling at each other.  LOWER THE MUSIC VOLUME at least for the lunch crowd.  Yikes... it was hard rock and it was LOUD!
4,"It was the first time I'd ever been to a HRC and it was incredible. Went in with my daughter about noon on a Tuesday, restaurant was empty  and Cody was our server. He was very attentive and personable, I've honestly never had better service. My daughter and I shared the bruschetta, Mac and cheese (without the roasted red peppers) and the hot fudge sundae. Overall I have no complaints, it was a fantastic experience."
3,"Bonnes tapas, bon vin, bon rhum, belle terrasse. :)\n\nC'est assez rapide comme r\u00e9sum\u00e9, mais parfois les bonnes choses sont les plus simples !\n\nPetit b\u00e9mol : C'est toujours, toujours bond\u00e9. Le revers de la m\u00e9daille pour les chouettes places ;)"
1,"WEAK&$$$.  If you don't want Alcohol then this place would be good. \n\nI got their \""Comfortably Numb\"" which is their version of a Miami Vice, $18 for a 32oz full of SUGAR..I drank the entire cup hoping to get at least a little buzz, I think I just ended up closer to developing type II diabetes.  \n\nGO TO FAT TUESDAY, add $1 for an extra shot of 151 or 2 shots and get your happy on!"
4,"The staff are friendly the food is excellent. Burgers, chicken, steaks and more; hot, delicious and freshly cooked to order.  Worth the visit."
0,"OMG- avoid for the time being... No Hostess, confusion out the Wazoo! Was this a soft opening with no workers what so ever that know what they are doing?? Wow! Wow... Who ever reviewed this place ... What were you reviewing? The fact that you were the only one there? Maybe u get service but talk about unprepared.. It was crazy! They had tables but no one who knew what they were doing on the floor- it was a mad house! \nWe checked Out! Didnt even get menus our water within the first 10-mins of siting there and watching the madness unfold-"
1,"I was excited and perplexed when I heard of Vegas' first gourmet food truck.  I spend a lot of time in LA and NYC and go out of way to find my favorite trucks and to check out new ones.\n\nThe slidin' thru truck is decorated very cool, comic-book panel-like.  I tracked it down in a Bank of America parking lot.  There were a few people there, but not many more than the crew I had assembled to meet up at the spot.  I was curious to see if the gourmet truck thing that has taken LA and SF by storm had a chance here.  This city is such a driving town, not many places where there is a high density of locals where a truck would be able to park.\n\nAnyways...  they had a surprisingly big crew scrambling in the kitchen.  The truck was clean and appealing in design.  I couldn't wait!\n\nUnfortunately I had to.  First, they were out of 2 of the 4 or 5 sandwiches they serve.  That was a bummer.  Once I ordered though the bummer got even bummier.  Took like 10-15 minutes to get the food.  There were more cooks back there than customers?  What gives?  My friends got there before me and ordered and were still waiting well after I arrived, parked, perused the menu and ordered.\n\nWell, if the food is killer it's worth it, thought I.  Finally got the grub.  Looked good.  It wasn't bad at all, just not that great.  I'd rather drive through one of the many In-N-Out outposts than wait in an out of the way parking lot for just okay food.  \n\nBun was a little stale.  Meat was seasoned well, but kinda dried out.  They obviously were sand-bagging patties back there, so why did it take so long for 3 cooks to put it together?\n\nI really have high hopes for the slider truck and any future trucks who take to the streets of LVNV, but I just can't love it because I know how good it could be and  it wasn't bad, but there are lots of good fast-food burgers a lot more convenient and a lot better.  Give me a Fatburger any day over the slidertruck.  I hate to say it.  I really do, but this one was a definite \""meh\""..."
4,"Every time I visit Las Vegas I cannot come back home (California) without going Lindo Michoac\u00e1n and have dinner. I have been coming to this place for 9 years. One of the thing I like about this place is when they sit you down they bring the tortilla chips; they make their own, with salsa and refried beans to complement that try their Fresh Guacamole Dip. They prepare the dip in front of you.  Another thing I like is they bring you sopa de fideo (Noodle soup); they make their own, before they bring your main entr\u00e9e. No other Mexican restaurant that I been to do that.  They also make flour or corn tortillas by hand. They have variety Mexican plates. The dishes have very good portion of food. They also have great desserts.\nWhen you come to this place read the history of Lindo Michoac\u00e1n on their menu. Lindo Michoac\u00e1n has interesting history. I highly recommended, check it out. You won't be disappointed."
1,"While the staff was friendly and the service very good, the prices seemed steep for what we ate.  The lobster roll was very small in proportion to others I've eaten around the city, and overwhelmed by the massive fries!! Crab perogies were a good portion, but bland.  Beer selection was great, and ambiance was cozy...very warm inside that day...felt sorry for our waitress."
4,I live across the street from this location and have been going here since 2003. Their food is so much better than your average bar food. I have taken quite a few pictures through the years of some of my favorites and added them on here. I absolutely love their wings especially the Jess Jess (Medium sauce with garlic and bleu chees crumbles) and the El Hefe (garlic and cilantro). I have tried so many of the menu items that I could go on and on. Everything is just so good here. They also have great beer specials all week. It's probably a good thing that they don't have NTN trivia here or I would be here all the time.
3,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that any foodie from India must be in want of good Indo chinese food. And Oh I have waited for that in Phoenix for the last 6 years I have been here. I have finally been rewarded. \nWe had a good dining experience last Friday when we went for dinner. The sweet corn chicken soup, drums of heaven and salt and pepper shrimp were all quite comparable to what you get back home. \nFor entrees, we had the chicken manchurian, chilli chicken and chilli shrimp. Unfortunately, all of the gravy, while tasty, tasted alike. Would have probably given a 3.5 star due to this but am feeling generous. The burnt garlic fried rice and hakka noodles was very good. They also have their sauces on the table so you can customize as you want. Serving size is decent. \nService and decor is very nice. \nTIP!!!  Please make reservations prior to going here, they either overbook on the reservations or are really busy. We walked in without a reservation and had to wait almost 40 minutes to be seated. \nWill return whenever the craving hits again."
4,"Went on Thursday night on a total whim.  I was in town for work all week and this was the last night.  We had been other places and @1 am decided to head to Hakkasan.  Most of the group bailed so we just paid for general admission (no line) it was mixed guys and girls, so I don't know if we paid the same or not (just gave a total and we threw in the money).  I had to pay $5 to check my \""jacket\"" it def went with my outfit and they said blazers and sweaters could stay on, but honesty it was so hot on the dance floor I am glad I didn't have it.   The place was packed and crazy party atmosphere.  Nervo was the DJs that night and they were awesome.  I had no problem getting and staying at the front, even after leaving to get a drink, but the dance floor was packed and everyone was having a blast! They were on until 3 am and we danced the entire time. I found out later a work group did get a VIP room and they said it was epic lol :) Next time my group will get a VIP table and go earlier, but for a complete whim, it was perfect night dancing."
4,"we were making a decision on where to go for a champagne brunch.  I read all the reviews and almost passed this place because of negative reviews.\nI am going to say that it depends on you.  If you search for a restaurant by who the chef is and what awards he has won nationally, then this isn't the place for you - actually no buffet is for you.  HOWEVER,  I AM a foodie, so I am a bit picky.  I want flavor and don't want it covered by salt or sugar.  \n\n     6 of us enjoyed the breakfast without any complaints. The omelet station was full of every option we could think of.  And the omelet cook had skills.  One of the group couldn't figure out what to add (so many options) so he suggested that he make him the omelet that he cooks for himself.  Excellent job!\nThey had 2 soups on the buffet - turkey and seafood bisque.  Generally a seafood bisque has no seafood - I was pleasantly surprised - and I commented that I would have been proud to have called it mine.  (and I make an amazing seafood chowder).\n     \n     The options for breakfast we as you would expect:  pancakes, waffles,salads, sandwiches, fruit, all the breakfast meats, fried chicken, biscuits and gravy and the rest of what you would expect.  \n\n     Right on the way to Hoover Dam - really - it is a light in the middle of the road to turn in.  And no wait at 12:00 on a Sunday afternoon.  The dining room wait staff was sufficient - her name was Miami Florida - she did just fine - I don't expect the Four Seasons service if I am not at the Four Seasons (their brunch is 40.00)\n\n    Didn't have room for dessert - (none of us could fit anything else)  so I'm not going to provide a review for them.\n\nMy goal is to let you know that if you are interested in having a low priced breakfast, even on Sunday morning - you will be well satisfied."
1,"I liked them a lot until I had to call them to get the discount fare for the toddler but since I was booking our tickets together (because a two year old legally can't fly alone so I HAD to) on the phone, I wasn't getting the lower internet rate.  That's extortion!  I'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  Then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  What the hell?  Why would I ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  Then they tried to get me to pay $15 more for the next class up (I know, upper class on Southwest - strange).  I asked what I got:  1.25 times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  I clarified that with a child I get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  Then I asked how much a drink costs.  $5.  So essentially they are asking me to pay $15 instead of $5 for a drink I may or may not want (then again, I'm traveling with a child so who am I kidding, I'm going to need a drink).  And to top it all off, they tell me we can't do on-line check in because Beckham doesn't have a picture ID.  I tell them but he does have a picture ID.  He has a passport, in fact he has two.  The Southwest person tells me no one has two passports so I tell him that no, it's true.  The toddler and I both have two as we have dual citizenship.  (Not that we would need them to fly to California so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now.)  The Southwest man being the all-knowing scholar he is tells me that's impossible and illegal.  I take a deep breathe, tell him he's right, I'm wrong, how stupid I am.  I must be thinking of my library card.    Why are things so difficult sometimes?"
3,"\""A wonderful evening and dining experience!\""  We were greeted warmly by the Assistant GM Jonas and offered a table on the patio, but opted for inside due to the Heat in July.  Misters were nice on the patio, but still wanted a cooler setting.  We sat in a wonderful high top table directly facing the kitchen and were able to watch all the amazing chefs create delicious looking dishes.  BTW.....try one of the meat or cheese boards.  :).  Our Server Kyle did an amazing job!  We started off with the steamed mussels in a savory wine and garlic broth with small amounts of Italian spicy meats.  Delicious fresh mussels served with great toasted dipping bread!  If you like mussels, you will love this dish. \n\nMy girl had never been to North and I forgot to order the Zucs!  A must have at North......\""just order them\"".... You will Love them!  We then ordered the spicy shrimp pasta dish and shared it and it was delicious.  Great homemade pasta, savory shrimp with a slight kick, but not to spicy and great secret flavors.  (Leaks were used to make the sauce).  We also forgot to to order a salad prior to our pasta and were encouraged to try the seasonal veggie salad. Next time for sure. ( we paired our meal with a wonderful bottle of a Red Blend..\""Dreaming Tree\""...moderately priced and very nice....not to big and dry, just nice and only $26 as I recall. \n\nWe ended our great meal with an Epic chocolate tort/moose with a delicious rich nuttela sauce on it.  Overall...great food, good pricing, fantastic service and a fun place.  The only reason not 5 stars was its a bit noisy, but you quickly get acclimated to it!  Thanks Jonas and Kyle....you both did great!  We will be back....."
1,Nice location and lots of toppings.  Pizza was soggy and greasy.  Sucks paying for refills and that they don't do pitchers of drink.
1,"The cheese curds are so good! But don't order the nachos! Worst nachos I've ever had! The cheese is literally super think sauce like the Campbell's canned cheese soup. It's really gross. I just didn't eat them and went to Taco Bell! And I ordered no jalape\u00f1o, it came with jalape\u00f1os. I told my waiter and a d be told the chef, came back and said \""the chef promised there were no jalape\u00f1os! Stay away! Can't believe he essentially called me a liar! Look at my photo...."
4,"Doing Las Vegas Sheets-style is the only way to go.  He took care of everything so that our bachelor party weekend was all fun, all the time.  In the weeks leading up to our trip, Sheets was extremely responsive and communicated with me thoroughly.  He set us with hot nightclubs.  And when we got there, we never had to wait in line, wait for drinks, wait for anything.  Everything was taken care of in advance and exactly as expected.\n\nThis is a true VIP experience.  Let Sheets plan your next Vegas trip, and enjoy yourself."
3,"Dined with a large group on a Saturday evening. We had a variety of steaks all were cooked perfectly and delicious, best in Vegas. The calamari app was the best we've ever had, perfect. My only complaint was the dessert. Two in our group got the ice cream trio, not only was it partially melted very small scoops but there were no \""fresh baked cookies\""  served with it like the menu stated. Disappointing dessert for an otherwise delicious meal."
0,"I really wanted to like the services at this place because it was recommended by a friend and I wanted to support a Sunnyslope establishment. However, after my dog came home limping due to \""knicking\"" her paw pads, and seeing that her nails were not trimmed (nails were curled), I am done giving my hard-earned money to this grooming place. I had no idea that her nails were not getting trimmed until I heard my dog yelping with pain. All I saw was her left leg curled against the side of her body. Find out, she was scratching her body and her long hair got tangled on her nails where it was curled. She ended up pulling out a chunk of her body hair! \n\nI will spare you the rest of the story. I was so distraught that I could not even call them on this because they seem to have an excuse for everything. This is not the first time, they have \""forgotten\"" to do something while conducting a full groom.  Needless to say, please take your dogs to another groomer so your dogs do not have to experience this hardship :("
1,"Meh, indeed.  Decent beer and excellent service. But it's chain food and it didn't do much for me."
0,"Haven't eaten here in years but decided to give it a shot again. Went in, was seated immediately, then the wait began. After being ignored by 5 different servers attending to other tables next to us for over 15 minutes we walked out. They weren't even busy."
3,"Maybe I'm the exception, but I had a good experience here!\n\nMy friend and I decided to come here for brunch one morning and to dine in.  The wait for our crepes did take a little bit of time, but bear in mind - they're making these crepe's from scratch on the spot, and they're really really yummy!\n\nWe split a sweet crepe (banana-peanut butter-nutella ) and a savory one (tomato-pesto-basil).  Both were really really good.  They're also filling!  We were too full to try any of their gelato or specialty drinks, but everything on their menu looked so good that I know I'll be back to try their other items!\n\nThe waitstaff was nice and helpful as well, and inside it was all sunny and happy feeling (yay for lots of windows, bright decor, and white, minimalistic furniture).\n\nYou could call ahead and take out, or if you have some extra time for some good food and a relaxing meal, then try out Crepe Cafe."
1,Flies! So many flies! I won't be back until they get this problem under control.
4,"I went here for a friend's graduation dinner. The seating area was filled. We had reservations and they were right on time. The service and level of professionalism was great. The menu is vegan friendly with a few delicious options. I tried a friend's baked eggplant dish and it was by far the best eggplant course I've ever had. Many people in my party ordered the lasagna and loved it. I ordered the pesto and was disappointed. The homemade noodles were good but the pesto didn't have the pop of basil I was hoping for. Despite the pesto sauce, the experience as a whole was great. I would definitely recommend this establishment."
2,"I have been here a couple times, I would have enjoyed my visit to the champagne bar much more if it was more secluded. I think the cocktails are really good, particularly the house creations. But I would think for a bar that is going for a more exclusive air and charges those prices, they would have chosen a place that gave patrons more privacy. Plus since it's on the casino floor it smells to cigars and smoke. Yucky. The service leaves much to be desired too. It is very slow.\n\nI tried replicating some of the cocktails at home, like the Flower Eclipse, but it really does need that particular champagne. \n\nAll in all, if you are in the Palazzo and have 30 minutes to kill and want a champagne coktail, come here. But don't expect great ambiance or service. You are here for the drink only."
0,"BLECH!  Let me start off by saying that my dad is the king of horrifying cliches.  Strangely enough, they've actually become a vital part of my vocabulary and somewhat useful.\n\n1) If it sounds too good to be true, then it's probably too good to be true\n\n$2.18 per dish for dim-sum?\n\n2) you get what you pay for\nI was telling a buddy of mine that the price trumps the food AND the service.  After being away from the place for a month I forget how yucky the food is and the service is deplorable.\n \n3) fool me once, shame on you.  fool me twice (4 times?) shame on me and i deserve to be ripped off the 3rd and 4th times.\n\nWe were there on Sunday at 11am and my wife remembered that the carts come out from the kitchen and go around counter-clockwise.  Her theory is that by the time they get to the north side tables, all the food will have been picked at and decimated.  \nShe insists that we be seated as far from the main entrance (north side) as possible.  We get a table right up against the back wall closest to the kitchen.  We're sitting there for about 10 mins and no carts even pass by.  \nI'm like thinking, \""ok, dim sum is not really a fast food environment.  You stayed up way too late Saturday night and you stumble in for brunch.  It's supposed to be a slow, no rush, drink tea and have vibrant conversation with those around you.\""\nIt was then that I started doing the math (not because I'm Asian.  I know what you were thinking).  I counted about 40 tables with 30 of them occupied.  I looked around to see what the MO of this place is.\n\nA) there are only 2 carts being pushed around at any time (are they trying to lower overhead costs by owning only 2 carts?)  Instead of having several carts with the same items going different directions, it appeared that the cart pusher would only go back and fill her cart when it was empty.  So instead of just exchanging her empty cart for a \""pre-loaded\"" cart, she actually disappears for about 3-5 minutes (and I presume she's in the kitchen loading her cart?)\n\nB) since we had no food, I had time to count how many employees were on the floor and what their jobs seemed to be.  2 cart pushers, 3 bus boys (their job seemed to be water fillers, table clearers, and check retrievers) Fine, we all know that you can't seat people if there are no clean tables.  Then I counted 3 more (waiters?) with red vests going to tables and doing I don't know what (taking special orders?).  \n\nThere was a man and woman that I assumed were the floor managers or owners that would be walking around doing \""managerial\"" things like looking busy, answering questions, telling others what to do etc.\n\nAll the while I'm thinking \""more cart pushers (the food is kinda important here) and less whatever the other 8 people were assigned to do.\n\nThe 1 hostess/cashier was trying to seat people, take numbers, and take peoples money.  I felt somewhat sympathetic towards her because I overheard a customer say \""you gave us number 22\"" and just seated another party when you called out \""22\"".  She apparently gave two patrons the same number.  She quickly apologized to customer \""22b\"" and out of frustration handed him a slip of paper with the number \""32\"".\n\nNeedless to say, the customer was not at all pleased with the exchange and hotly protested \""uh, I don't think we want to go 10 places to the back of the line!!\""\n\nIt was getting really ugly and awkward but one of the other employees came to the rescue by immediately seating \""22b\"" and things were restored to semi-chaos.\n\nOh, did I mention the food?  When the 1st cart came by our table, the pusher stopped by the table next to us and was fumbling with the little metal dishes and trying to cut the cheng-fun.  She seemed a little shaky and not at all concerned with serving the customers swiftly.  While she was trying to serve the other table, her cart was blocking the aisle and the other cart pusher had to stand there and wait until she was done.\nWhen the cart finally came to our table, we were so famished and anxious that we just started grabbing this and that in fear of never seeing the cart again.\n\nWe grabbed the following dishes:\n1) shrimp cheng-fun:  Rubbery and kinda bland\n2) chicken feet:  Great sauce, but the chicken was not tender and again....rubbery (perhaps leave it in the steamer longer?)  Funny thing is, we've ordered the same 2 dishes the past 3 times and it's the same....RUBBERY!   I guess you could say it's our fault for falling for the same rubber chicken trick each time.\n3) Har-gow:  standard steamed pork dumplings, tasted pretty good (or was I just starving and grateful for anything that touched my chopsticks?) haha\n4) Wu-tao-gock:  Fried taro was decent\n5) Foo-jook-gien:  steamed pork with black fungus wrapped in bean curd skins.  was probably the best thing that touched our palates.\n\nI know what your saying, why do you keep eating the dim-sum if the quality is mediocre at best and the service is non-existent?\n\nPRICE!  it's like a mosquito drawn into a bug zapper."
2,"Not really sure what to say about this place. It has good intentions but it's jumping the gun on thinking downtown people are stupid enough to pay those sorts of prices. The only reason locals hang out downtown is to avoid the strip, and the strip prices. The food is A-Ok. Small portions, big prices. The queso fondue basically went back to a solid pile of cheese in less then 2 minutes. The shrimp tacos were very small. My boyfriend and I both had a margarita and an entree - our bill was around $80 without a tip. Not sure what La Comida thinks they are doing."
4,"It was thanks to the Yelp reviews here that I realized Essence was not just a coffeehouse and bakery, but an interesting restaurant. The decor is pretty non-existent, but the food was something else.\n\nI ordered the Greek platter, and instead of finding myself in front of a huge plate, Essence's version was slighter in size but more provocative in taste. The Spanakopita and grape leaves were excellent, the bread was that perfect mix between crunchy and soft, and I don't think I've ever had better humus. I mean, this humus had complex flavor notes! I ended my meal nicely full.\n\nI chatted with the server and the chef--who apparently studied cooking in France--for a bit; real nice people, and Essence deserves extra points for their philosophy of using environmentally-friendly and local ingredients down to their menus. \n\nI agree with Kristin that it's odd to not only tip up front, but be asked about it too. That aside, kudos all around. I was told they are having a bit of problem building a dinner crowd, so give 'em a try. It's not uber-cheap, but you're paying for quality, guys."
2,"Before heading out to this place, I read some reviews on this place and was definitely curious. Some yelpers hate it, some love it. I happen to like it.\n\nIt tries to hard to be a dive bar but you can' t sell merch and have clean and graffiti free bathrooms and be called a dive. The only divey aspect is it's cash only.\nThat being said, it's fun and yes, it's loud. When the jukebox is playing, their sound system really does suck. Harsh and tinny sound especially near the front door. Head towards the stage and it's less annoying.\n\nThe live music, however, sounds good. Sound guy must know his stuff.\n\nBartenders were cool, bull horning expletives left and right, but it's all part of the show. They jump up on the bar (move your drinks or they'll kick them off) and do some dancing, they ask for the ladies to join, some do, some don't. Service was pretty quick for being a busy place.\n\nThe staff were cool, with the exception of the 'security' guys...dudes, crack a smile, it wouldn't kill ya.\nTons of bra's hanging from the back of the bar. Boob photos galore plastered all over (apparently the photo booth gets a lot of action)\n\nThe area is cool, a block North of Fremont street and there's a few other bars right around here, kind of a block party feel with the outdoor seating and all.\n\nSo if you're into loud music and trashing talking chicks and a quasi-dive feel, check it out. If not, the Mob bar next door is probably a better fit."
2,Mastro's Ocean Club Las Vegas - I think we just had a bad night!  I didn't think it was all that... Good but not oh my gosh good. What really made it bad was our waiter.  When you spend a lot of money at a restaurant you expect great service and our waiter stood around talking and laughing with other waiters and barely paid any attention to us.  Our drinks were empty multiple times for long periods of time.  Took him forever to take our order and acted like he worked at a dinner instead of an upscale restaurant.  I'm sure if we had a different server I would feel better about spending hundreds of dollars on our meal but we got what we got and unfortunately I have to base my experience on that.
2,"Another restaurant to try in front of the epicenter in downtown Charlotte. The Blackfinn salad is a good choice to start off dinner with and maybe some quesadillas. For dinner however I went with shrimp and grits over the blackfinns popular vote the bacon meatloaf. This wasn't served traditional by no means and I wish it where. The dish had plenty of shrimp, the grits where packed together in a triangle shape (weird) but the cheese base was too much. Waaaaaaay too much sauce. Adding sausage was a nice touch for a positive but the dish in general was just ok.\n\nService is friendly, beers are pricey compared to other locations so if I where too choose here again I'd have to try the popular vote the next time."
0,"This was a horrible experience for both me and my friend. \nWe booked our room online based on the photos on their website.\nupon arrival, the hotel seemed okay. I think it's an inconvenience to have hotel parking across the street, especially if one is handicap and needs to transport things on several trips to and from the vehicle. Upon check in, we then learned that we had to pay a $50 a day deposit fee due upfront, this fee is not to be released for 5-8 business days. After paying that fee, there was a \""resort fee\"" to be paid. it was $61.02 I don't understand why the hotel just does not include it with the price of the rooms. (which by the way, none of the extra fees were mentioned when I called to confirm our reservation \""you're all set!\"".  We get to our room, and it smells of smoke. In our blankets, our towels, everything! And we were in the \""non smoking tower\"" I called down to the front desk to explain this to them, and they offered to send in a cleaning person with an air machine. That did absolutely nothing at all. I then called front desk again and the guy who answered asked me what i wanted him to do, then hung up on me.\nThe \""resort's pool\"" is seriously just an over chlorinated waiting pool. And the seating areas around the pool are only to be rented out for a fee. . . Which no one was sitting in.\nThe diner at the hotel has the most horrible service. I went down to get coffee and it took them literally 35 minutes for that. I had to ask for sugar and cream. I guess the server had to go find some. and seemed really bothered. Upon checkout, the hotel charged me again for the resort fee \""by accident\"" My friend had paid the resort fee up front and had a receipt and an electronic bank statement. So I showed this to the person charging me again and he explained that it was charged then refunded. I was like \""what?!\"" getting this person to explain why was a nightmare! He just kept repeating himself. So I asked to speak to the hotel manager. Her attitude was terrible. She told me the same thing. Neither one of the people we spoke to explained that they accidentally charged my card as well as my friends card and that when they caught their mistake they immediately refunded  my card. It's not that hard... Instead they just kept saying it was refunded, It took them 30 minutes to print out the charge and refund receipts. I have never been more happy to leave vegas in my life. I will never stay at this hotel or any other hotel that they own like the Azria. Horrible hotel experience, the worst! and I travel every week."
2,"Perfect airport hotel.  Decent rooms, starting to age but still not bad.  Not easy to get to or find so look for the large gas sign. But if you do, they have a small pool and a large lobby.  Perfect place to hang out if your tired of your small room.  Food is okay but nothing fantastic in my three stays there."
1,"Not such a fan of the chicken, but I do like the waffle fries. I don't like for the breading on my chicken to taste like honey mustard. Also pretty pricey compared to other fast food. The wifi at this location was decent, by wifi standards. Employees were all friendly, but I think next time I'll hit up the In and Out nearby instead."
4,"This place reminds me of the midwest.  Everyone is friendly, the service is good and quick and the food is delicious and calorie-laden, as it should be.  A good place for breakfast.  Generous portions.  The waitress we always get is great."
4,"Korean Fusion at its finest.\n\nItems sampled:\n\n- Smoked Mackerel Pasta\n- House Smoken Yellowtail\n- Beef Tacos\n- Soy Chicken Wing\n- Black Bean Sauce Noodle\n- Omiza Creme Brulee\n\nI'm almost allergic to Italian pasta overpowered by tomato and/or cream sauce, and it's always a relief when pasta is served simply with subtleties like salt, olive oil and not much else. As such, Smoked Mackerel Pasta was a joy.\n\nBeef Tacos came out with tenderloin bulgogi in a thin crispy shell, with three aioli sauce including mustard and lime.\n\nPer the onwer's recommendation, we also ordered Soy Chicken Wing - something we usually don't eat but glad we did - it was lightly breaded and lightly sauced yet it maintained crispy texture. Mmmm!\n\nAnd Black Bean Sauce Noodle with egg white noodle, black bean sauce, pork, onion, carrot, zucchini, green onion and a poached egg. It was our first time ever to try black bean sauce noodle and now we're a big fan! So intricate yet mild flavors.\n\nFinally, Omija Creme Brulee sealed the deal - it was a perfect closing for the 6 course journey.\n\nWe're impressed!"
0,Ate here a couple Sunday nights ago. Several areas of improvement are needed. FIrst off it was freezing cold in the place. The A/C had not been winterized and cold air was blowing in through the ducts. 1000% UNACCEPTABLE.  Secondly the pepperoni pizza was UNREMARKABLE. A frozen pizza from Safeway would have been a big step up. For $10 skip this place and get a Pizza Hut Pizza. The cashier was very friendly.  My advice for the owner is to go sample the top 5 pizza joints in Phx and then SIMPLY COPY ONE OF THEM!  ITS NOT FRIGGIN ROCKET SCIENCE! Two big thumbs down on this pizza joint.
2,"OK, so what am I -- a guy -- writing up Donald Pliner for?  Well, yeah, they do have some men's shoes, but that's not why we were there.  I say \""we\"" because my wife Lynn (aka Imelda) has a thing for Donald Pliner shoes.  While in Hawaii, she picked up an opalescent turtle-like leather show with a metal heel that was -- well, you get (or most of you get) the idea . . . So, being the wonderful, charming, AND faithful husband I am, I told her that Donald Pliner had a store here . . . .\n\nWonderful shoes, but low inventory (\""We're out of that one in your size\"") and several pairs that SHOULD have been comfortable but weren't and -- well, you get the idea.  I think she'll still be buying them at Nordie's."
3,"Very pleased with this World Market.  The prices are good for the wine glasses I've bought there (good selection too!).  The wine is good everyday wine, and priced reasonably.  The help is always friendly and courteous, and the food section---(well, I've been there at least 6 times, and I always seen to find something new in the food section!).\nThe only reason I give it four stars instead of five, is the parking arrangement and it is not easy to get into its' parking lot.... I think the prices here ae better than Pier One....By far!"
4,"Popped into Rick's Restoration on the way out of Vegas. Very glad we did.\n\nYou are immediately received by a warm welcome. The general feeling that pervades the lot is that they truly want their fans visiting and sharing in their fabulous restoration work. Their are numerous cars and as-yet-to-be-restored items lying outside and you're welcome to photograph all of them. You can also see through to the back lot and the fascinating wasteland of awesome items just waiting to be transformed.\n\nInside you are treated to a free tour of the working operations of the shop, where you see items that eagerly await their future owners, along with many lovely bits and bobs from the show (loved the tandem bike and marriage proposal sign!) There is also a well stocked gift shop with many reasonably priced items (a lot of them signed) and even some interesting tidbits to take home and show off (I adore my new license plate purse!)\n\nOverall I loved the open, welcoming feel and the general vibe of this laid back and truly fantastic business. Thanks for not disappointing guys."

2,"We stopped by after a local event for a late luncheon.\n\nWe tried the seasonal brews for Octoberfest (Martzen) and Pumpkin something something brew.  The Marten matched expectations and appropriately was flat by American beer standards.  A solid good example of its type.   \n\nThe pumpkin stout something whatever was good according to my heterosexual life partner.  \n\nWe also tried the fish & chips and beef au jus.  \n\nThe fish was overdone nearing burnt.  Not good but not bad.  The chips were good. \n\nThe beef with sauteed onions au jus was very good.\n\nAlso tried was the Raj India Pale Ale. This brew was more in keeping with the English tradition of IPA rather than American hyper hopped IPAs.  I would describe it as \""okay\"" but not a superlative experience.\n\nOur service from Dominique was very good.  She was warm, friendly, cheerful and efficient.  What items we ordered were delivered quickly.\n\nOverall a pleasant experience."
1,"I'm no sushi expert... well maybe...\n\nWhat I ate:\nSake (salmon) nigiri 2 piece $8:50\nAlaskan Roll $13.00\nCost:  Son Of A B*&$#!!! Expensive for no reason, except its in MGM\nQuality:  I could've bought some damn salmon from a store and made it myself and would be good as what I ate today.  Though, I might not prepare it right get myself food poison, but taste would be the same or better.\n\nAtmosphere is ok, somewhat contemporary.  I don't really care for this place and probably not... wait... I will definitely not go back there.\n\nI'm speechless for the how much i paid for the food that was... sub par.\nI was hoping for i would get really good sushi and some fire works for what i paid for.  AND their fatty tuna (toro) is $38.00 for two peices... overpriced?  overpriced is understatement."
3,Always fantastic service and great food. This is top of the list when we want Mexican.
4,I stopped at the one on Flamingo for the first time yesterday and took forever to decide what I wanted.  I asked the gal at the counter for suggestions and one of hers was the summer salad.  I ordered a small one with chicken and it was absolutely delicious and very large portion.  I will definitely come back.

0,Ordered delivery Pizza was disgusting. Hot wings were disgusting. Price was outrageous in comparison to the quality. Cookie desert burn on the outside undercooked on the inside. Idiot driver placed ice cream over hot cookie so it was liquid by the time it got to us. Shouldn't have even delivered that desert.
2,"5/20/10\n\nIt has been years since I first tried the Roasted Sweet Potato (fig confit, mozz, arugula, tomato, fennel, sweet potato, and balsamic vinaigrette on herb foccacia) here (2003), so I decided to have it again since last having it in Sedona a few years ago.  It wasn't a fave WBC item of mine in '03 (it was all about the Lemon-ricotta pancakes for me then, and still now, although I haven't had any since Sedona, and that's bec. it's rare for me to make my way to WBC on the weekends, when breakfast is served till 2p, and before 10:30a on the weekdays), but I really am a fan of it now!  Even if you aren't a vegetarian, as long as you like your veggies, you would find something you'll like in this sandwich.  (WBC is also willing to customize most items for you- omitting certain veggies and subbing others, if need be.)  This sandwich was very filling, and I could easily have squeezed two meals out of the serving.  I didn't.\n\n5/26/10\n\nWas very hungry, and I couldn't decide if I wanted the Penne or Linguine or the Chopped Salad, so I ordered both!  The pasta came w/ a choice of pasta and a choice of sauce (marinara, pesto, or alfredo), topped w/ parsley and grated parmesan.  All pasta dishes, available from 3pm 'til closing, are served w/ a small piece of grilled garlic bread.  I chose penne and alfredo sauce.  The chopped salad usually comes w/ wild Alaskan salmon, couscous, feta, arugula, red bell peppers, sweet corn, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds, w/ a pesto vinaigrette and a bit of bread.\n\nDidn't care for the penne alfredo at all.  The alfredo sauce was VERY watery, w/ no viscosity to it, whatsoever.  It was very bland- I asked for more parmesan, but it didn't help.  Next time, I'll try the pesto.  The chopped salad, however, was terrific!  I ordered mine w/out the red bell peppers and corn, but it was still very flavorful.  The texture of the wild salmon seemed of the canned variety, but it was nicely presented, and added another dimension to what was already a great salad.  I'd have been happy w/ the feta, couscous, arugula, dried cranberries, and pesto vinaigrette!  Loved the flavor that the sunflower seeds gave to the salad, as well as the crunch factor- so much fun!!  The plain bread that it came with, however, was pretty dull, but that's just me.  Next time, I'll ask if they can sub some grilled bread, instead."
4,"This is our third time to Spotted Donkey and it gets better each time!  The Stuffed Peppers are amazing!  Possibly the best I've ever had.  Not to mention the best Margaritas and Nachos in town!  Love the outdoor patio--especially the fireplace this time of year.  Coming back this week to check out the lunch menu.  So glad this restaurant opened in our neighborhood!  This is a \""must go\"" place."
1,"I had a beautiful wedding and the place was really nice, the people there were friendly and nice, even the minister too. then after the wedding, they shown us all the pictures, we only got 10 pics from the ceremony, and they tried to sell the rest (30pics) for super expensive price, my husband has to pay $269 for extra 15pics.. expensive, it turns out that the pictures cost more than the wedding. cost of the wedding was $240... what makes me upset was, we have to force to give the photographer a tip. minimum is $40, grrr... it suppose to be included at the wedding price.. total I spend about $500 ish.. its like the sugar coated wedding chapel.. I dont know about other places, but if you can go look around, then you should, I dont have enough to look around because we only came to Vegas for 2 days."
0,"Not rude necessarily - but dismissive.  Had something that was guaranteed for delivery by 12/17/12 - didn't arrive on 12/17 - i called on 12/18 - got the word that they would \""locate the package and call me back ASAP\"" - never called back on 12/18 - i called on 12/19, same response, same lack of call back, becoming quite a joke.\n\nLatest update - someone from the mid-west is \""all over this\"" even though my package still isn't here.  We're going on 5 days from the promise date - oh - and it's my kid's first christmas that their package has missed (since we needed it by 12/21 before we left town)\n\nThanks OnTrac!  Another Festivus Miracle for you!"
0,"This place is the wort.  Staff is friendly and maybe someday will get its act together.  They bill themselves as \""world famous\"" but I have no idea what world they are talking about.  Place is noisy,has created noxious odors throughout the Shops at the Village of SouthPark, has kids that run crazy around the fountain with little or no adult supervision. food is plentiful but also about the worst Tex Mex ever,  Do yourself a favor and run for your life from here.  So many other good places in Charlotte.  One other thing - how the h.. did Simon properties let them get away with the totally obnoxious pink exterior that is totally out of place in the Village.  Somebody needs their head examined.  Avoid this place at all costs!!!!!!"
1,"I was on a quest for a good turkey burger, it was my birthday and everyone partied the night before...everyone but myself was hungover so I had to wait until 4pm to get out of the house. my partner recommended this place. Walked right in and got seated right away.  Asked the server about the turkey burgers she said they were really good so I got one with lettuce onion and mustard. It was okay, a bit disappointing but I gave it a shot. Fries were bottomless but not great. Ordered the rusty nail cocktail which tasted like frozen ice with a dash of banana no kahlua and couldn't taste the rum. Not rushing back here anytime soon."
4,"I love this place or I should say I love their ceviche!  If you like ceviche, you MUST try the Hot and Raw Tropical Ceviche; it is amazing!  Also, be conservative when adding in the fresh diced habanero pepper that comes on top....it will sneak up on you as you get to the bottom of the bowl.   If you are not into spice Sol has, I think, four kinds of ceviche and I highly recommend 3 of them (not a fan of the shrimp one).  Another brownie point for Sol is their complimentary, yummy, unique 'chips and salsa'.  Many Mexican places have moved more towards making you pay for the chips and salsa, so I appreciate them keeping with my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant tradition :)\n\nI have had a few of their entrees as well and the food is superbly made and beautifully presented.  They definitely add a little extra 'Sol flare' to all their food, which usually isn't a bad thing, but you should not be expecting 'traditional' Mexican food while dining at Sol.  My servers and bartenders have always been knowledgeable about the food and pleasant- the other reason I keep coming back apart from the ceviche!  In terms of ambiance this is definitely chic for a Mexican Restaurant- no tacky bright decor and neon lights here!  The patio is also very inviting with misters during the hot summers and it is attached to one side of the bar, making it rather lively if it is hopping.  \n\nMy one complaint about Sol is the prices are a bit steep for Mexican food (around $13 for 3 tacos, entrees $15-$30 & house margarita $8+), but I guess they do have to pay rent at the Scottsdale Quarter so I will cut them slack on that.  I should also mention they have a decent happy hour from 3-6 everyday, so if you are on a tighter budget you should go then.  Unfortunately my favorite, the Hot and Raw Ceviche, is not on the Happy Hour menu."
2,Saw a circus show. Was pretty cool. Felt like a kid again.

4,"FAQ\n\nQ: Ew. What's wrong with the Flamingo?\nA: I'm pretty sure they get their distinct color from the shrimp that they eat. If they're not eating fresh shrimp, they're not pink. If you're asking about the Hotel/Casino, then there's nothing wrong with it. Great location, awesome history (Bugsy!), great prices, solid pool, clean, comfortable, vegas, baby, vegas.\n\nQ: Remember that time when everything shocked you? Literally?\nA: Yah! It gets really dry (it's a dry heat) and I would shock myself on every metal object.\n\nQ: A new coat of paint could help this place, no?\nA: I mean, sure, your face could use a new coat of paint too. Simply put, the Flamingo is in a great location, a good place to stay, clean, comfortable, home. Okay, not quite home. But, say, a home away from home!\n\nFYI ... Don't come back from a night of drinking, start playing Caribbean Stud while the sun starts to come up, standing and leaning slightly against the table so you won't tip over, tell the dealer that you'll play her game \""you rogue\"" and throw cards towards her (not AT her, mind you), Flamingo security doesn't take kindly to that sort of behavior.\n\nListen, everyone is grouchy at 6.30am."
3,"This is a fun Thanksgiving Day parade in Uptown Charlotte.  Obviously no floating Snoopys but there are plenty of bands, beauty queens, horses and fun!  It was a much longer parade than I thought - hope for a warm day or you are standing out in the cold for hours.  Many people get there early and line the parade route with camping chairs and blankets.  Very fun!"
1,"I've been here twice now because sometimes you just want a burrito. However, I can do better myself (and in fact, every time I go by this place I think I should quit my job and open a near-campus taco stand). \n\nThe chicken tinga burrito was quite good and pretty close to California style. The burrito portions are small enough to finish and not make you too fat, which is a plus I think.\n\nNachos are likewise quite good. Good for sharing, disappear fast.\n\nHowever, this place serves the worst enchiladas I've had in long time. Decent tortillas and shredded chicken filling, but the sauce is canned and they top them with wilted lettuce and cheese that is dry and crumbly like parmesan in a can. Ick.\n\nAlso, the stools are really uncomfortable, and they serve their sodas in styrofoam cups."
0,"I typically don't write bad reviews about places unless they reAlly did something to upset me. Koi pretended that it was $20 for open bar . We had one man with us and he got kicked out when he tried to order a drink past midnight. \n\nThis place is horrible and they will make a scene about what they offer you outside the  \""club\"". I put the word club in parenthesis because this place calls themselves a club but its far from it."
4,"This is my go to place for a really good beef enchilada. The red sauce is always flavorful, and the combo with rice and beans will surely satisfy your cravings. Even the rice and beans are delicious, and remind me of home. I'm never afraid to just order a good ol' bean & cheese burrito. With their salsa verde, it is the perfect choice if you just want something simple. Of course, they do have carne asada, a typical staple for any Mexican food joint, and theirs is pretty darn good. I always get it as a quesadilla, and I'm always happy with the decision. Don't let their old school tables fool you, this place is full of good food!"
1,This place is always packed. I've never eaten here but I didn't see anything special in their margaritas. It's Vegas so everything is supposed to be ridiculous but paying $18 for a margarita was not cool. I got the souvenir glass but broke it once my friends and I entered clubs. I think it'd be more enjoyable to have dinner here rather than just come for a drink.
0,"I have always loved staying at alexis park until my last stay. They accommodated me with early check in which was greatly appreciated however when I arrived at the room there were ants and termites all over the bathroom. I called to let them know to take care of it because we would be gone for several hours and when I came back there were still bugs everywhere! they then sent a male to spray pesticides in the bathroom and when I told the male that a woman was in there he still tried to go in. He then left in an angry way and the problem was not resolved. I dont understand why they wanted to spray pesticide while people were in the room anyway? They finally moved us to another room and I thought our problem was resolved. However, looking at my credit card statements I have been charged $800 in charges!! The deposit was only $250. DO NOT STAY HERE. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER"
1,"used to be 4-5 stars but now that they are owned by Landry Restaurants-who redid the menu-it just not the same.The vibe and expansive menu has been hacked. Landry Management reevaluated the menu and decided the menu was too diverse and many favorites are gone from the menu.\n\nAlso, the care and cutesie-ness are gone and you can tell they have gone corporate. No more fun here and the changes are not for the better, Our meal was good, but not like before. Previously there was fresher, hot food made with care versus a production line ala detroit.\n\n Sorry, we won't be back because we miss OUR Claim Jumper"
0,"my husband and I really love Indian food and before we moved here from Baltimore we'd order it via delivery pretty frequently. So we decided to give this place a shot. Calling the order in was painful, The person who was taking the order had us repeat numbers frequently and even after spelling Walnut twice, he still did not seem sure that he knew what we were telling him. We should have taken this as a sign.\n\nI ordered palak paneer - my favorite - what arrived was very different - something with peas and it was orange instead of green. When we called in to complain the person who answered the phone did not understand what the problem was and passed the phone to someone else who argued with us telling us we did not order palak paneer but what I found out later to be mata paneer. I've never even heard of this - we did not have a menu and just ordered our favorites.  Instead of trying to make the situation right, by replacing the food or offering to remove the wrong dish from our bill ,they offered the next entree free. \n\nWe continued with dinner and immediately we knew this was the worst Indian carry out we'd ever had. the sauces were really thin and tasted weird. The cheese in my dish had a really off texture compared to the dozen or so places I've ordered this dish from. Since I had never tried mata paneer before maybe it is supposed to taste like a lot of sugar was added. I do, however, know that Tikka Masala is not supposed to taste sour. We had asked for both to be medium spicy but the chef must have put the spice in twice, it was so hot that it was barely edible. The garlic and regular nan, on the other hand, was excellent. The rice that came with it lacked all of the cardamon pods etc in it that I've always had with indian carry out.... it was just plain, really dry, unseasoned rice.\n\nAfter tossing out most of it both of us felt very ill and bloated after the meal, i really thought I was going to vomit. Between the service and the lack of quality of the meal, we will never order from this place again. They can keep their free entree."
0,This place is just awful. Don't get me wrong the food is fine but every time I come here the food takes forever. Even if I order 30 minutes in advance the food is never ready and I have to end up waiting at least 30 minutes every darn time. The employees never know what's going on and more times than not they'll give you attitude. Never returning.
0,"These owners don't care about any of their customers. When you have a complaint, you get the deer in headlights look. They shrank all of my polo shirts and the woman couldn't have cared less. My wife showed up at 3:55pm the other day and the sign said \""open\"" and the door was unlocked. She walked in and they told her they were closed and asked her to leave!! Needless to say we will never be back!"
2,"With Epicentre opening up, Cans is a whole lot different than before. I hadn't been back here since all of the new Charlotte bars opened up, so I was really surprised at how much things had changed.\n\nI used to dread going to Cans, from the mass abundance of meat heads, to not being able to move around in the place. It seemed like they always let way too many people in to actually enjoy yourself once inside. Well that's not the case anymore, as Epicentre has basically cleared this place out. Last Saturday night, & apparently it's become the usual, there was no one there. It almost seemed dead, but maybe that's because I'm comparing it to old times. You could actually move around the place, not worrying about bumping into someone.\n\nEverything else seems to be the same, other than no line to get in & no cover. For some reason the patio up top was closed, so that was disappointing, but the downstairs was open. Not sure if they've always had beer pong & pool tables down there, but it seemed like a good time.\n\nAs for the drinks, it's still the same with only tall boys in cans being served, so don't expect anything crazy in the beer department. I'm not sure about the specials, but the prices didn't seem too outrageous.\n\nSo if you haven't checked out Cans lately since Epicentre opened, & hated it like me, then check it out now because it is totally different. The place seems very mellow now, bordering on a dead crowd. It never impressed me before, but at least now you actually have some space to move around."
4,"Came here on a Sunday night. It was 35 degrees outside in December so only the one floor was open. \n\nWe had eaten dinner at Hakkasan and were also on a guest list for the club. Because of one or the other, we were given one free drink ticket each. Unlike the Bank, Hakkasan honored our drink tickets for redbull/vodka. Score! Only drink out of the question was champagne.\n\nHakkasan is different from other Vegas clubs I have visited in the sense that as I had heard, this club really is all about the famous DJ's. Yes, there are some people mingling in the open bar areas but this is really the place to come to dance or be a spectator. It's really a site to behold."
0,"I had the worst service from one of the workers about not getting onions on my sandwich. I ordered online and specifically said no onions and the sub had them put on. I wouldn't have been so upset about it but when I went in to get my sandwich the worker made a sarcastic remark \""isn't there a button for no onions\"" and this happened twice. I would not recommend this sub shop streets of New York way better and better customer service."
1,"I had takeout from this place today and can't say that I would ever go back.  You can chose which ever type of sauce to put on your pasta, but they barely put any at all...my pasta was very dry and hardly had any flavor.  I would rather have a microwave dinner."
4,"The most unique bar in Tempe, in my opinion. This place is an absolute staple for me personally. If you're looking for something different from the Mill Ave crowds, this neighborhood bar is worth a look. As you can see from the neighboring houses, Casey Moores is actually a historic home modeled to run as a pub. While the indoor area is comfortable and homey, the patio is exceptional (especially for brunch) during nicer times of the year. \n\nThis place has a rich history, almost too much to fit in one review. They have their own wandering cats, a koi fish pond, blarney stone that doubles as a restroom and apparently this place is haunted too. The outdoor bar is perfect and the service is always phenomenal, all the bartenders are some of the best I've encountered in the area. The servers are always friendly and used to large amounts of traffic. I've seldom if ever had a bad experience.\n\nI didn't expect the food to be that good, thinking beer was more their thing, but in recent years it's actually become quite good. Bar food is always top notch, chicken fingers and wings, burgers, etc. I'm partial to their salad with blackened chicken added. Oh, and you can customize your own grilled cheese. One of the best I've had, hands down.\n\nThis place is no longer a secret. Friday and Saturday nights people turn out in droves. If the 'cool' crowd isn't your thing, no worries. Get here early evening pretty much any night of the week and the place is ideal. Love this place!"
2,"Well- it isn't Cabela's. But it is close to my house and isn't filled to capacity with people every time I need to go in and get something. Prices are comparable to Bass Pro and Cabela's- sometimes quite a bit cheaper depending on the item. Staff are generally helpful, and the store is clean, well organized and well stocked."
2,Took the family here for the bullriding! It was very fun! It had a very cool cowboy set up! I've lived in this area for awhile and never been here. Food was alright bartender was on the snotty side. I will come back for the entertainment
3,I love the downtown old school feel here.  Perfect to get away from the glitz and glamour of the strip.  It's laid back. Many free shows by people just trying to make a living... You'll see many peculiar people lol seem to have more luck gambling in downtown rather than  the strip for sure.  What sucks about downtown  is no real free parking.  They make validating a ticket complicated.
4,I got a bike from here about a year ago. I had a flat tire and the guys came to my house to fix my flat tire! The service is outstanding and I would highly recommend buying a bike from here! Great knowledgeable staff!
4,alot of good times will be had here. the staff is chill. the drinks are good. sit down by the fireplace and argue about pop culture with your friends.
2,"I find this quirky little place adorable.\n\nIt's one of those rare vegetarian restaurants that offers meatless meat. You veggies out there know what I'm talking about: the spongy soy-based \""meat\"" that both fascinates and repulses us.\n\nMy husband and preschooler, omnivores both, really enjoyed their meals.\n\nDefinitely one of those spots one must try at least once."
2,"So, I guess this is my local ph\u00f4 place.\n\nI ate here once before, when they had first opened up, and felt it was just average. I decided to try it again as it is slightly closer to me than central Phoenix. What can I say? I had an itch that needed to be scratched.\n\nI ordered the house special ph\u00f4 and a caf\u00e9 sua da. The latter came all fancy, premixed in a tall glass. While I appreciate the effort, I'm really into the traditional little drippy cup you get at most places. It makes the drink more of a ritual, and better tasting too.\n\nOn to the ph\u00f4: I am not exaggerating when I say that this was the most aromatic (in a great way) ph\u00f4 i've ever had! There were definitely some extra spices at play: cardamon maybe, definitely extra anise, and probably extra cloves as well. As far as a big ol' delicious bowl of special ph\u00f4 goes, it was great. lots of tendon, not too heavy on the tripe, flavorful, piping hot broth, rare and well-done beef, meatballs, lots of noodles, fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, jalapeno peppers, lime wedge, etc. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but definitely above average, tasty, and worth the short drive from Deer Valley. \n\nI'd reward them another star if they had more options, like lunch combos or something like that. For the price, there are other Vietnamese places in the Valley that give you more for your money, including flavor.\n\nI'll be back to try the sandwiches soon enough, and maybe the egg rolls as well."
3,Good place to come and get your tire pressure checked!\n\nKeep up the good work guys!  Thank you for keeping us safe on the road!
3,"I came here today for lunch with Tanya L, at her recommendation, and first I have to say - thanks, Tanya! What a lovely place! As you all know, I'm a big fan of the Festival Theatre both as an arts venue and just as a building in general, so I was already pretty sure I'd like the light and space that I could see from outside was a feature of Th'eatery, and I do love a good punny name.\n\nThe food, however, was not a done deal ahead of time. The proof of the pudding (or quiche) is in the eating, as they say, and food at theatres can often be a little hastily compiled and dodgy (yes, I'm looking at you, West Yorkshire Playhouse). Not so at Th'eatery! The soup and quiche options change daily and we're looking at less than four quid for soup and bread, which is darned good.\n\nTanya and I opted for one portion of quiche to share - today's quiche was salmon - and a Classic Board, which includes buffalo mozzarella, ciabatta, a dish of pesto, a big pile o' olives, sliced tomatoes, and various leafy things. Some olive oil was also brought across for us in a cute little old-fashioned oil-can, which I loved.\n\nI adore quiche but often find the pastry a bit of a letdown - again, not so at Th'eatery! The pastry was great; crisp and flavoursome. I wouldn't normally opt for a fish quiche but the salmon was a really nice flavour in with the fresh egg filling, which was soft and came apart easily - though not so easily that it was impossible to divide the slice in half - just right.\n\nThe sharing board was very nice, too. It was tricky to separate the pieces of ham from one another as they were all kind of plopped together on the board but that's a very minor point. The ciabatta was lovely, fluffy and crispy, and with a bit of mozzarella and pesto it made for a few very lovely mouthfuls. I think if we hadn't ordered the quiche as well I might have been still a little hungry at the end but what we had was just right.\n\nThe service was super-jolly, too! Such a nice chap, and he recognised Tanya from having been in before, which is always a good thing. It was quiet in there when we arrived but more people were appearing as we got further through our meal and the service didn't decline in standard at all. What a great addition to an already fabulous theatre."
1,"Ordered delivery at 515 on Monday during Monday Night Football so I figured it would be a while. They said it would be 1 hr, 615 delivery. That's fair- MNF and all. I called at 640 and they said it would be delivered in 5 minutes. At 700 they finally show. 45 minutes late. Not even a call from management to apologize. Really? Next time I'll order from Pizza Hut."
1,"The first time I went to Ishi, the food was great.\n\nEvery time after, it has been just okay. At least twice, the rice was old.\n\nNot good for what they charge.\n\nThankfully I found Toyama."
0,"Extremely long wait times in the drive through, with cement blockers so you can't drive away, smart for them, frustrating for the 10-15 minute wait in line behind people. Then you get your food, Warm at best, poor quality, and for me usually wrong with mayo on it that I asked not to be. \nInside of the restaurant you are called out by number, when they first opened it was a number an a rhyme, 109 your order looks Devine, things like that. That has ceased, and you have mediocre food waiting for you at the counter, that also takes a while to get to you. \nThey're attached to a long johns silvers which to me, gets the same rating, dry, bad food."
3,"I didn't know what to expect.  They have some great little booths with cheap nail polish, hair stuff, home decor.  The employees are so nice.  We did find a Greek restaurant inside.  The Junk Yard Cafe.  They had the best falafel wrap I've ever had.  We would go back just for that."
2,"I like Dutch Brothers. They're A-OK in my book.  They remind me of the small Mom and Pop kiosk operations that you find in the Seattle area.\n\nI've come here a few times now, whenever we're in the area. The employees are supper friendly and clearly enjoy their job of proselytizing the Starbucks faithful. Their only drawback on this road to world domination is that they only sell prepared espresso drinks. \n\nYep, no drip coffee! Also, only a limited selection of breakfast items.  No rolls, donuts, or muffins. Well, they do sell something call muffin tops made by a firm called Seattle Foods. Hmmm.\n\nBoth, the drinks and muffin tops are very good. I only wish they broaden their selection to include drip coffee.  Americanos really aren't my cup of tea."
2,"4 years! That is how long they have been open. As I walked in, the place was empty with two women sitting on the chairs talking. I didn't have to wait and was ushered into the set previously occupied by my threader. After a few quick questions on whether I have ever had this done before she sanitized her hands and my brows. \n\nWhen she got to work, she was all business. Roll, grab a wide section, and pull. I was afraid that I would not have anything left with all the ripping sounds. It took me by surprise because my first experience was near painless. This time, I jumped in shock. It was an amplified cleaning that I did not expect. When I came out, my friend said I looked like I was stuck in a state of perpetual surprise. The good, I have two brows with a distinct shape, a light brush and clip at end was also nice. I was in and out in a matter of 10-15 minutes. \n\nI liked my previous experience a little more since it was more natural. The bottoms were left,  just cleaned up and not sculpted giving me a fuller look. The work done was precise and that should be commended. I will have to be a little more vocal next time. For $10, it is standard to most other threading salons."
4,"We had an absolutely fabulous dinner at SushiSamba. We knew we wanted sushi and per yelp reviews decided to eat here. It far surpassed our wildest expectations. We had the best server, Vanessa, who advised we try their tasting menu. We were not disappointed. SushiSamba is a mix of Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian cuisine and I'm so glad we didn't just get sushi. The tasting menu was exactly what we were looking for and didn't even know it. Thanks to our amazing server we went on a culinary adventure. Vanessa selected all of our drinks as well as each course and she was spot on with her selections. We will definitely be back to SushiSamba and are already looking forward to a repeat performance. Don't be meek ordering here, go for it and get the tasting menu - you will not be disappointed! \n\nAlso, after reading some of the negative reviews I would assume they tried to order straight off the menu... I would not recommend this as what our waitress picked for us wouldn't have entered our minds to order.  I think if we had tried to order off the menus we'd have had a fail meal too. Stick to your waitress/ers recommendations and you will not be disappointed!"
0,"Full Circle is the WORST Car wash I have ever been too! A few months ago I went to the Full Circle by Superstition Mall, they were VERY high pressured to get the MOST expensive $100 PLUS wash, when I said NO and went with the $24.99 wash they did a HORRIBLE job. I got home and realized the back was not vacumed, there were still fingerprints on the windows MANY water spots, to mention a few.  I called and complained, they said to bring it back and they would redo it, I refused to go to that one and brought it to the one on Stapley and Baseline.  They did a great job there making up for the HORRIBLE service at the other location.  So today, I decided to go back to the Stapely location since they did a good job fixing the mistake of the other location. Once again, very HIGH pressured to get the $150, yes $150 wash! Again I declined and got the $24.99 wash. They too did a HORRIBLE job! Windows still are dirty, water spots like crazy, crumbs still on back seat and under floor mats! Just disgraceful! If they cannot do a simple car wash well, why would anyone want to get the better car wash? I won't even call back this time. I wrote to corporate and am demanding a FULL refund! There is no way I will ever go to any Full Circle  again! They are all the same bad customer service, pushy, and all horrible car wash! i have proceeded to tell everyone I know, Kids schools, dance schools and the neighboring businesses to Full Circle.  This place will better serve the community by being Shut down."
3,I'm very suspicious of the reviews that are below 3. I haven't been here with anyone over some twenty years of going that didn't love the pizza. Does it need a facelift? Maybe/ probably. Is the service great? Probably not but it has fantastic food and is very reasonably priced. There is a ton of WT in this area and I wonder how many of ya'll (intentional) were trying to get something free from the jump. This is easily one of the best pizza places in Mesa and to me it's as good as anywhere I've had around the valley. Treat yourself and grab a pizza from here... but unfortunately you can't catch a movie next store at AMC like the good ol days.
3,"This is right by our house and they've always been nice in here so we return because it's always pleasant service. \n\nThere's a Dunkin Donuts and a 24 hour Robertos Taco Shop inside the mini mart area as well. I mostly end up here late at night for snacks and tacos more often than the car wash or lube service admittedly. It's rather busy consistently, but doesn't seem extremely long of a wait compared to some car washes. Lube shop wise, my BF prefers to go to the less busy Terrible Herbst though.\n\nAs for the Robertos, it's fairly consistent food. I've only gotten donuts once as Dunkin is not open very late but it seemed fine to me. \n\nShort and sweet - decent place to get snacks, your car prettied, and to gas up.\n\n(Yelp 100 Challenge 40/100)"
2,We stopped in here for a meal while in Vegas. The theme and decor are fun. A must visit for any Jimmy Buffett fan! My mom and I split the fish and chips meal. Very tasty! It was a good portion and filled us up. The service was just ok.
0,"This Circle K is one of the worst I have been to. I went in last night to get a coffee and a snack. When I walked in there was a young employee sitting on the counter talking to a guy. She quickly got off of the counter when she saw me. She did not bother to say hi either. I got my coffee and snack and proceeded to walk to the checkout. The young girl was behind the counter doing who knows what. There was a lady in front of me waiting to pay as well. After about 2 minutes of waiting for her to acknowledge our presence, she said, \""I will be with you in a minute.\"" She did not seem very busy when we came in because of course she had time to talk to a guy. When she finally was going to cashier she says, \""Oh, this register isn't open. I am on the other side over here.\"" So the lady had to move all of her items to the other counter. Then an older lady came out and went behind the register. I did not realize she was opening her register. I thought she was fooling around like the other girl. I was already frustrated and just waiting to pay. A guy walks up to the old lady's counter and she proceeds to scan his items. I said, \""Oh, thanks for taking me first.\"" She says, \""Well, I waved at you so....\"" I said, \""So I did not see you.\"" I was so angry that I did not even want my items anymore. I left them on the counter and left. Very bad customer service."
4,Amy=the best. Doug=also the best. One of the many reasons why I stay in Phoenix. I've purchased art here and have been regularly impressed with the individuals they choose to show and represent. Utterly delightful.
1,"They've moved to a new location on 2nd street.  We met a out-of-state friend here, half way between PHX & TUS. I figured to give her a good taste of the southwest. Since I don't live in Casa Grande, I thought I'd check user reviews from multiple internet sites.  Wrong!\n\nThe food was just so so.  The wait staff don't have a clue on how the food is prepared.  Apparently the food is prepared differently by different cooks (chefs?).  It's a crap shoot. \n\nI expect guacamole to be made with avocados, not green sour cream with undefinable lumps in it. As for the award winning green chili pork, I can't for the life of me understand what competition they won. \n\nIt's a nice place to eat if you like so-so food and a unknowledgable wait staff."
4,"I'm on a positive yelp review writing kick because I'm in a good mood, so I thought I'd share this experience with Different Pointe of View. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here right before we saw Louis CK perform at the Celebrity Theater. In making the reservation, he had casually mentioned this. \n\nWe show up to the restaurant, and first of all, I was really blown away with where this place is located. It has a beautiful view overlooking Phoenix and it's tucked away in a mountain side or something. \n\nThe hostess was incredibly sweet and greeted us and for some weird reason knew who we were right when we walked in. We were sat right away and everyone who came to our table were charming and polite. \n\nWe started with the butternut squash ravioli, seared scallops, and the lobster bisque. Oh my goodness. I can't even begin to explain, there was such complexity in the flavors, it was very good. \n\nMy boyfriend got the Artichoke pesto chicken and I got the trout. Again, I cannot begin to explain how delicious our meal was. The flavors all melded so well together. My dish came with mushrooms and I completely cleaned my plate. I despise mushrooms! But these were really something else. We skipped dessert, but the table next to us as we were leaving made us regret that decision because it looked incredible. The bill was pretty up there, but, what is to be expected from a place like this? The view, service and food; it all somewhat felt worth it to me.\n\nUpon leaving, the hostess not only remembered who we were but also told us to have a great time at the show. I know it's her job as a hostess to be inviting, but I feel that's something that takes a little more effort to do, and it was greatly appreciated and really made the dinner feel that much better. \n\nThis is a wonderful date night restaurant. My boyfriend and I both agreed if we ever find ourselves in Phoenix again, we will definitely come back to this place."
1,"The one night I ate here with some friends, I shared a Cochinita Pibil and a side of plantains (Pl\u00e1tanos con Crema) with my boyfriend. The slow cooked pork (Cochinita Pibil) was very tender but not very flavorful. For a Diego \""Signature\"" dish, I was a bit disappointed. The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted. They were dry and not very tastey. \n\nThough the food was not very good, the service was great. But I definitely would not eat here again."
2,"Since discovering frozen custard, the BF has been craving it.  Unfortunately, Luv-It is closed on Sundays and Mondays and I've heard there are a few other frozen custard joints around the Vegas area.  A quick search pulled up Sheridan's Frozen Custard in Henderson.  Imagine our surprise and shock seeing this huge building with bright lights advertising Sheridan's.  They don't mess around with frozen custard here!\n\nAs we pulled into the parking lot, we passed by the drive through section and I was still in bewilderment.  Standing in front of this brightly lit dessert place, children and families were enjoying their own cold treat.  With music being played and fans overhead, Sheridan's invites you to take a seat along the bench way while enjoying your frozen custard.  With the glass windows all along the store front, you can easily watch your concoction being put together.  (I always appreciate glass windows because it forces the establishment to always maintain a clean front.)  You can soon tell why this is a chain business.\n\nPerusing their long menu, we were both intrigued by their \""Signature Concretes.\""  They advertise it as \""A concrete is fresh custard blended with your choice of a topping, but it's hard (like concrete).  You cannot drink it through a straw, you have to eat this treat with a spoon.\""  Since Sheridan's only sells Chocolate or Vanilla flavored custards, you kinda have to dress up your custard.\n\nWe both agreed to try the Grant's Grasshopper, \""fresh vanilla custard, green mint flavor and chocolate chips all blended together.\""  I watched as a couple of guys put together our concrete.  It didn't take too long and we both hungrily dug in.  (Check out the picture!)  It reminded me of a McFlurry from McDonald's.  It wasn't quite as 'concrete' as I expected it to.  It was actually more whipped and liquidly, and I think I could have drank it with a spoon.  I would have had to suck hard, but I think I could have.\n\nOverall, it was more ice cream than frozen custard.  I expected a more intense flavor, more egg-like at least.  A bit disappointing for frozen custard.  But not bad for a mix of ice creams and sundae desserts.\n\nSidenote: They are open until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays and until 11pm on the other days."
4,"We went on Friday afternoon around 3:30pm for the Seafood Buffet. We were forewarned about the wait, but we went early enough, the hour wait we expected, was only 20 minutes.\n\nFood was great!  we went on the weekend for the seafood buffet."
4,"So I'm a full fledged sushi lover and will travel many miles for good sushi. This is good sushi. The all you can eat is no joke. The VOLCANO Roll was out of this world. Also the sake bombers are great too. \n\nPlease do not go to Ra this place is ten times better, with better service, less people, and no loud music."
1,Was not impressed. My tuna sandwich was very dry and my salad was not very impressive either. The service was quick and pleasant though.
3,"I can only not give five stars because I don't know what my favorite MLB stadium is yet. Not only because I haven't been to all of them but even among the dozen or so I have been to, I can't rank them like that. The night we went to PNC was pretty perfect though.\n\nThe walk across the bridge is a nice experience unto itself and the view from either end was really kind of exciting. I don't live in Pittsburgh and when I visit my friends there, I rarely get a glimpse of what a good-looking city it is. The bridge totally does that, as does the stadium itself. Having the skyline as a backdrop was really nice.\n\nThe statues and the street concert were also a nice touch but for an otherwise well-designed stadium, it was kind of a pain to get to our section. Maybe we did it wrong, but the zig zag meander with the masses goes on far too long before we can split off into the 100s or 200s or 300s. Lots of other stadiums cut to the chase and send you in the right direction sooner it seems to me. But like I always say, if you want to watch the (insert MLB team name here) play at home, where else you gonna go?\n\nThe food selection was really quite impressive though it was so friggin' hot the night we went we didn't partake. If we had, I know there would have been a Polish Hill dog (with pierogies on it) and a gluten-free hot dog as well. Gluten-free! Way to go, Pittsburgh, you've just out-L.A.'d, L.A."
0,"Oh boy. I don't like giving bad reviews but I have to be real with you.\n\nStrike 1: I had an eye appointment on a Saturday morning and got extremely lost because my GPS was taking me to the ghetto (turns out- my GPS ended up being correct). I tried calling the store 4 times and even left a voicemail. They did not respond back before I found the location or at all. They never called me back despite my panicked voicemail. Does Eyeglass World check their voicemails?\n\nStrike 2: Upon arriving (on time since being \""on time\"" to me means being there 5 mins early) there was such a crowd in the waiting room that by the time it took me to get \""processed\"", I was 20 minutes late for my 9:30am appointment. No problem- it's understandable that it takes awhile to process new patients. However, the front desk clerk was so overwhelmed, it really stressed me out. I was informed that patients are booked every 15 minutes. Whoa- so much for investing in your patient's health! Since it took awhile to process me, my appointment was cut even shorter.\n\nStrike 3: The waiting room is in the SAME location as the first half of your eye exam!!! Really?! When I saw this, I was mortified and wanted to find another provider ASAP. However, I needed contacts really badly. Everyone in the waiting room will see them blow puffs of air into your eyes and all the commentary that comes with that portion of the exam. Is this in any way a violation of HIPPA? Maybe not but I was incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nStrike 4: Lack of follow-up! I needed them to send me a receipt for my FSA account. I called on a Monday and was told that they were going to mail it as soon as possible. Come Friday, I still did not receive my receipt so I had to go to the store to pick it up. I waited 15 minutes before someone even asked me if I needed help.\n\nGeneral vibe: Low quality, poor patient service, will never come back here again. Please destroy my file! I will be finding another provider. Thanks!"
4,"If you want AYCE sushi done right, this is bar-none my favorite AYCE sushi establishment in Las Vegas (Pending if Kan-Pai ever goes back to AYCE).\n\nI know this place has hundreds of reviews, so of course it was going to be busy when my girlfriend and I arrived at 6pm on Valentines Day.  It was only a 15 minute wait which went by pretty fast and we were seated.\n\nWithin 1 minute of seating our server asked us for a drink and an order.  None of that \""wait 5 minutes to get a drink, gives drink then walks away, comes back 3 minutes later to get an order\"".  She was on the ball.  I ordered the Roger Roger! roll and some unagi.\n\n3 minutes later our first 2 rolls were being served.  I just couldn't believe it.  So...Fucking...Fast.  It turns out that this was the theme, whenever a roll was ordered, within 3 minutes at most they would bring back our order.\n\nA+ on the staff for everything.  There had to have been a dozen wait-staff buzzing around such a small area, but they were on the ball.\n\nI did not have a single problem with any of rolls I ate, the Unagi was great and the Roger Roger! Roll will be my go-to choice in my future visits to Yama Sushi. As for desert I had some mango mochi and red bean ice cream.  It's impossible to do red bean wrong.  And I guess we didn't let the mochi thaw out since my gf and I both took a bite into it and it was hard as a rock...whoops!\n\nI wasn't a fan of the miso soup, then again I am not gonna knock them for that since only Naked Fish does miso soup correctly to my knowledge.\n\nDespite it being packed and somewhat crammed, it was definitely an enjoyable experience.\n\nBelieve in the hype...BELIEVE!!!!\n\nPS: I'm a sucker for garlic ponzu sauce, any place that has that in winnar!\n\n#99problemsbutAYCEsushiaintone\n#BelieveTheHype"
0,"Up until about two months ago I was a big fan of Friday's, especially this location. I went there a couple of months ago and waited at the front. And waited. And waited. There were about ten people waiting to be seated, and we had stood there for nearly 15 minutes. One person wiping tables looked up and saw us all standing there, and went back to wiping tables. We left and went to the hotel buffet.\n\nAbout a month later we went back. No problem getting seated this time. The problem was getting waited on. We sat at the table for nearly 15 minutes and no one approached us. Finally, as we were about to walk out the door, the waitress came by and handed us menus. She said she would be \""right back\"" with our drinks. Another 15 minutes passed (the place wasn't terribly busy). By this time I was fuming - and I'm usually pretty calm and tolerant about these things. Finally - 45 minutes after we were seated - we got to place our order. When the food arrived it was overcooked and dry.\n\nAdd bad service to the significant price increases throughout the Friday's chain ($16.95 for a dish with two pieces of chicken? Really?), and my love affair with Friday's is officially over. When I complained to the company they sent me two $8 dining certificates (which together wouldn't pay for a Jack Daniel's chicken platter). If anyone wants them..."
2,Super casual French Bistro on a great street.  Our server was incredible.  In a city with great french bistro's it's hard to give it more stars.  3 1/2 stars if it was possible.
3,Decided to try out this place because I was craving for sweets. I ordered the campfire s'mores booze shake.  It has a hint of vodka which was barely noticeable. The shake was really good in the sense that it wasn't too sweet but yet still very flavorful.  I will be back to try the kobe beef burger next time along with some of their other shakes.\n\nI also love the interior decor and the setup of the restaurant.  It's a fun and entertaining place to just hang out.
1,Smells really odd in there. \n\nBut you sometimes gotta do what you gotta do to get Plum Flavored Ramune.
3,"Excellent service as I really love European style hot  chocolate and the server gave me a sample of it.  It was decent so I ordered a small.  My cup turned out not as steamy hot as the sample and towards the end, there are lumps of chocolate undissolved in it.  I would go back and request extra hot, use all the chocolate and 70% of the milk.  Just make it more concentrated.  They use chocolate powder instead of the traditional constant stirring method."
1,"I'm not really sure what's going on with this place. There are massive TVs everywhere, which seems to be the theme of their bar as the friendly Yelpers before me have mentioned. Somehow this place just doesn't quite cut it though.\n\nI popped in here on a rainy night with two friends simply because we didn't want to walk any further, but it turned out to be the wrong choice of venue. I've got asthma and since the ban on smoking inside that hasn't been such a big deal for me. Unfortunately at this bar, people take it upon themselves to smoke in the open doorway, which meant that I had an asthma attack all the way at the back of the bar because the smoke drifted in that far. Can you say embarrassing? \n\nWe changed seats three times in order to get away from it (and I felt like such a hassle because of it) but ended up leaving after it was clear that there was no getting away from it.\n\nI guess if you like big screen TVs instead of good company, this is the place to go. If you're -like me- asthmatic, do yourself a favour, run don't walk, run far far away!"
0,"First impression of this place was from yelp, Four stars looked like a great place to go to. Mind you, I live about 10 mi away! So, I get there and its ok, doesnt look the part, but hey, never judge a book bu its cover! I make my way to the pedi chair where there was no other patrons.. I sat my purse down and started looking for the remote/ gateway to relaxation.. only to find that the remote was not only worn, but BROKEN. The tech chose a setting for me and it was the worst setting possible. I felt like I was stuck in a machine of bowling balls! I had to stop him before any more damage proceeded. As I continued to sit in misery, seeing there was approx 4 other potentially working chairs, I happen to notice a handful of mysterious activity going on directly before my eyes! Have you ever seen a yellow funnel? You know the ones that butt crack Bob typically grabs from auto-zone when preparing to add oil to his engine? Familiar?  That was the first mysterious object.. What made it even more mysterious was the older gentleman who'd just finished up a pedicure was dumping what looked to be used acetone or something back into the jug for other techs to use! I'm no genius, BUT I do have 20/20 \""no glasses or lasic included\""... IJS.\n\nMoving on to the final straw.I noticed no one took me over to do my full-set. So, I had to remind them which sucks because I let them know when I walked in that that was what I wanted. I felt that Id gotten tossed in to a non experienced tech, Millie was her name.  This lady looked like she didn't know a lick about acrylic and it seriously showed. Usually the tech lets the powder fully moisten with the liquid to make the acrylic. The lady was applying powder under the wet acrylic causing my nails to look like white rocks were under the acrylic. The head lady comes over when shed seen me complaining and starts going off on the girl in Chinese, right n my face. Never apologizing to the one that mattered.. ME!! The solution already?? They decided to drill off half the acrylic so she can reapply in the nasty layers. Lets say my nails look like CRAP. \n\nIts 6 am and I have a long day ahead there is so much more horror to this story and at this rate the reminiscing is lessening the chances of me being a better citizen today. Craney...out!!"
1,"I choose to stay at treasure island because of their good prices and a history of winning in their casino. I didn't have time to gamble this trip so I can't attest if that's true. We arrived around 10:30 to check in and the escalator down to the Lobby from self parking was broken. The elevator was around the corner or you could take stairs. There was no line to check in but the girls working the desk were the most boring, in happy I've ever seen in Vegas. We were informed our reserved king room was not available but we could do two queens and move to the king the next day. We opted to stay in the two queens so we didn't have to repack. After reading the previous reviews of being charged for the room twice I brought cash to pay for the room. The lady asked for the booking card and proceeded to charge the balance due on my card. I stopped her and asked if we could pay cash. She looked at me with attitude sighed and said \""you don't want it on the card?\"" I said no and we finished the transaction she handed us the room keys and didn't tell us about any of the coupons, where room was located or what our room number was. I had to ask her how to get there and she said around the corner.\n\nOur room was non smoking but you could smell the cigarets first thing walking in. The tv sucked, the iron didn't work, moths were flying in from the air vent but everything else was decent. The in room fridge and safe were nice to have. Upon getting ready the first night my shirt got wet from the countertop and there have been some residual clean agent in the counter and it left a bleach stain on my shirt. \n\nThe crowd in the casino consist of older people, cheap tourist and hookers. The tram to the mirage was broken for our entire stay from Thursday through Monday. Not a big variety of food locations especially for later hours although the 24 Starbucks is nice to have so close."
3,Great food and service!!! Teriyaki beef is to die for.
1,"Does this look like a luxury Vegas nightclub or the scarce-used exit of a run-down medical building? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=JvT5VYkd_3HHLnrljGKv7w\n\nI'm not big on clubs in general, but when in Vegas, I like to do my hair, put on a short dress, and go dance until my quads give out.  My first night of this same trip, I had a great time at XS - I'm not just an old lady grumbling about clubs.\n\nI am grumbling that this particular club, due to its status as Vegas's newest, is an unenjoyable clusterfuck, with people packed like rats onto strangely small dance floors.  We tried to maneuver our way onto the floor in the only area playing hip hop, and we couldn't even get our elbows in.  Elsewhere, the music was bad and weird, with lots of irritating house and techno.\n\nThe best parts of the club were the outdoor areas, and Marquee gets that extra star because I liked the pool and the surrounding tables.  Of course, after a certain hour, you need to sign over your firstborn before you get to use a table, but I suppose if you're not too attached to your DNA the space is nice.  The outdoor areas are also fairly breathable, and some of the views are wonderful.  It was a cold night when I went, so I suppose I didn't get to enjoy these things thoroughly.  I also didn't really mind a random balcony we found, where we were able to take off our shoes and observe the dance floor.  But it wasn't glamorous, and it wasn't really part of the designated club experience.  \n\nProbably also not a part of that experience?  Those ridiculous bleacher stairs.  Marquee is huge, like several stories high, and the night we went, the elevators were down.  From what I understand, even when they're operable, it's sometimes better to take the stairs.  To which I respond - what?  Then why does the stairwell look like the kind of shady back-of-the-building place where a girl in high heels might be murdered?  And more relevant to most - why am I expected to take these stairs in five inch heels, so that I almost eat shit by skidding off a step in front of the people in Marquee, who number in the thousands?\n\nAnyway, if you must check out the hottest new club in Vegas blah blah blah, go for it.  If you're a girl, you're still best off if you know someone, and if that someone likes you, you can get in free.  If you're a boy, that same someone will still charge you $45.  We had no hassle getting in, which makes it even more amazing that I didn't have the time of my life.  (I also spent $0 inside, having pre-gamed in the hotel room and at dinner.)  We went early, and if you are inclined to check this place out, do show up as soon as you can.  Get a stamp and go to dinner if you have to - they won't guarantee your reentry, but it worked fine for us.\n\nWhile I won't be surprised if I find myself back here, I can say with confidence that it will not be my choice.  Marquee's infestation of people and parking lot stairs really turned me off, and I will have to be plied with vodka before I'm willing to return.  I suppose in Vegas, though, that can easily be arranged."
1,"This place is such a hit or miss. I try to go here just to support local business but some days I walk in there and get great customer service and some days I don't. It's really upsetting because my dog eats special food. So when some cashier is being snotty with me telling me I need to call days and days ahead to make sure they get the food when I'm explaining I've never come in and it not be here, and her just brush me off is disconcerting. But I'm constantly going in for stuff and having to come back because they don't have it. The staff is sub par to say the least and I feel I know way more about all their brands then they do. I regret to say it but I'll have to go elsewhere even if that means driving far."
4,"I have had beef Pho all over the US and this is one of the best!  Great summer rolls,also.  Place is modern and very clean.  Everyone is friendly and service is quick!"
0,"I am very disappointed with this restaurant. My family came down to visit from California and my family member was looking foward to celebrating his 21st birthday at Phil's. Within the first 30min of being at this place three incidents occured.  To make a long story short each incident consisted of a belligerent individual who collapsed on the floor, screamed and cried.  To put the icing on the cake the people next to us got our food before us and we had ordered are food before they had been seated. Our bill came and it was close to $500. I would have expected alot more from this place for that kind of money. My family and I will never eat at this restaurant again."
4,"Great food, great ambiance, great service.  A winner."
1,"WAIT TIME SUCKS. They take forever, at most, 1/4-1/3 of the restaurant was filled with customers. They took our orders quickly, but we waited about 30-35min. I understand good food take a while..but..I'll tell you more about my 'cooked' food a bit later. There were only two people in our party. \nParmesan truffle fries are delicious. And ronin burger. My burger was a little TOO pink for medium-well. Sadly this was not the first time that happened to me at this same location. And they forgot my husbands tea completely. Service could definitely be much better. Such a shame. The only thing they do have going for them is the deliciousness of their food and ambience."
1,"Meh...stayed here because I got to use my Hilton honors points. The customer service was excellent so they get 2 stars but the hotel is a mess! I thought it was newly renovated?!? The bathrooms were filthy! The ceramic on the bathtub was peeling so it looked dirty and the water pressure was so weak! The faucet was leaky so it was annoyed because of the dripping noise. There was dust everywhere!!!  The person checking me in told me I was upgraded to a strip view...ummmm, yeah it was nice to see the side of MGM. Smh! Nice try! If this was the upgrade I wonder what the standard room looked like?!? The small chair in the room was all stained. The bed were comfy enough. All in all...it looked like an old Vegas hotel. I won't be staying here again!"
1,"If you want your fancy flavored iced coffee, sure go here. But if you want a good version of their namesake- doughnuts, then go elsewhere. Specifically, go south to Fresh Donuts over by Jack in the Box and Fry's to get some of the best doughnuts ever.\n\nThe customer service here is not too great. In the morning, you know, their most busy and would be focused time, they do a poor job. No, \""thank you\""'s, and a lack of attention when we placed our order and pulled up.\n\nSo, if you want decent coffee, dry, chemically enhanced (and chemically tasting) doughnuts and somewhat poor customer service, this place is right up your alley. But if you like quality and local business, head over to Fresh Donuts. Like I said, it's great."
2,"OK this club is cool only if you do bottle service because then you don't have to wait in line and you can actually enjoy yourself because after a while the club gets really packed and you can hardly move let alone dance, but if you have bottle service you have a space were you can move and have fun only thing is we paid $2000 for bottle service that was four bottles and people make sure you finish your bottles cause you don't get to take them with you although you paid for them we still had two full bottles left. Oh yeah and don't waste your time at tao beach it sucks."
1,"I was glad to start working next to an Espresso Royale location when I was only near what I considered inferior cafes before.  My main complaint is that everything is grossly expensive, even for the going cafe rates.  $5 for a cup of (what tastes like sugar-free) mediocre yogurt, dry granola, and one strawberry is a bit excessive.  All of the drinks containing espresso that I've tasted are well done, and I appreciate being able to see them making the drink.  I've tasted a few of the pastries, and they are pretty good, namely the mushroom swiss one."
0,"I walked in looking for a Chi hair straightener and a product I had for no frizz made by \""big sexy\"" and a liquid bronzer.  I just walked around in circles forever while all the employee's ignored me.  There was 20 employee and 5 customers you would think that SOMEONE could've helped me. Nope everyone else was asked if they need help finding anything except me. I only found the hair straightener but not the other items. When I got to the check stand the checker said how are you? I said Not good and she said \""GOOD\""!  Did you know this has a coupon offer in the paper for a two for one do you want to go get another one.\"" I said no I want a manager actually. She got a manager and I was so upset I was shaking & she said is everything ok I told her no and told her what happened.  I said when your checker asked me how am I and I said not good shouldn't she have asked me why instead of saying \""good' like a robot? She said oh yes of coarse. I said is there any reason why no one asked to help me and let me wonder for 20 minutes looking for items? she said no. My frustration was high I started to cry.  She didn't apologize or offer me a tissue I left and will NEVER return.  I wrote a comment and filled out a survey on-line and a manager said she would like to talk to me more about this and she manages this store.  I don't want to talk to anyone about this ever again I am still upset I never found or got to buy the other items I was looking for.  Talk is cheap she should have training classes for her employee's telling them not to ignore customers and if they see them walking around aimlessly they actually might be searching for something and you might want to ask them if they need help. And when a customer says they are not doing good not to say GOOD !!!!!!!!!! Unreal. The employee's are obviously just there for a pay check I saw one on them come on duty to there shift and just stood at the front door gossiping to another employee just standing there. I felt like I was in high school and the teacher hadn't got into the class room yet.  I had make-up on my hair was done I looked like a respectable person I was smiling at first. I am not sure why not one person asked me if I need help finding anything. I am shocked and bothered.  There is a lot of people who need jobs out there and would love to work there and ask customers if they need help finding something."
3,"-yay! they have one here\n-was searching for ice cream\n-didn't feel like having boba/halo-halo from red ribbon or jollibee\n-didn't scope out the store much but it did appear to be the same size as the one in union city\n-still no overpowering fish smell\n-no scoops of ice cream but found mochi balls\n-inline, got the slowest clerk....she needed to retire but she was so sweet\n-\""magandang hapon po...\"" i said (good afternoon)\n-\""ay, pilipina ka pala, akala ko hindi\"" (oh, i didn't think you were filipina)\n=\""MAITIM KASI \""(cuz i'm dark) AS SHE GIGGLES AND TAKES A YEAR TO WRAP UP"

0,"I haven't been here in a long time but now I know why.  It was overpacked and the crowd was awful.  Felt like I was in a bad part of Phoenix or something.  Very trashy.  When I went to go to the bathroom, some guy was smoking a black and mild or something INDOORS by the hallway!!  ugh would not willingly return to this dump."
3,"Stopped in today...only second time in 9 months...for shame!  Beertender was Adam...Fantastic Friendly chap!!  Very detailed and informative about my flight!!  One of the owners showed up during my visit, also a friendly guy!!  Liked what I saw, what I drank and the company today....definitely coming back!!  Thanks Az Wilderness!!"
1,"This was my third visit to get a massage and my last one was quite awhile ago so a lot of things have changed. The first two experiences were great but this one was so disappointing. I ended up in a room in the back which must have been next to the break room. Constantly through my massage I was interrupted by loud talking and laughing. I understand having a fun work place but it didn't allow me to truly relax. The massage felt more like when I go to the  chiropractor than a relaxing and stress relieving massage. While my husband did have the noise issue, he also remarked on how the quality of the massages just wasn't what they used to be."
2,"The food was delicious, but they were closing a few days after and had a very limited amount of items left so it was hard finding something I wanted to order and look on the list and find out they ran out of it. I ended up getting the cinnamon apple French toast and it was really good, but not worth 14.75"
2,"Nothing much different about this location from every other Bed, Bath and Beyond - the layout is the same, the products are roughly the same, even the service is the same. I do like that the staff at BBB is generally a bit nicer than your typical Target or Wal-Mart, though you have to get up to the register for help.\n\nThat can go either way - if you're wandering the aisles, you get to do so alone, but if you are struggling to find something in particular, it can make it a tough road. You could have to trek back to the front to get someone to help you out. Once found, however, they generally do a great job getting you where you need to go - in some cases even ordering the product online and getting it in for you so you can use your coupon, something you can't do if you go to the web site yourself."
3,"Airport is nice, but getting here from Sedona was not fun. Gps took us to some private airport and we missed our flight. Don.\""t trust your GPS"
3,"Small restaurant, clean bathrooms. Kalbi was yummy so was the banchan cucumber, kim chee, tofu and bean sprouts. They also serve hawaiian poke I was worried when I saw the color of the tuna but it turned out pretty good. The only thing that stumped me was the side salad. The salad was really crisp and fresh but no dressing. We never have left over kalbi but this time we did. So it was an order of 4 kalbi dinners, 1 order of hawaiian poke and 4 sodas total was $61 by far the cheapest we have paid for Korean BBQ. Service was fast and friendly."
3,"As far as self-service yogurt shops go, this is probably one of the best.  The yogurt actually comes out of the machines pretty thick and hard, which is a lot more than I can say about most of the competition, and each flavor has a pretty good taste.  The Oatmeal cookie is awesome.  Tastes like the real thing.  There's also a pretty good variety of toppings.\n\nThere are still quite a few negatives.  Tasting cups aren't left out, so you have to ask an employee for samples.  There's only one serving cup size.  Which means you end up with a glop, and deceptively more yogurt than thought you were pouring.  The price per ounce isn't listed anywhere, so you need to ask someone, or just be surprised when you get to the register."
2,"When I get a craving for rice, this is usually the place I head to. I do like the fact that they have a gluten free menu, with my go-to menu items being: chicken lettuce wraps, egg drop soup and the chicken fried rice. My fianc\u00e9 and I have alway have good service here, with the waiters being very personable and accommodating to my fianc\u00e9's interesting sauce concoctions. \nThey also have a good agave nectar margarita. It's just agave nectar, lime juice and tequila. Simple and without all the usual calories in a margarita."
3,"We were at Town Square looking for a new place to eat and stumbled upon this gem. It has a neat atmosphere and so my family decided to check it out. We ordered and then sat outside, and it was a beautiful day. My only complaint is the size of their patio should be larger and the table layout was kind of weird. But, they earn all four stars on the food. My kids shared a grilled cheese (and gave both my wife and I a small bite) it was phenomenal. My wife got the hotdog, which she said was good. I got the I Heart Bacon burger, and I was blown away. The burger it self was delicious and prepared perfectly. I am tempted to say this is the best burger I have ever had, but I have had some pretty good ones in my day so I will hold back on that. But, it was great. The service team there is very good and friendly. We will definitely be back!"
4,Good pupusas and empanadas
4,"If I could only eat one type of food for the rest of my life, it would be pizza. And if I could only go to one pizza place in Phoenix, it would have to be Mamma Mia's.\n\nEverything about their pizza is perfect. Sauce. Cheese. Size. Crust. Price. All perfect.\n\nAnd I'm not a huge wing person because I don't like fried food, but I am pretty sure Mamma Mia's wings are baked and they are delicious.\n\nAnd the customer service is amazing. Last time I was in there, they threw in a free 2-liter bottle of soda for free.\n\nPizzeria Bianco, you ain't got shit on my Mamma Mia's."
2,3 stars for the hot and spicy mcchicken and free wifi.\n\n-Service sucked.\n-Dining area was filthy.\n-The guy moping the floor didnt know how to ring out a mop right.\n\nThey have a number on receipts for customers so they know which order they are. The guy calling out customer's orders wasnt even calling out numbers he was saying the items on a customers order. The people waiting right next to me were confused because some of them also ordered the same thing I did. Most of the staff looked like they didnt really give a damn about their job. I wouldnt give a damn neither if I was working at a McDonalds at 3am in the morning.
2,"Good food. Good staff. Good ambience. Prices are a little high but not too bad. Have had brisket with corn cakes (good), tomato bisque soup (very good), Irish road Reuben (very good), fish & chips (good).\n\nNot a beer drinker but all that I've tasted here was very good, and they have an impressive selection.\n\nI've eaten at the GD by the Capitol, Hilldale GD, and the one out east by Grandview Commons. Consistent quality.\n\n\n\nEdit \nHave since been back: horrible service. Slow, unresponsive, callous. Won't be back."
3,"Their best roll is the oishii.  It's probably my favorite roll in the Pittsburgh area.  The place is reasonably priced and the food overall is of a high quality.  It's a VERY casual place, however and it's located near the University of Pittsburgh in Oakland.  Parking can be a little tough, but there is a small metered parking lot near by."
0,"Let me say first that I have and currently work in the restaurant industry, both as front and back of house.\n\nThe food was very good, as I would expect from a fox concept. We shared the pretzel fondue and the pork belly Cuban. The both were great and came very quickly (I am a sucker for all things pork belly) \n\nThe food alone made it a 4 star( a bit pricey but it IS Scottsdale fashion) however the atrocious service made for a 2 star review.\n\nOur server started off ok, greeted us and got our drink orders (a couple of iced teas) then brought the drinks and took our food order. Had I known that getting a refill wouldn't happen I would have paced myself to really savor it.\n\nWhen our food was ready out server simply handed it over the community bench ( and over my girlfriends head and shoulder) rather than walking it around table side. This seemed downright lazy, and a bit risky and one of the items was steaming fondue for the pretzels.\n\nWe didn't see the server again for the duration of the meal, no check in on the food, and my glass sat completely the whole meal. Now I am not afraid to ask for what I need, nor do I need/expect constant attention; however our server was MIA and all the other staff was hanging out by the expo/hostess stand and I wasn't about to go chasing someone down.\n\nFinally when the server reappeared it was to drop the check, then he was kind enough to ask about the refill as he took my card and brought to go boxes.  The last straw was when rather than offering help packing up the to go he dropped the boxes and ran. This left my girlfriend to handle the cast iron mini-pot of fondue ( which held over a tea light was very hot) luckily years of hot pans in kitchens have left my fingers able to handle hot things. I don't see how most people would not burn themselves, seemed like an unsafe practice to me.\n\nLeft a 10% tip which is as close as I get to stiffing a server. Having worked in their shoes and seeing servers on the other side of the pass really working their but I generally aim for 20%-25% grat.\n\nMost likely will not return, and will be a little wary of any Sam Fox place I haven't been before.\n\nRecommend any of the other fine Scottsdale eateries in the area just not this Fox concept."
0,"WORST STEAKHOUSE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. \n\nSo I just stopped by to have lunch by myself. I read the reviews and cannot wait to have a perfectly cooked Filet Mignon. I got the BBQ shrimp and the Filet Mignon ordered specifically MEDIUM RARE. The BBQ shrimps are four tiny shrimps that are by no means jumbo shrimps but suspiciously resembled frozen out of a bag. \n\nAnd then is the Filet Mignon. They overcooked it so much that when I taste it, I almost wanted to cry. It can hardly pass for well done. I was so hungry and I waited 35 minutes for it. But I had to wash it down my throat with water. If this is MEDIUM RARE, then I will be ordering a live cow next time. The manager Michael did come by, confirmed that the steak is overcooked and asked if they can take it back. (I cannot wait for another 30 minutes for a new one. Doesn't a customer's time mean anything to you?) This is nice. But when the chef finished cooking my steak, how can he decide this is OK to serve? He must have cared so little about how his customer would think to decide to serve me this. LET ME TELL YOU. IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN SPITTING IN MY FACE.\n\nPaid 95 dollars for the bill. I am feeling like a complete loser right now. Good thing is at least I came alone. If I have brought my GF, she would think I want a break up. And Michael, next time this happens, just take 20 dollars off the bill. You guys can never be a top notch restaurant."
3,"The Brie turkey spinach fig compote omelet was a nice change of pace. Cool spot. Good, varied menu."
2,"I've only been in the casino section of the Plaza, so I can't speak on the hotel rooms.  The casino itself is alright - nothing special like most casinos.  It has a few restaurants (try Pop Up Pizza - it's the best!) and the other normal casino stuff.  It's one of the smokiest on Fremont, so I don't go in there unless I have to."

The decor is a fusion of (someones perception of a) classic country estate and a modern functional bar, a little odd but actually cool once you settle in and fitting given the age and design of the building.\n\nWithout the quirky decor perhaps I would be less keen (though the alcohol selection is good, so maybe not) but as it stands I like the place. As to the food, well I am a meat eater and my carnivorous instincts were well served in the Golf Tavern, if however you are vegetarian your options are somewhat limited...\n\nAll in all though a comfortable pub to quaff a few brews in."
1,"Appetizers were great. Lobster taco exceptional.\nRib eye steak, one of the worst ever. Under cooked and full of gristle.\nNo response from complaint to server. \nLamb chop mediocre at best. \nPork tenderloin good.\n2 beers one mixed drink no dessert, bill 180 per couple.\nReally?\nWould never go back."
4,Taaaaaaaaacs!!! Bomb digitty all day errr day. Uwwwwwee!
0,"This is NOT a Church affiliated to the Roman Catholic Church.  It is a Schismatic Community.  If you are not familiar with this church or are new in town AND you are Roman Catholic, attending services at this location will NOT fulfill your duty of attending mass."
0,"Descriptive phrase: worthless.\n\nNo. Just, no. I lived in Madison for 4 years and never came to this place nor ever heard of a single person who had. Now I know why.\n\nLocation: hidden off the main drag. Bouncer: really, for this place? Bartender: nice. Drinks: not as cheap as other places and much weaker. Patrons: townies and/or creepy as all get-out.\n\nThe decor was the only saving grace of this dive. They really went all out on trying to decorate the inside with tiki-themed posters and idols and the like. But it just couldn't overcome the other issues.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the entire place reeked. Like, seriously smelled like a toilet. \n\nWe couldn't believe how bad it was. We literally made a promise never to return."
2,Really good food. Had a couple Papusas and some of the sausages. I completely enjoyed the meal. To bad that the atmosphere was ruined by one of the clients that was drunk patron who was looking for a fight. The staff kept serving the guy and allowing him to talk down to patrons. The abuse didn't stop until he began to abuse the staff.
1,"Hate to say this, but I really wanted to like this place. Everything started out great, we were impressed with the beer selection and we ended up getting a great beer flight. That was all that was good about this place. \n\nAfter ordering drinks, our waiter disappeared. We finally had to ask another waiter to send him over so we could order food. If only we had known, we would have stopped after ordering beer...\n\nWe started with the \""Devils on Horseback\"" (bacon-wrapped dates) and they were shameful and bland. You want a real bacon-wrapped date? Head over to La Cave inside Wynn next door. \n\nI had high hopes for the mussels since they came highly recommended from the staff, however those hopes were dashed. They came in a giant pot (not good for sharing, even though our waiter said they were...) and were also tasteless.\n\nWe stopped ordering after that since the food was so disappointing. We ended up having Dinner Part 2 later on that evening since we were still hungry after leaving Public House.\n\nSkip it, there are a thousand better places within a stone's throw of this place."
2,"For the food I ate I have to disagree with the previous reviewer about Santa Rosa Taco Shop being better than Roberto's.  I ordered a large salsa, a beef tostada, and a tamale.  The salsa was rather bland.  I would not pay $3 for a large again.  If I am inclined to make salsa I think mine is better.  The beef tostada was good and inexpensive but if there was a Roberto's around I would rather go there.  The beef used in the tostada is better at Roberto's.  Finally, the tamale was fine but the favor of the filling was lost.  Maybe due to the red sauce.  My meal was $8 and though not outrageous I think I would have a better and cheaper meal from Roberto's."
2,"Surprisingly a nice fabric store, bad service.\n\nFabric selection - was not bad. Easy to get to since it's here in Charlotte, and not a far drive to like Gastonia. Liked how you can easily get fabrics that are typically on sale during the holidays. \n\nGood find - they had few selection of furniture, wall art, holiday decor, sewing machines, things for the people who likes to sew by hand, pretty much everything. It was convenient to go to.\n\nService - this is where it grates me. One lady is nice and she was helpful. The other older one was just in attentive. When it was my turn to get my fabric cut, I asked her a question, only to be ignored. She was too busy listening to another conversation. So when there was a pause/moment of silence, I asked her my question again. She then continued to talk to one of her fellow worker and another customer. I don't understand. If you had business with the customer, which you clearly asked me what she could help me with, then... Quit being nosey! She did not even remember the remnant cloth code. I know you worked there for a long while now. \n\nI have been here 4 times already.. And I just stick to the younger lady. Much more helpful. But I'm sorry I had to give this place 3 stars."
1,"I really really really liked this place until our most recent trip.\n18% automatic gratuity on room service PLUS a $5 delivery charge.\nRoom service took and hour and a half when they told us 45 minutes.\nFudge cake had a black curly hair on it we didn't see until the next morning. We're all blondes.\nThey automatically charge a $50 \""convenience fee\"" if you overstay your 11 am checkout.\n\nLittle things like that are so annoying it will make me go somewhere else next time. There's too many Vegas options to give mediocre service."
0,I ordered a table that ended up being too big for the area. Before I paid for it the salesman assured me it's all 100% refundable for any reason within 14 days and to just go ahead and get it since I have nothing to lose. The table was too big and I requested a refund within a day of getting the product. They refunded all except for $200. The charge was for delivery.... Don't waste your time here the sales people say what they need to in order to make a sale. Company management seems to be a joke. Go somewhere else!
1,"Went to this restaurant frequently since it opened. Recently noticed a change in the food quality and service. After allowing for fluctuations, today I again experienced the quality drop. I used to forego going to OrchidGarden for dim sum because  East Ocean is closer to me and the dim sum is almost comparable. The quality of the dim sum now has deteriorated so much that I must drive the extra distance to Orchid Garden. The service has deteriorated also. Now there are a few \""supervisor\"" type walking around (doing what ?). The service still is unattentive and has deteriorated to the old cliche of poor Chinese restaurant service. Then the price has also gone up. So, overall East Ocean is no longer the substitute for the better Chinese restaurants along Spring Mtn. Sad  to see this happen because there are a lot of people in the Henderson area that appreciate good, if not excellent Chinese food."
4,"This place is fantastic. I only go to Mac's for lunch, but I have never ordered a bad item on the menu. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys southern pork barbecue."
2,Not so much a tip as observation ...    Huge practice with multiple docs so can be very crowded even with large waiting room.\n\nRoutine visit for old injury.  Not near as crowded today.  I have to say they typically move very fast even with a crowded and LARGE waiting room.  12+ doctors and twice the staff.
1,"Luxor, you disappoint me.  This is a an aging property on the south end of the strip and while I've stayed there three times, the prior time being the most pleasant, it is really in a tired state.\n\nWe had an incredibly poor experience with the Shelly, the gal at the check in desk, the YS detailed it in his review so I won't bring it up again and that's how it started.,with incredibly poor customer service.\n\nIt used to be, too, that they had security near the hallways watching who went up and down in the elevators in the towers, that is no more and also you are no longer required to use a room key to operate the elevator so that means any and all can use it at all hours.  A fact I was not pleased to hear.  Shelly didn't tell us about that someone else a day or so later told us when we couldn't make the key work in the elevator.\n\nI dislike greatly the timeshare people that they allow on their property that hound you every time you walk by, however, we must have gotten better at dodging them or they are slipping because it was minimal hounding.  \n\nAll in all, I'll try a newer property elsewhere on the strip.  I've recently stayed at the Encore and that was a much nicer experience.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan interests me as well.  It's definitely in the newer nicer property list.\n\nI usually say I'll be back but don't bet on it."
1,"The new process is awful. Instead of picking out your own ingredients, you are served Subway-style, which makes it less customized and MUCH less efficient. \n\nWhen I walked in, there was a line out the door. Once I sat down, there were no sticks to identify my bowl, and the server took quite a while to arrive, so I ended up behind a group of 12. Then the new process of communicating your ingredients to staff took much longer. Additionally, they appeared understaffed (for a Friday lunch hour? That seems like a predictable rush time), so everything took longer. (This visit was well over an hour, which seems like a long time for fastish food.) Don't plan on this place for a quick lunch stop.\n\nMost staff were friendly, with the exception of the brusque rice-serving woman who seemed annoyed at her job. (Did you want me to have food allergies? Why so upset??)\n\nI used to really enjoy FTG, much more than others like it (Hu Hot, etc.). However, I don't think I'll be recommending or returning anytime soon, especially with better, local options so nearby."
1,Looking for a decent cocktail then this is an ok place.  Looking to see people?  Go elsewhere.  Lot of people but mean age easily 50+.  The styling and music were cool with V for Vendetta or skimpy red dress or bound and blindfolded women go-go dancers.  This had the potential to be a very cool place.  Seemed the pretty people hang out elsewhere.
0,"This was the worst experience I have ever had in a Starbucks. Very unfriendly staff.  First Starbucks I felt that everyone had an attitude.  The cashier took my order and didn't even smile or thanked me after I ordered. I paid with my rechargeable Starbucks card and asked to see if I had any load in there. She just threw my other card that had zero balance without even asking if I wanted to reload it. Handed me my receipt and walked away without telling me that she got my order or thank you. To top it off, I ordered a donut and didn't give it to me until I asked for it 10mins later. The crew memeber didn't even apologize for forgetting to give me my order as if that's ok to just go ahead and give it to me without any explanation or at least apologize for the mistake or delay.  They need to change the crew inside that Starbucks. I would now have 2nd thoughts going in that particular Starbucks."
0,"Worst Starbucks I've even been to. I avoid this place whenever I can. Terrible service, slow drinks and filthy inside! I have complained to the manager, emailed the corp office but seems everyone is fine with this because it never changes. I could tolerate the slowness and even avoid the questionable interior....but I can't excuse rude employees that seem to think they are superior to everyone around them."
4,"We have no shortage of Mexican Food joints in the Phoenix area. Some would say we maybe have too many. However, as an avid Mexican Food fan, I can't ever have enough. I will say, though, that some tend to be the same old story, with slight tweaks. Example? The burrito at Garcia's tastes a lot like the one at Manuel's. Don't even get me started on Macayo's...\n\nHowever, Fuego Bistro is that breath of fresh air that we Mexican Food lovers have been waiting for. Everything is fresh, unique, and absolutely fantastic. The first time I came here, I tried the pernil asada, a tender, shredded pork dish that beats any carnitas-style dish I've ever had. The crisp, sweet red cabbage that they serve with it and other dishes is so amazing that even I eat it, and I typically hate cabbage. \n\nThen there's the happy hour. Cheap prices on wonderful food, to include the Cubano Sliders. Oh my goodness, were these something to die for. They go quite well with a cold Modelo with lime too, by the way.\n\nPrices run a bit high, but the lunch menu offers a bit of a break, and happy hour of course is very reasonable. In all, you won't be disappointed here. If anything, you'll be thankful for a fresh take on a cuisine that has become rather saturated into the Phoenix area. My kudos to the chef, staff, and owner of this fine dining establishment."
4,Fav hotel in vegas!!!!  Every time i go there I feel like i'm being treated like a king.  \nThanks Palms Peeps!
0,"My roommate called Windy City tonight to place a delivery order from his cell & Tina answered, she was extremely rude and nasty saying \""We don't deliver to you, your out of our 5 miles zone\"" Which is a complete crock because on April 8th at 8:19pm I placed an order for delivery with Nena V check number 126, Approval code for my debit card is 041923. Yes I have the receipt which everyone can on Windy City's Facebook Page. My roommate then called back and asked to speak with the manager because her attitude was so bad and the fact she lied to him about the delivery, he wanted to let someone know. Well when he called back and asked for the manager she proceeds to say \""Oh Jeff, well the manager is cooking he will call you back\"" He is from Chicago, He Loves the food here and even got me admit Chicago does better pizza and I'm from New York. but after this experience we both will NEVER go there again. We rather drive to the other side of town and go their location on Lake Mead. Also watch out for out for this locations apparent bad business practices because I just noticed on my bank statement they charged me $38.13. I did NOT give a $10 dollar tip!!!!!!   If you notice on the receipt I was already charged $3.00 for a tip!!!!"
3,"The best italian chain restaurant. Service as always was spot on. The food was excellent as always, and served in a timely manor. I normally order the chicken Parmesan with a side of fettuccini  Alfredo but this time opted for shrimp and scallops in a butter sauce. Both were cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing. The minestrone soup was delicious as always and the fried calamari was out of this world. Their entire menu is a home run."
0,"I was in the store for 20 minutes and no one acknowledged I was there.  No \""hello\"" when I came in, and no one asked if I needed help.  I was the only customer in the store and there were 4 employees!  The only thing any of them said to me was the total cost for my stuff and then \""sign here.\""  Two of the employees were watching the game on TV and the other two were having a personal conversation while they were ringing up my stuff.  I was treated as if my shopping in the store was an inconvenience to them!  Stay away!  I'll stick to the play it again Greenway instead!"
3,"I do not know what everyone is Safeway giving a hard time about.  I recently moved here from New York City, so perhaps that is why I feel that Safeway is great.\n\nThe store is very clean and has very fresh fruit and veggies.  Additionally, the weekly circular (which gets delivered to my house) tends to have quite good deals (including $1.99 boneless chicken breast, sometimes, which I definitely hit up!!).  \n\nI have never had a problem with finding what I need and the butcher shop is great.  On the East Coast, it seems impossible to find steaks that are nice and thick- good for grilling."
4,"Don't worry about the \""YELPER OF THE WEEK\"" (photo)... Great spot! Want something you can't get at every other place in Phoenix? Come Here."
4,Bob is great.  His wife Beth answers when you make appointments and she is very nice and helpful. They have installed outside lighting and run coax for me and did a terrific job.  They have reasonable rates and are very personable and professional. I highly recommend them if you need electrical work for your home.
4,"Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water!! Such a tease! I wish we had one here in the Bay. The menu is HUGE and I mean that figuratively and literally. You can fan yourself with the menu, block out the entire neighboring table, build a fort, omg it's freakin' huge. I almost poked my friends eye out a few times oh and almost knocked everything off of the table. Everything here is HUGE. The water glass alone requires you to double hand it. If you are a soda lover like me and drink it so fast that you hate waiting for a refill...well you won't have that problem here because your soda glass is about a liter :) yippee!! \n\nI ordered the antipasti salad and it had so much yummy meat in it! It was a darn tasty salad and the dressing wasn't overpowering. I think it probably had more meat than lettuce...not complaining! One friend had the hot wings, yup, they have a diverse menu. The other friend had the ravioli. It was one giant ravioli! I had a few bites of it and it was good but it can definitely be a bit too much ravioli. \n\nThe table next to us had a little tike and they gave him a roll of fresh dough and a pizza pan so that he could play with it. Kinda cool...wonder why we didn't get that option ;-) \n\nAgain, wish this place was in the Bay Area. I love that they had misters in their patio/waiting area. It's obviously not there for looks. Did I mention Phoenix is HOT?! Heart this place!"
4,"I'm a chocoholic so I'm always in heaven when I come here!  The turtles are to die for!! The almond bar is awesome and, of course, their chocolate covered strawberries are truly remarkable!! Whenever I go to Fashion Square Mall, I always stop and get my $4.00 turtle!"
1,"I had 2 and a half hours to kill so I'm glad that the airport had a bar with draft beer.  The food didn't look too great-- the person next to me was eating tacos but it had a weird smell to it.. like old meat.  I'm glad I wasn't hungry.. haha.  \n\nI sat at the bar, which was pretty full and ordered a few Draft Stella's.  The beer was good and the bartender was nice.  He informed me that we are allowed to walk around with our beers in the airport terminal which was awesome.  I had the bartender put my last beer in a plastic cup so I could walk around.  Each beer was about $9, kinda pricey but it's an airport so I wasn't trippin."
3,"First time my fiance and I were there (happy hour) there weren't that many people in the restaurant and the food was soooo good (we got crispy basil chicken, pad thai, green curry, and drunken noodles) this place immediately became our best thai restaurant to go to. \n\n2 days ago went to the restaurant again with work people telling them it is the best thai place around here, we were very disappointed with the food. It was a busy dinner time with lots of people so maybe that's why the food wasn't that great? \nThe table attendants were super proactive, but food was bland and not yummy :'(\n(Plus I like my pad kee Mao with flat rice noodles not with pad thai noodles)\n\nTo summarize, first visit, 5 stars, second visit, 3 stars."
4,"I have been there several times and every time I have a great experience. We have ordered different things bisquit and gravy, omelets, pancakes, all the regular breakfast foods and everything have tasted great. You cannot leave this place without trying the banana nut muffin, breakfast potatoes and the coffee. All the dishes we have tried for breakfast have been delicious. This place is a must and is on our list for every Vegas trip. We have even purchased their coffee bag to make their coffee back at home."
2,Boston's is closed down.
3,"Party of three, arrived at 4:30 pm. You seat yourself. Impressed with how busy it was so early in the evening. Service was great. I ordered the shrimp tacos. I liked the refried beans, you could taste the ham bone flavor. I will definitely be back."
0,Beware. Tried to place us and three other couples in a car with no tire tred.
2,"Solid spot at 4 a.m. Got a baked Mac and cheese - it was way too salty, but I was starving. I also got a juice (can't remember what kind) and was very disappointed. It was like $6 for the size of a Starbucks water cup and it wasn't even freshly made! She poured it out of a plastic bottle! \n\nGo to Zoozacrackers around the corner instead if you're looking for a quick bite."
4,"Always the way to begin your trip to Vegas.  190 octane or a hurricane...both are delicious, but I haven't tried them together...that will be my next mission.  Always get the extra shot...so worth it.  Jello shots are fun, too.  If it is kind of slow, they will make you take it with no hands and whipped cream.  So, yay for fun bartenders.  \n\nSummer is on it's way, kids...so enjoy yourself some blended goodness."
0,"Wow. Terrible service last night.  We were seated at our table for 40 minutes without a single glass of water. We had finally gotten our drinks 30 minutes in. The two plates of bread they brought out for the table of 15 were long gone and we hadn't ordered any food yet so we asked for the manager.  His rude and defensive response has to be one of the worst I've ever witnessed.  My brother was so annoyed he asked the guy to walk away.  When the food arrived it was sub par.  It certainly wasn't as good as it used to be.  The Mac n cheese was dry and flavorless, our meatballs were bland, we got about half as many padron peppers as we used to.  My shrimp ceviche was served on a different plate then it used to be leaving my tortilla chips to sit in the juice and become soggy.  Thank goodness we had the best company and we were able to laugh and still enjoy the night.  I will not be back...ever"
2,"Went here a second time recently! The matzo ball soup was much better than I remembered. The ball itself had a nice garlicky kick. The latkes were good as well. However, the bagel was mediocre, and I couldn't get any challah bread, which I needed for Shabbos. Anyhoo, good to see they're surviving way out here."
4,"Went here to get my mother's car smog checked. It's just around the corner from our house, so that right there was a huge advantage to going here. I drove right up, got everything done in less than 10 minutes, was able to pay by credit card, AND got a CD out of it; for those scoring at home, it was a Los Tigres del Norte CD (East LV por vida!). Easily the most stress free transaction I've ever had involving a car.\n\nIf you're ever in need of a smog check and you're on the far east side of town, hit up Nate's."
0,"I bought my daughter a ticket to ride the bus July 21 at 12:30am from Las Vegas NV.On this day the bus had some mechanical problems so the trip was going to be delayed. At around 1am the Mega Bus employee made an announcement that the bus was not leaving till 3:am so he took the boarding pass from my daughters hand who is disabled and said sorry folks! I asked him what do you suggest he said come back at 3am or call customer service. So we came back at 3am and nobody was at the stop. So I called in the morning and dispatch informed me that the bus left I want to say around 1:20 not exactly sure. So I called customer service and they stated they would re-issue me a ticket for a $5.00 fee I said this was MEGA BUS fault she missed the bus! Then they said sorry lets get you over to CS at that point I wanted a refund and explained the situation that my daughters grandmother passed away and she missed the funeral. Well the lady said in this case we can give you a refund. Well today I decided not to get a refund and get another ticket and the customer service Rep didn't care what the situation she implied this was my fault and I need to send the obituary even if I just want a new ticket! I told her, but this is not the reason we missed the bus your employee turned her away at boarding! She refused the help me I told her I would file BBB complaint and she said it was nice talking to you bye! I feel mega bus pretty much stole money from me and they are refusing to return it! I didn't realize this was how they did business. FYI- Yesterday evening I went to the bus stop and spoke with the mega bus employee and he remembered clearly and said yea I'm sorry that day was a nightmare. I filed a BBB complaint over a month ago and they are still investigating this.-HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!   I'm going to travel with [BOLT BUS] from now on they offer the same deals $1. & up!!. The stop is at the LINK check it out boltbus.com"
3,"For your typical fried-food fare this place is pretty good. My kids constantly ask for either the hot dogs or cheese on a stick every time we are near the mall. The plus side is that it's not as messy as some of the other options, but the downside is that everything is deep-fried.\n\nWhile you won't find gourmet food here, you will find traditional circus food. Corn dogs, cheese on a stick, fries, and several different flavors of lemonade. Compared to some other places, Hot Dog on a Stick is as good as it gets."
1,"Mediocre food.  Absurd wait times.  Cilantro in every pore of the meal.  REALLY REALLY LOUD.\nCabo, I'm just not that into you."
0,"A total nightmare of an experience with this lot. I fly into Phoenix once a year to visit my parents located in Goodyear, AZ. In order to save my wife and I a few dollars, I decided to avoid rentign from the airport wnterprise location, and try the local Goodyear location. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!! As my wife always tells me, you get what you paid for...how true. I was offered the choice, as an upgrade mind you, of the smallest, cars imanigable....I select a kia at first, drove it a mile, and promptly returned it..the seats felt like coffin lids...the car wrote erradicaly..Next, was my second choice, a chevy cobalt...the drivers seat sank to the left...the brake pads were obviously in poor condition, as in order to stop, additional pressure was required on the brakes....but the worst was yet to come..\n\n   The same night after renting the checy cobalt, I went o gas up the tank, as the car renta agency only left the car with less than a quarter of a tan of gas!!! Unhreard of....as I went to shut the car off, it would not allow me to...the key was stuck in the on position!!! Long story short, I get th car back on empty to my parents, and ask my step father, who's aformer car mechanic to get the key out and the car off..he could not do it..he had to disable the car, by pulling a few enginen cables loose, which left the headlights still on!!!! In the interim I was o nthe phone with Enterprise's \""emergency\"" road side assistance..I spoje to two different operators..opne had the nerve to laugh hystericaly in my ear at my situation, telling me that they have trouble similar to mine wit hthe chevy cobalt's that they rebnt..Sothat is funny to charge the public for cars you know are unsafe? I think not jackass.\n\n     The the emergency operator after finishing his chuckle routine....told me that they will onoly send trippl e A out to tow their car, once the enginen has stoped...in the meantime we were stil trying to get the enginen off..before my step father figured out how to....I asked the phone operator, am I supposed to drive around untilthe car runs out of gas i nthe desert at 11 pm???? Or leave it here i n my parent's dtiveway,t hy reside in an upscale gated golf community...the noise was disturing their neighbors, from the car running, and the exhaust fumes smelled like exhaust fumes..awful. An hour later the tow truck guy heads out, he's lost, as he's from chandler, located a distance away...he gets there..and says oh no...curing under his breath...they toldme at entrprise that the car was in the street...I had just had it then...the tow guy and I physicaly pushed the car into the street..after midnight now this car was out of my life...I thought!!! \n\n   The next day the Goodyear enterprise sent out a rep. with a really nice, new mazda....but it did not have an aux ipod jack...ok, no biggie..this car was sweet....ran well, looked good, etc.... I was assurd my oneday rntal was free, the remaning four days reduced to half price...great!!! I return the car four days later,. on time, in mint condition, with a full tank of gas..they gave it to me initaly with 1/3 tank filled....the car was fine, but the price discount they quoted me was incorrect..they lied straight to my face at the rental location in Goodyear-claiming they nevrt guarnteed me 4 days at half price, onlyone!!! So after ome debate it was reduced afew dollars, that was it..I just wanted to get home, and on my flight a few hours later....Once back at home I wrote to the enterprise Corp..a rep. from the main branch in Phoenix phoned me ... he was on the ball this guy, agreed with all of my complants...gave me the full agreed upon 1/2 price with ad ay free rental..car cost me under 70.00 for 5 days..but man, the hassels involved left a sour taste in my mouth....I would not recomend the Goodyear location...they are incompetant at best, and non trustworthy. I've had better luck with other Enterprises around the country. Thy are not all as corrupt as this one....it was alearning experience to say the least.\n\nPS. As I was checkignout of the Goodyear enterprise location, a fellow customer was complaning that his rental car from them,t he same location had bad brakes, he believed the car was once in an accident!!! I shook his hand."
2,"Really, I'm very much over the Las Vegas buffet. After almost five years in this town you start to realize that 95% of the food at 95% of the buffets is pretty much interchangeable. And most of it isn't all that good, especially when you're paying full price. So I'm going to be a tough grader when it comes to buffets.\n\nFortunately, the Station Feasts are discounting all month so Sunday brunch was $11.95, an acceptable price to pay.\n\nThe food was OK - better than average for a buffet, fairly fresh but generally unremarkable for better or for worse. Decent variety, with nice touches including roasted jalapeno peppers on the Mexican station, a really good pesto pasta salad, smoked salmon and bagels, and kielbasa. The hand-sliced prime rib was decent, although I had to ask twice to get the size and cut that I wanted. Station also does desserts really well. You can't go wrong with any of them.\n\nTwo things of note about this visit.\n\n1) Station loses a star for the decision to limit guests to two glasses of cheap swilly \""champagne\"" at brunch. What the hell? When I first moved to town, getting half in the bag on barely drinkable sparkling wine was half the fun of getting up on a Sunday morning. I'm sure the bean counters were on their butts about the amount of free champagne they were pouring, but come on! The stuff is dirt cheap and since when are casinos stingy about getting their guests drunk?\n\n2) The friendliness and customer focus of my server gets that star back. She always had a smile, was quick to bring me fresh silverware (without asking) or top off my drinks. She even brought me a third glass of champagne in spite of Station's dumb new brunch policy. I've always thought that even though buffet servers are probably among the most underappreciated of industry workers, the ones you find at Station's Feast buffets across the city tend to be very pleasant and friendly, so much so that you wonder why they're not working for a real restaurant. This was no exception.\n\nSlightly above average food, well above average service, tainted by obvious parsimony that probably manifests itself behind the scenes in ways that give me pause about ingredient quality, etc."
1,"The search to find a place that even compares to our favorite, Grand Dragon, continues. Tasty house just doesn't measure up, the Kung pao is flavorless, the egg rolls are just blah and the dumplings greasy. Another one bites the dust."
3,"My dad makes the BEST taco's In the WORLD, then Taqueria De Anda In Fullerton CA, then Pepe's In 3rd place. you want to order fresh \""agua de Pina or Jaimaca\"" (Pineapple juice or hibiscus tea) to down the \""Taco's de pastor\"" (marinated pork Tacos). Try the Carne Asada Fries...It's The Real Thing!!!"
1,"I like the complex it's very quit and calm.\nI should really be giving this place 1 star though because their maintenance is horrible I've been here for 6 months and have had a problem with a leak that wets my carpet and smells really bad. Every time I speak with the manager she says it's been fixed yet it rains again and I find myself with the same problem. I've expressed to her my concerns about the leak, holes in doors, non working closet doors, and it has not been fixed. I think waiting 6 months for repairs is ridiculous. They should really replace the manager and get someone else."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!  Called ahead to find out how much a blow out costs...they told me $40...got to the appointment and it was $70.  They told me that I could go somewhere else if I didn't like the price, but I had somewhere to be an hour later so I was stuck.  Got the worst blow out I have ever recieved...I could have done a better job with a blindfold on..This place has horrible customer service and horrible stylists!!"
4,Best ramen I've ever had! Fresh ramen noodles are SO GOOD! This place is really delicious. It's become really popular so there will often be a wait but it usually doesn't take long because the food comes out really fast. I especially love the tonkotsu broth.
1,"I have been here several times with friends who live in the area, not really by my choice. The food is decent, but the service is always terrible. Even when they are not busy, the service is slow. I have seen the owner be rude to other patrons, and there is not much positive personality in the place.  Also had some friends called derogatory names by the cooks when an order was prepared incorrectly and sent back. The cleanliness is also questionable.  I have never had a good experience here, and now even refuse to go along if my friends are going here. There are too many similar and good restaurants near this place to ever spend my hard earned money here."
1,"Worse club ever. Took forever to get into even though we were in the very front of the line.\n\nUgly girls, not so skinny girls, old girls, and rude security guys with super annoying flashlights. Super expensive drinks... Jager bombs are $17!? WTF.\n\nI'm only giving it two stars because of the cool/hot bartenders and the three seperate dance floors which each have a whole different vibe."
1,"If you are a smoker then this is the best bar in town.  I am a ex-smoker so the outdoor second hand did not bother me, but if you are picky then sit inside.  What did bother me was the service.  Our server seemed too cool and it took forever to get a drink order in let alone our tab when finished.\n\nIt is a shame that the service was lacking as this spot is super cool, and as my wife would say \""cute.\""  The balcony and outdoor seating is perfect and I can see why there are people here consistently.  The food, and this is from a take out point of view, was blah.  We wanted the potato skins (which they were out of) so ended up taking home a Reuben.  The Reuben was put on 2 pieces of white bread, so weird.  The meat was OK but that bread just put me off. \n\nOh well, win some loose some.  Maybe I will give it another try when wanting a drink and some second hand smoke.  Either way, cool place for the college/hipster crowd, but just didn't work for me."
3,"Possibly was the time of year that we went but we went when they opened and the lines were very short. yet there were enough people there to feel like you weren't in an abandoned theme park. The rides look clean and well maintained. We had a great time, I love the indoor with outdoor feel of the place. It was really nice to walk around in (when it was 100 degrees outside) All and all the price was reasonable for the value you got in the dome (the all day pass is the way to go)"
3,"Nice, clean, quiet. Was in LV for business and appreciated that this hotel wasn't crazy at all hours--also, non-smoking. Staff were very pleasant. If I were forced to go back to Las Vegas I'd probably stay here again."
3,"Lovely shop, such a nice mix of new, old and handcrafted - super staff - the nicest people!  and  always new things to check out."
4,"This is a really great bar to stop into while exploring the South Side of Pittsburgh. Established and reputable, The Library is a very nice bar. The downstairs is generally busy; however, it's possible to get some peace and quiet if you head upstairs where they have another bar and even more rotating craft beers. \n\nThe craft beer selection is good and generally has good, reliable beers to try. When the draft isn't to your liking, check out the bottle selection. \n\nCan't attest to the food as I haven't yet tried it. \n\nOne other thing to note was the fact that on my way out, the owner of the place ran downstairs to check his stock of beers that he keeps for himself and friends. Among them he found a 2010 Founders Breakfast Stout that he offered to me just because we had a good conversation about beer. He's a very generous guy and obviously cares for his customers and retains a passion for good craft beer. I'd recommend a place with such an owner to anyone. Be sure to check it out."
0,"Most likely won't stay here again because of the experience.\nEven though the price is great, the trouble wasn't worth it.\n\nI discovered bed bugs on my bed, so I slept with my clothes on.\nToo tired to complain that day since I've been walking everywhere.\nOn top of that, the front desk accidentally charged me twice for my room..\nI caught the first one when I was checking out. They refunded me for the first one, then I realized they charged me again once I got back to my hometown.\nI had to email billing dispute and wait for another week for a reply & a refund.\nToo much problem & the bed was filthy. Gross. Make sure to check your bed, cause I always do.\n\nWon't be coming back."
2,Was extremely disappointed here.  Just never connected with the staff and som.  Food was OK.  Overpriced and over-hyped.  Best part of the evening was hanging in the bar before dinner.
1,"We ordered drinks and waited for them for over 30 minutes. Waitress 1 stopped by. Once we said we hadn't received them, she said she would follow up. Waitress 2 stopped by and said she would follow up, but no luck.\n\nBoth of them walked by our table multiple times afterwards and saw we didn't have our drinks. Never got our drinks so we found another bar nearby. \n\nSeemed like a cool place (hence 2 stars instead of 1) but didn't get to experience it."
1,"Boyfriend & I got 2 meals for $11.\n\nThat's about all I can say about this place. The food is basically fast food diner style. I probably would only go here if I wanted to be waited on. Or if I was 16 and wanted to go on a date (there were several cute little couples here, on Valentines day!)."
0,"This bar is in the middle of the casino floor at Aria. Coming here has made me actually consider what I consider to be serviceable service.\n\nWe walked in and immediately had no idea of whether or not we should sit at the bar, or in the comfy looking lounge seats encircling the bar. There was a buxom waitress whose goal it seemed to be to ignore absolutely everyone unless they trekked over to her and told her something.\n\nShe'd stare out into the floor for long stretches, looking for something. Maybe a lost love. Maybe she was thinking about politics.\n\nI went up to her after the requisite 7.5 minutes and asked her, \""do we ask you for\ndrinks or do we get them from the bartender?\"" \n\nShe said, \""I can take your order or you can get them from the bartender!\""\n\nWarning sign. \n\nAnyway I ordered from her and she carded us which somehow made me feel better. Our drinks came after another 7.5 minutes and they were good. We paid cash and expected change because it was more than a typical tip and she said she'd be right back. And we probably wanted another drink. However, she never came back, so after 7.5 minutes waiting for to her to come back after finishing our drinks, we left. \n\nAnd she said as we were leaving, \""bye guys! thanks for coming.\""\n\nFelt like theft. So I think that's my definition  of bad service. This is some kind of anti-service game that City Bar is playing that has made me question my reason for existence. They ignore you, and then ignore you extra-hard if you've succeeded in getting their attention at least once.\n\nGood for philosophy majors I guess. I don't know for sure because I wasn't one.\n\nSo many better places to drink alcohol in the world."
2,"When it comes to pedicures, I'm no expert but I would give them top scores. They are super friendly, did a great job and feet looked fantastic. I don't understand why it adds $5 to work on your calluses but ok. It seemed like there was a lot of add-on pricing and they definitely pushed additional services but then again, it is a business.\n\nFor the manicure, I was super happy when I first got it and they seem to use top quality materials but my nails started lifting around the cuticles within a week. It was my first time getting nails in 10 years so I thought maybe it was me. They told me to wash my hands less and it took about 2 weeks to start lifting the second time. Maybe it is worth it to pay a little more elsewhere?"
1,"The experience here was so overwhelmingly sucky that I didn't even want to exhaust myself further by writing a review. Weighing only 110 pounds I'll probably lose 3 writing a review on La Comida, but I love YELP. Being that I wouldn't want anyone else to waste their hard earned money after dining at this establishment, I decided to do the good deed anyway! First of all the ambiance is really nice, I won't knock that at all. I will however dive right on in to say that the service stunk to high heaven. The waitress was combative and had more attitude than the law should allow, and this place couldn't get an order right to save their lives. What's more, they jacked up the billing transactions and overcharged my parties debit cards after we told them 3 times how we wanted the pricing broke down. (Screaming: LORD HAVE MERCY KELLY CLARKSON EDDIE MURPHY!!!) Needless to say, my visit here to celebrate a small bachelorette gathering left me livid by the end of the night. Of course I brought it to the manager's attention, and he in return threw in some extra desserts. Though, I would have preferred to have a much sweeter waitress than under-sweetened flan and tres leches cake. I say don't waste the time or energy on this place.  Just keep walking....and go on to Casa Don Juan, their authentic Mexican Cuisine is the truth baby!"
2,The bread was very good.   The sandwich (pastrami) was just average.\n\nPrices are all reasonable and a pretty large menu.  I'm guessing  (hoping)  some of the asian sandwiches  rise above average.\n\nProbably  a 3.5.
4,I went to the buffet with me family to eat the buffet that i told my other family member's you know we paid to get in $29 dollars *6 adults $21 per kid *7 separate checks what have you. I go up and the girl/host tells me i need to pay additional% because i have too many people with me. So she split us up. which is fine. but not at two opposite ends of the place. Otherwise meal was Good enjoy this buffet.
2,"It was an ok place to stay for Thanksgiving weekend. I didn't like that we had to pay a resort fee, especially when the rooms were already a little pricey. We had broken lights in our room we got charged a mini bar fee when we didn't even get the key. Now how does that happen? It was especially difficult to get them to refund it. I highly doubt I'll go back. All I can say is I'd rather stay here than Motel 6, but that's not saying much."
1,"I am sad to have to give a poor review to one of my favorite restaurants going back 9 years. It appears the owner has decided to turn it into a quasi-night club, with a DJ and music turned up to extremely loud. But at 830 pm?? How can anyone enjoy a meal with friends when everyone is shouting and straining to hear? Bad choice Mr. Owner. When I complained, the staff responded quite apologetically (they seem to know about the problem), but were not able to get the sound lowered to acceptable levels. My speaking up about this earned me several high fives from other patrons. But where were all the customers? Place was unusually empty..... Oh yeah, the disco atmosphere drove people away. If the situation is corrected, I will gladly update this review. Aside from excess noise, food was great (as usual), and the staff were friendly and charming."
2,"Sorry guys, it really shouldn't take 30 minutes to make 2 small vegan tacos. There were a couple people that ordered dine-in ahead of me, but when their food came out, it looked like everyone had ordered some form of salad, so that's even less reason for the preparation to be so slow!\n\nThat being said, the tortillas tasted and looked freshly made. The taco ingredients were tasty, with a vibrant pleasing look. I really liked the spices and seasoning in the walnut meat mixture, and the tomatoes and micro-cilantro were very fresh. The salsa had a touch of spice which livened up the meal, and the sesame cucumber side was refreshing.\n\nThe pay system is through an i-pad where you have the option of adding tip to your meal right when you order, which I always find weird. How can I adequately add tip to service which I haven't even received yet? (I usually don't carry enough cash to tip in cash after the end of my meal either- I usually leave it up to the credit card)"
2,"This is decent, average Chinese food.  Nothing great, but certainly nothing bad.  Possibly a tad over-priced for the quality, but not the quantity."
0,"I stayed at Aria for the first time last week. I had requested 2 rooms on a high floor. We arrived late. The front desk lady said that all the high floor rooms were taken by the convention that was in town. She said she had a room on the 8th fl. I said that wouldn't do so she found, lol, 2 rooms on the 15th floor. The room looked at the convention center roof. They have 56 floors so you know where we were. She also told me that for what I was paying that was a good room. They sent me a special room rate. Why do they send it if you shouldn't use it. The floors are dirty and the bathtub/shower is stupid. Stay at The Cosmo or Vdara."
3,"Tamari was amazing!  The food, drinks, bartending staff, atmosphere were all top-notch!  Now, why I only gave it 4 stars vs. 5...the wait to get in!!  We were told 2 hours to wait...now I can wait, even with the little bit of patience of I have, but TWO HOURS!!  And to add to that, people near us in the bar had been waiting 2.5 hrs and they got there at 5pm (Saturday).  Luckily, we were able to eventually snag four seats together at the upstairs lounge and ordered dinner at the bar.\n\nAtmosphere: I love the look...very hip & trendy!  Just a tad on the small side but the decor was money!  Crowd is sophisticated and mature...meaning if someone accidentally knocked into you, they apologized!  I know crazy, right!?!?!?\n\nDrinks: You MUST try the Tamari-tini...it was perfect.  My friend got the infused vodka and it was definitely unique...i think it was infused with pepper, and apparently there is a new flavor every month!!  \n\nFood: We ordered the Robata Combo...it was really great!  The dipping sauces were tasty...well I unforunately couldn't eat the green sauce because it was a tad spicy for me (i'm a total wimp!) We also had the Tamari specialty roll (one of the better rolls i've had in Pittsburgh), Calamari (light and crispy), Lobster MacNChz (big chunks of lobster) and the mushroom salad.  Everything was amazing...I would recommend them all.  Oh and the bacon and quail egg kabob was awesome!!  \n\nDessert: We had the Green Tea Cake and some chocolate deal that was spicy...the chocolate cake was my least favorite thing we ordered all night.  That I wouldn't recommend. \n\nTamari was very enjoyable, even after having to dine at the bar!  I'm hoping that next time I'll be able to get a table before the sun comes up!"
0,"My wife and I usually goto The Coffee Shop at Joe's Farm but today we tried The Bold Roost. My first clue shoulda been the lack of customers. Anyway, we order our usual iced coffee Americanos. I was kinda surprised at the $8+ charge but was anticipating a great drink. We were sadly disappointed! Our drinks were so watered down we couldn't be sure there was even any espresso in them. I literally took mine outside looking for a trash can. Ended up dumping them in the bushes. Fear not, we took the cups with us and threw away at The Coffee Shop at Joe's Farm. BTW, two amazing Americanos were $6."
2,"Sunday brunch was $31 (including tax and 18% tip because I came with a party of 7), and the main reason we came was for the prime rib. It's really depends on what cut you get; my friend had part of the middle which was dry, but the BF had the side which was super flavorful and moist. He even got a little bit of fat which made it that much better. \n\nThe other plus from the meal was the omelet station. We went for an egg white only omelet that was exceptionally good; I regret not getting a second. Other than that, nothing particularly stood out. I liked the broccolini, caesar salad, the glazed carrots, and the dessert (caramel flan). The french toast was really dry and the fish was overcooked. I do like the fact that there is a lot to choose from, and our server was very attentive which made the experience (slightly) better."
2,"They have fries?!\n\nI pose this question because of the pictures I saw on Yelp; I got ruffles on the side with my order.\n\nAnyway, El Guero is a nice little Torta shop that does have a pretty decent torta. I got the Cuban and it was really good. I didn't see anything on the menu that really stood out to me though besides the Cuban. The conchinita won one of the best sandwiches in Phoenix Magazine in the past, so I will be back to try it eventually. But, with some tough competition in town, it's hard to say when I'll be making it back."
4,"Wonderful food! Great variety of meat options, the steak is especially good! My favorite dish is the enchiladas verdes full meal with lack beans. All the food is nice and fresh. Really recommend it :)"
2,"The hotel is nice, with one bedroom suites that are larger than an average hotel room.  The gold sinks were a little dated, and my tv did not work until I played with the cables, but that was not a big deal.  I would give the place four stars, but the breakfast buffet was 20 dollars, which I think is just a crime.  I had a fruit plate, a small amount of eggs, and ended up paying nearly 25 dollars with tax and tip.  They might get away with this because most people are there on business and not really paying for it, but it really bothered me.  The pool is also a little small for a resort type place in this location, and I don't like the wall that keeps you from seeing the pool when you are in the hot tub."
1,"Went there for a staff lunch. Ordered the wings (buffalo) , and the 16oz. Rib eye. Wings where awesome cooked right and extra sauce. Server was struggling but food came out and of course my medium steak was well done. Finally for to send it back and got a new one. They took care of my wings and I got a decent steak."
4,"Definitely lives up to the hype!  We visited Sprinkles three times on our recent trip to LV.  We sampled red velvet, coconut, black and white, orange, carrot cake and milk chocolate varieties with red velvet being our absolute favorite.  We took advantage of the cupcake atm and absolutely loved the concept.  We will definitely visit Sprinkles every time we're in Vegas."
2,Overpriced average italian food. Made for tourist.\n\nNice location. Can this be considered dining al fresco?
0,"I'm a bit of a foodie but I have to say that this place is pretty whack. Way too much hype, way to pricey, and portions way to much. I couldn't even tone down the portions. Food looks good coming out, but there's no flavor. I love eggs Benedict & I thought this twist wouldwould be cool but biscuits and mashpotatoes? I couldn't get a poached egg upon request. No flavor from the entire meal. This is not my first time going there. I've tried @least4 times. Customer service is horrible. Don't waste your time and money"
2,"Lets start off that oyshi sushi is one of those places in Vegas that has really good sushi and appetizers. There is alot of things to choose from and all of there sushi taste hella bomb.com lol. Due to the fact it taste pretty fresh and its tasty. And I love the fact this place is All you can eat for the price. The only downside is the deserts isn't all you can eat. But it's all good after eating a gripload of sushi, all you need is a order of one of there deserts, which they are also bomb diggity lol. I also like the fact that this place is very nice and clean\n\nNow here's is why I did not give this place all 5 stars.  The reason is there service. It's a hit or miss with this place. Unfortunately there is like one or two servers who are freaking awesome as hell with there customer service and always brings food out really quick. I can't really say for the other staff members. It seems most of them got a attitude problem or something when you order and are hella slow. It which is kinda sad. Hope they start changing soon cause its kinda hard to go back when you have a couple of bad experiences with a place."
0,"If I could add negative stars I would. This is one of the worst gay bars I have ever been to. The venue is small, service sucks, unfriendly staff, and weak drinks. Even for Vegas most bars pour a good drink. When will the hype of this new gay club stop. Gays!!! Go back to Krave!!!"
2,"It's hard not to root for this neighborhood breakfast spot.  In Feb they had weekday (Tues to Fri) breakfast specials for less than 4 dollars.  You can get waffles, pancakes, or French toast paired with eggs for less than what you would pay at Denny's.  The food is not elevated, high-end cuisine by any means but for the value you're getting a great home cooked breakfast.  The biscuits were also definitely good paired with the gravy.\n\nThe reason I can't give it 4 or 5 stars is based on service.  Now typically I don't really care about service as long as it's not horrible and if I get good food. If service were better I d give it 4 stars tops.  We came on a Sun with only one other table.  The server couldn't multi-task worth sh1t and neither could the cook who was apparently working his first shift.  They were nice though I have to say.\n\nIf I lived closer I would frequent more often and may come to find that this visit was an outlier to what type of service you would expect and thus my rating would be higher.  \n\nIf you're in the area - check this place out. You really can't beat the value - no item is over 9 dollars with most items being 5-6 dollars.  My guess is this is more along the lines of 4 stars but I came on a bad day."
3,"A year ago we stayed here as our first Fremont Street hotel.  We were really impressed by the rooms and the bar/restaurant.  We tried another hotel on the street a few months later, similar price, the Four Queens definitely stood out as the best deal.  We are heading there tomorrow for our second stay and are really looking forward to it."
3,"This is more of a 3.5 star review, but there were a few things that made me round up rather than down.\n\n1) You can't go wrong with a Yelp coupon. Buy one get one free? Yes please! To take advantage of the coupon, check in and BAM! Coupon appears. I love it when that happens.\n\n2) The frozen yogurt is good! There are a lot of selections - both of the fruit and confectionery varieties - and the flavors are very tasty. I didn't like it as much because I realized I'm more of a sorbet girl. But on that note, they have one super tasty \""country lemonade\"" sorbet available.\n\n3) It's hard to beat the location. Plus, the outdoor seating is just perfect on a chilly, rainy Phoenix evening. I suppose it's a little weird to be eating frozen desserts on a night when I was bundled up more than normal (I had on a scarf), but I certainly wasn't the only Phoenician enjoying a frozen delight outdoors in November."
1,"I have bought a couple bikes here but that is mostly because Champaign Cycle was too far away and BIkeworks is never open when he says he will be, super run down and condescending. I went in to Durst to look at their used bikes. I wanted a women's cruiser. The only one they had was a huffy Panama Jack for $129 (used!). I checked online and it retails new for $149! I've also had trouble getting help when I go there, perhaps because I'm not wearing spandex even though I ride my bike more than 95% of the general population."
0,"I am getting sick and tired of restaurants in this economy that don't know how to treat a customer.  It is not like they are over flowing with customers at best 1/4 filled.  I ordered the Croque Madam  when it came out the egg yolk was ice cold.  I asked the waiter if he could replace the egg.  Rather than just bring out a new sandwich the waiter came out and essentially blamed me and said the cook said that the egg was not cold.  Now I am irritated and ask to speak to the manager, a few minutes later, the so called executive chef comes out and continues to insult me.\n\nDon't waste your time with this restaurant, food is sub par the executive chef is clueless and the service is even worse.  They should just close the entire Aliante Casino.  It is one of the worst Casinos to eat at or gamble at."
2,"With coupon and gift card in hand, we ventured to this chain restaurant for a Monday afternoon lunch.\n\nHubby had the Jack Daniels steak with cheddar mashed potatoes, while I munched on fish & chips.  All in all, not too bad.  Add to that a couple of side salads and a couple of drinks and our bill was over $25.00 (even with the buy one, get one free coupon).  Certainly not what we were expecting.\n\nThe hostess who showed us to our table was polite, but definitely devoid of personality.  Oh, how I miss the days of meaningless small talk & professionalism!  Our server was very attentive and actually did an above-average job.  \n\nIf this particular location wasn't so darn convenient for us, we probably would have gone somewhere else.  But, optimistic as we may be, our thought was an early-bird style lunch on a Monday -  would be much better.\n\nWill we return? Maybe.\nWould we recommend?  I don't know. We still kinda prefer the Mom&Pop restaurants and supporting our community."
3,"Love this place! KIC roll is to die for if you like spicy rolls. Squid salad, sunshine roll, all the sashimi on happy hour....perfect! The cucumber drink (alcoholic beverage) was great!!! Excellent service and ambiance. So impressed! :)"
2,"Unfortunately this place will, for the foreseeable future, be compared to Palette (the former occupant of this space). \n\nSo I will start with the decor, and as expected, Palette took all the character with them leaving Local Breeze with a hollowed out core. Equally gone are the hip and beautiful staff. The way cool bathroom and outdoor patio dinning remain.\n\nAs for the food. Good! \n\nI had the Firecracker Shrimp and a hamburger ... both were good. The fries weren't bad either.  Beer prices at  $4 seems fair.\n\nI just don't know what to make of this place. I will update once I go back (and try the steak)."
4,"I just..I mean how can I..well it's...Delicious!\n\nA jewel of a location in Charlotte.  I only had a day in Charlotte and I visited here twice...really.  I grabbed a quick croissant to go after hitting town from Raleigh.  After my first bite & then a post on Facebook that generated several comments...such as get the salted caramel brownie and many others I knew I would be stopping by on my way out of town.\n\nI did.  And had beautiful sugar shock during my drive back.\n\nMacaroons, fruit tarts, and that brownie...I tried a little of each and saved some for another day.\n\nOpen 24 hours.  Really."
2,"This place is a no frills.  You're going in for a brat and beer, you'll get that.  There isn't anything fancy here, there are TVs though."
0,"Craving a thin crust Pizza Hut pizza last night I called this place at 8PM for a delivery..They were out of pizza,yes out of thin crust pizza...I said that's like McDonalds being out of cheeseburgers,and was hung up on!? Unbelievable!"
0,"ummm if you want a good burger go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Planet Hollywood across the street.\n\nWe stayed at the Mirage and there always seemed to be a line for BLT, it was convenient so we thought we would give it a go. Well the service was crap, the waitress never came by barely spoke to us......  I got the Tex Mex burger and it was like dripping in sweet BBQ sauce, gross..... not very good at all, I had two bites..... We also tried the nacho basket, just a soggy mess of more sweet BBQ over chips..... I am from South Texas and like my shit hot! So maybe I am just spoiled by good nachos.... who knows but if you are excepting good food stay away, if you don't really care then go for it.... You'll be wasting $100 for two people..... But maybe you are rich and don't care.  I blame this restaurant for giving me the worst hangover ever.... Thanks a lot Obama!"
2,"Bagels are fantastic!  Service varies, usually just okay.  Bathrooms are so bad they are creepy - just avoid even looking in there, it is like a horror flick.\nNice place to go on a Saturday if you don't mind a limited selection or an afternoon when there are less patrons.  Just leave before you have to \""go\""."
2,I finally got a chance to see this show yesterday.\nAs many reviewers state before this is not an ice/skating show (even though a couple guys skate pretty good and do some tricks). It is mostly acrobatics performed on ice rink. \nSo since I'm not the greatest show critic I'll just tell few things (but still take my opinion with a grain of salt)\n\n- few parts were too stretched out and I was almost about to nap on my friend's shoulder :)\n- not really a con but theater is rather small so choose seats closer to the center.\n- guys really need to smile more during show\n- clowns were somewhat boring\n+ girls are great looking!
1,"After the comment I received after my review, I checked my inbox and indeed had a message regarding my visit. They asked for additional information about the visit and further contact info which I provided. I never heard any further feedback."
2,"Great central location and convenient showtimes.\n\nNot my favorite theatre near Henderson as it's a little dated- not the best sound or picture quality. That said, I would go back if they were showing the movie that I wanted to see at the time I wanted to see it and I didn't have the option of Green Valley Ranch 10.\n\nCan be a little tricky navigating between the parking lot and the movie theatre (especially from the theatre to the parking lot).\n\nHad an employee at the concession stand scrutinize my credit card and driver's license so long that I thought he was trying to memorize both."
3,This room was glorious.  We stayed on a Sunday night and it was the greatest room ever.  We managed to get a room overlooking the strip and it looked amazing at night.  The bed was comfortable the couch was comfortable.  The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because the hot tub was designed for midgets.  Otherwise a great place to stay and a great deal on weekdays as well.
4,"Everything about the meal was excellent. I ordered the surf and turf which was amazing and my date ordered 2 pounds (yes, TWO pounds!) of crablegs and oyster shooters. Everything tasted absolutely amazing. Service was amazing. Atmosphere great. Definitely 5 stars, nothing to complain about.\n\nTip: Be prepared to drop some $$$ though! Well worth it though!"
3,"So we'd been here before, and it's been quite some time. We decided to go back tonight because I was REALLLLLY craving some Asian noodles. We got the Singapore rice noodles with chicken, shrimp, egg, onion and curry. We also went with my fave chinese appetizer (if done right) BBQ beef. The BBQ beef here is great, very close to what I'd get at home (By home, I mean Seattle..best Asian food in the US). The noodle dish was pretty good too. it's exactly like this one dish that wifey and I used to get at Big Wong's (when they were open) called Hamun Rice Noodles. We have been searching for a comparable dish, and alas we've found it. Overall the food was good, and came with plenty (plus I have a before-I-go-to-class-tomorrow-evening snack. Excited to go back again to try some other stuff on the ginormous menu (that's a huge Bit**)"
1,"I think there is a lot better food to be had in Charlotte. \n\nThis place definitely has a romantic vibe going; its just that the food is not that good. Wasn't memorable, exciting or impressive. \n\nWould pass up in favor of something better."
4,"It was a cold and stormy night. No, seriously, it was! On Sunday, the last day of our Vegas trip, the thunderstorm happened and it happened while I was at the outlets. So many wonderful options at this location! Bought stuff at the Disney Store, BR, and White House | Black Market. If it wasn't for the downpour, I would've shopped more. They have a great selection of retailers...even one that carries the out of stock items from Disneyland itself! (I can vouch for it since I've seen those merchandise items before on a monthly basis at Disneyland.)"
0,"This is BY FAR THE WORST POST OFFICE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! The box clerk, Bette, is literally insane and needs to be not only fired but institutionalized for the criminally insane! Since October, this insane control freak has RETURNED ALL MY MAIL! I inquire at the post office and they tell me to call and talk to her which takes WEEKS because she leaves early EVERY DAY. When I finally get her on the phone, she tells me, \""I returned ALL your mail and I DON'T CARE IF YOU EVER GET ANY MAIL!\"" Then says, \""FUCK YOU\"" AND HANGS UP ON ME! \n\nI call back to speak to the postmaster and NONE of the employees will put him on the phone! They won't take a complaint and continually hang up on me! I literally had to file a postal complaint to get ANY mail and now I'm getting mail from October! NONE of the mail I've mailed from here has been delivered! I guess tampering with mail is only a federal offense if anyone cares to enforce it! \n\nThis post office should be shut down and Bette the box clerk should be prosecuted!"
3,"*****This place calling itself Bachi Burger may throw some off it's Bao meets, Boba, meets grillarama****** \n\nI wish these guys had got in before the Subway on the corner of the building it's a much better spot. The interior is really not to my liking too stark and boring. They are new so this may change but it really seems like it was the look that they were going for. The staff was nice though the waitresses seemed nervous and uncomfortable it's all new so I am looking past all of this. I had the Kalbi burger it was really good I'm a kimchi fan so it was right up my alley. This thing is messy as hell in a good way 4 napkin minimum. My only wish on my burger was that they use a rougher cut of Kimchi. The salt and pepper fries are solid they toss a few jalapenos in for effect as well. On the drinks side they have a good selection of beers although they are a little up there in price if I'm paying 7 dollars for a Sapporo it had better be a large format bottle. I will definitely go back if for nothing else to tear through all the Bao selections and have an order of fish & chips. One note, the buns are a little sweet and may throw some off, I thought they were great and very fresh."
4,"This is by far the BEST buffet you will EVER go to. I love that they are always cranking out individual dishes so that you know its fresh made. Not just sitting in a hotel pan wondering how long its been there, determined by the skin formed on the top. They even shuck oysters in front of you. My husband and I went there in November a few months after they opened on a tuesday night. We waited way OVER an hour and it was worth it, we paid $98 for both and at the time if you pay an extra $15 I think I saw its unlimited wine and beer."
4,Amazing place to meet amazing people. The only place with true authentic German beer.
2,"This should be a 4 star review but because of a wine snafu it goes down to 3. Mezzo is an attractive place that serves mostly very good food. They pride themselves as a wine bar and I sense we got a little \""bait and switch\"" the other night. we are NOT wine experts by any means. their blackboard lists wine bottles for the evening and the first 2 or 3 least expensive wines were already \""gone\"" by our 6:30 start time. I could be wrong..but I sensed the waiter and bartender were in \""cahoots\""  in giving us a sub par wine. what we did get was  OK...but not what we wanted. Wife didn't like her salad much but the rest of the food was fine. I had a pasta fagioli soup which was very tasty. wife had some kind of 3 cheese chicken croquette appetizer. My veal parm with penne was excellent...wife's eggplant parm was quite good. crowd is quite loud..music too loud also....prices very reasonable but that wine deal left me feeling...not quite right."
0,"My two friends and I, all three of us teachers for CCSD, went out yesterday to celebrate the close of a successful school year. Anticipating that we would be drinking, we took a taxi to and from the downtown restaurant we had chosen. On our way home, we were picked up by Whittlesea Blue, cab number 5004 (we did not get the name of the driver, unfortunately), and directed him to our home address.\n\nOur house is located off of a major intersection but is in a neighborhood with a slightly complicated layout, so we attempted to direct the driver toward the simplest route. He pulled the cab over and began raising his voice to us, telling us that he has been doing his job for seven years and doesn't need help. When we told him that we just wanted to go home, he still refused to to bring the car back on the road and repeatedly asked \""Are we doing it your way or my way? Because when your way ends up costing $50, you have to pay for it.\"" We finally told him to just take the route he had planned to take, and all told the ride cost $10 more than it had on our way out for the evening.\n\nOperating a taxi is a form of customer service, and it is completely unacceptable to raise one's voice to or argue with a customer who has been neither belligerent nor disrespectful. Likewise, it is equally inappropriate to purposely run up the meter on taxi fare, either by taking a longer route or by letting it run whilst the driver is pulled over to berate the passengers, both of which our driver did last night.\n\nI would rather walk three miles home in heels than take another ride from this company again. Stay away."
3,"Snagged a suite here for the weekend with my sweetie from a groupon and from the moment we arrived, I was impressed! From the free valet parking to the complimentary bottled water when checking in, everyone was so attentive and sweet! The room was gorgeous with a brilliant view of the strip. Everything was clean, and it included one if the most amazing bathroom layouts that I've seen! I want it in MY house!! Even when we accidentally locked ourselves out the staff was pleasant and more than willing to help us out. \n\nMy only complaint would be that it's a little far from the strip, but the MGM connects everything so well that it really isn't that big of a deal. I highly recommend staying here, it's a vacationers dream suite!"
2,"In some review said that this place have life music, I think its totally not fully right. I went there, and it just small place, although I like the light setting on the front.  No live music venues. \n\nI hope everyone didn't get confuse. I might be wrong too. I suggest better you called before you come there as I did:) \n\nRevised: 5/2/11\nHere is a quote from Mr. D - Tonic. \""Currently we have live music on Thurs, Friday, and Saturday. It usually starts around 9pm. I hope you can come back and see a show on one of those nights.\""\n\nThank you for quick response Mr. D and I will come again next time:)."
3,"Pizza Sola serves up one of the closest equivalents that I've found in Pittsburgh to the iconic New York-style slice.  The crust is the perfect mix of crisp yet chewy, and the right thickness.  I'd like a just a little more sauce and a slightly saltier mozzarella for a perfect plain slice--but I'd rather have Pizza Sola's version than the slices at some other places that have too much sauce and/or too salty cheese.\n\nSlices here range from $2.75 for a plain slice to about $4.50 for some of the fancier cuts.  You get your money's worth though.  The cuts are so large that a slice doesn't fit on a single paper plate--I received my huge slice laid across two overlapping plates.\n\nPizza Sola also advertises a $7 special for a 14-inch pizza after 8 pm with a student ID.  They also have wings and salads, but I know I'll always be coming here for the pizza."
2,"I was really prepared to not like this place.  I've been here a few times, never been wow'd, and it's probably been a good year since I've been last.  So when my co-wkr wanted to go, I quietly groaned.\n\nBut it wasn't bad, not at all.  I had the seared yellow tuna over salad, fish was a bit flavorless but the salad w/ sesame dressing was actually surprisingly tasty.  My friend ordered the Carribean salad, think basically HUGE fruit bowl for $10.  Order this if you're too lazy to chop a variety of fruit and eat that for breakfast for a few days in a row.  I kid you not."
2,"3 stars. Firm. However,,,\n\nThis is a sushi bar, not a izakaya - so, if you sit at the counter, and if the head/better chefs make sushi for you, it is really good. I give 4 stars.\n\nSome of the chefs aren't there yet,,, they are, to me, like these fakers who work for all you can eat sushi bar. The way they cut rolls is often terrible,,,. You don't wanna pay 25 bucks to get a roll when you can get all you can eat at the same price. I hope they hire better chefs.\n\nBeef tataki is terrific only if its fresh. Same for fish. I have eaten it several times and found out the consistency of the food quality is low. Sometimes it's good. Sometimes it's ok. This shouldnt happen at the place like this. \n\nLong story short, I say;\n\nGet sushi and sashimi. Period.\nThese westernized rolls are actually good, tho.\nSumeshi- sushi rice - is the best in town.\nBeef tataki is good, just ask the server if its really fresh or not.\n\n-Tempura isn't tempura. It's a fritter.\n-Chicken wings are good, but then you don't have to go to sushi place.\n-Shishito is plasticky... Is it from Mexico? It seems like they grew under the strong sunshine (this isn't good actually). Also, shishito is NOT that spicy. Maybe it's from red pepper farm...\n-Green Tea should be complimentary because that's what makes sushi taste better.(I understand its on the Strip, tho). No sushi bar in Japan charges tea. It's considered as rude. \n-If you sit at the bar, bartenders will let you sample beer from Japan. All of them are super good,,,, but only if you wanna spend 12 - 16 bucks for a glass of beer.\n-Sea eel, unagi, is too sweet,,, I hope they don't use that much sugar because quality of the eel itself is pretty good. \n-fried and not fried rice are ok. Again, this is sushi bar, not a Chinese restaurant\n. \n\nWell, this ain't short at all. Get sushi and sashimi. This ain't a japanese fusion restaurant."
2,"We went this weekend (last minute) during the Mayweather fight, so all the hotels were booked or overpriced. I've stayed in practically every 4-5 star hotel in vegas except for (Aria, Cosmopolitan and Encore) Of course if you can afford a 4/5 star hotel on the strip, then go for it!!!\nI got this off hotwire secret 4 star hotel deal, and was a bit skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised! Budget and family friendly hotel off the strip! It's not my favorite hotel, but worth every penny spent! \n\nWe were traveling with our son, so didn't want anything too crazy. Last trip (also during a popular fight), we stayed at Mandalay Bay which is nicer and also family friendly. But we enjoyed our time at the pool at South Point better, even though Mandalay has a lazy river and wave pool. At Mandalay it was extremely packed, we literally parked our stroller by the gate with our towels on top and people laying towels everywhere even on the concrete walkway by the gate surrounding the pool. Pool was overcrowded & the water was murkey. \n\nAt Southpoint, there were plenty of chairs to layout and enough space to swim! They had a kiddie pool which gets deeper in middle, so our toddlers (1&2yrs) and a 6 year old had fun in the same pool. There's a bar and mix of young and older crowd, but no way in the same crazy level as mgm, rehab pool etc. \n\nA lot of locals and my friends like gambling here, they have cheap table minimums and looser slots. $3 steak and eggs 12am - 6am. A movie theatre, bowling etc.\n\nOur room didn't have a view, but we only used it to sleep. The room was HUGE and clean! \n\nOnly downside it didn't have a fridge, which we needed. Also the resort fee is not  included in the hotwire price. Parking was easy, but we didn't like that we had to go through the casino to get to the room, but it wasn't too far of a walk. \n\nIt's off the 15 so a quick 5-10min drive to the strip. However if you came to vegas to party, you're better off getting something on the strip like the Cosmo etc. the crowd here is chill mostly adults, family, locals and a few partiers mixed in. But nothing wild, upscale."
1,"I come here a couple times every summer to catch 80's  hair metal bands that are past their prime. I always get lawn seats, which are super cheap for most shows, and then me and my friends pregame in the parking lot. It is usually a good time but I attribute that to good company and being able to tease the hell out of my hair. I really don't care for the venue at all. Half the time the screens on the lawn aren't on so you can't really see shit. The e-mails live nation sends out stating what is prohibited in the venue are usually wrong. For one show this year they sent out an email saying no blankets, towels or lawn chairs. Then when we got there everyone had blankets and chairs. Lame. The thing that pisses me off the most about this place though is that they charge $11 for a 24oz beer. A $3 increase from what they were charging last year. It's cool though, I've become a master at sneaking in mini bottles."
4,"love this place! one of the few restaurants in town with food that i'm not having second thoughts feeding my child. good food, good service."
3,"My husband and I lucked into one of the best dining experiences in a long time on a recent business trip to AZ. The hummous appetizer was exceptional, as was the \""what's in this steak?\"" dish, tender filet wrapped in yukon-gold potatoes (how comforting is THAT?). Nice selection of wine by the glass.  The only disappointment was a dessert referred to as a \""twist on Tiramisu,\"" but which bore no resemblance to it at all, with toffee cookie dough ice cream. I'll go back next time in town, but try a different dessert."
3,"Well, this is the place that got Centennial Toyota a star... it was that good! I admit that I'm an In N Out guy so I may be a little biased when it comes to burger places... but this place is a close second to In N Out. \n\nI give Smash Burger higher marks then \""5 Guys\"" because there is something about their burgers that stand out and is unique. I loved the egg buns and the Smash sauce was good, not quite In N Out's spread good but we were inspired to take my Girlfriends Dad back to Smash Burger the next day to try one. I loved that there were options when it came to sides, Smash Fries were ok, regular fries were better and the Onion Strings were awesome! Fries wise, SmashBurger has both 5 guys and In N Out beat! \n\nBonus points for having Cherry Coke (that worked) and Milk Shakes rather then peanuts. However, two people for lunch was just over $20 vs In N Out being about $12 so the value is still better at In N Out. I would say this, if Vegas didn't have an In N Out I would be just fine having Smash Burger as my substitute."
0,Bad bad experience... Got sold on a hand car wash to clean the mud from underneath. Came out with mud still caked on... And... They lost my antenna.. Why would you need to take the antenna off if you were going to hand wash it!!??? Save your obey.. Go the 5$ wash.
1,"Kaskade 8/18/12.  \n\nAs far as the layout, light show, dancers, performances, etc, Marquee definitely is an extremely solid 4.5.  The costumed dancers and the light show, man..what a great combo.  However in terms of managing the club itself, I had to bring it down to a 2.   To say you felt like a sardine in a can is an understatement.  You had girls crying, people throwing up because of the lack of air, literally being unable to move 10ft, etc.  Can't help but laugh about it , what a shit-show!\n\nHolding true to someone else's review, The biggest thing I would advise to everybody is to get a table.  Especially when the venue has a big DJ or other performer, Marquee Nightclub is best enjoyed when you have a table booked and have deep pockets to unload some cash.  You will be so happy with that decision as you see other people suffering the above mentioned.  Worth the money in exchange for the feelings of euphoria you'll get when those steam cannons, lights, glitz and glam start hitting you from all directions.  \n\nIf on the other hand, you do not have deep pockets and still want to see that huge EDM dj at Marquee, get there early and stake your space on the dance floor.  But be prepared to camp there because if you leave that space to get a drink, you're not getting back.  \n\nTo be clear, I'm not upset with the experience because it did demonstrate the superiority of XS and solidifying the decision to stay at the Encore moving forward. \n\nMy final thoughts:\nGUYS - Shell out the extra $$$ and get yourself a table by the floor, you will have a great time for sure.    \n\nLadies - Get yourselves to a table"
4,"Tasty food, best hummus ever, great service, modern deco (but a bit loud of an atmosphere) and great value! \n\nHubby and I ordered:\nSteak and hummus trio (u can pick any three off the menu) - I really like the plain hummus (had a yummy smokey flavor) and roasted bell pepper. \nKafta pizza - thin crust and generous w the meat topping\nShawarma pita - most popularly ordered item. Juicy chicken breast!\n\nBill came out to $28 and we had leftovers due to the large portions!"
4,"I visited Tunnel Espresso Bar as part of my quest to complete the Montreal Indie Coffee Passport. Having tried out their delicious coffee, I really can't wait to go back! This coffee at Tunnel is awesome - an unforgettably rich and flavourful taste. The coffee beans are also responsibly sourced (roasted in Canada, I believe).\n\nAs far as I know, the only person who works there is the owner, Rob. He's tremendously knowledgable about coffee, and a fantastic person to have a conversation with.  \n\nThere doesn't seem to be fixed hours of operation. They are typically open in the morning on weekdays."
1,"This was my first visit here. Having heard about it, I had wanted to try the place out for some time now. Here's the scenario:\n\nWe arrived at the parking garage and stopped at the parking attendant booth, where we had to pay the $5.00 parking fee (refundable in full if validated in the hotel). Went inside the hotel and found Island Sushi & Hawaiian Grill. I noted their sign at the entrance of the restaurant informed potential customers that an 18% gratuity would automatically be added to the bill for a party of 6 or more. I thought that \""six\"" was quite a small party for an 18% gratuity, but oh well. Luckily for us, we were a party of two.\n\nI ordered the Hawaiian Breakfast which came with a scoop of sticky rice (this was very good), Hawaiian sweet bread (just OK), kalua pig (dry, hard, and needed salt), 2 eggs (I ordered \""easy over\""), and lomi tomato (never heard of lomi tomato, so I asked our waiter about the salmon in the lomi tomato. He confirmed that it's only tomato...no salmon). Hubby ordered fried saimin (which was very tasty).\n\nIn a reasonable amount of time, our orders arrived (pictures posted) and I quickly noticed that my over-easy eggs were much too well done...overly fried. The kalua pig needed salt but it was edible. Some parts of the kalua pig were tender, but mostly the pig was hard and tough. You need to have strong jaws to finish all the pork on your plate! The lomi tomato was good, considering there was no salmon in this dish. Sticky rice very good. I tried my best to eat the rubbery eggs but I had to ask for another set of over-easy eggs. When the 2nd set of eggs came, it was barely different from the first set. The 2nd set of eggs were again equally burned on the bottom, but at least now the yolks were soft and liquidy. I guess their chef only knows how to cremate eggs instead of gently frying them under low heat. Amazing.\n\nOh and by the way, I didn't know it but if you Check In with Yelp while you're at the restaurant, they will give you a 15% discount. No one told me about this discount. I was pleasantly surprised when I did a Check-In on Yelp while waiting for our food to arrive.\n\nAfter our meal we did go over to the Cashier and got our $5.00 parking fee refunded.\n\nOK so I've been here, done that.\n\nP.S. - Our bill amounted to $17.36 which included the 15% discount from Yelp. I gave them a $20.00 bill and another food server came back with my change of $17.00. Quite astonishing, when I expected to receive $2.00 and some change. I called her over to our table and explained the erroneous change I received. She went back to the cashier, this time returning with the correct change, and she thanked me."
1,The food is just ok. Veggies didn't seem fresh and the taste was just weird. Probably would not go back. It didn't help to see staff in Packers gear. Go Bears!
3,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, nice walk in humidor, comfy overstuffed chairs.  Place was nice and quiet, sat and read a book. Without interruption."
3,"This is a great facility with a friendly staff. I come here to see Dr. Schoenhaus currently and like her a lot. She seems to be very caring and always addresses any concerns I have and will keep asking me if I have any other questions or concerns. She doesn't just come in with the laptop and stare at it. She sits down and has a real conversation with me. I've also seen Dr. Edmond Pack here. He's a great doctor too, the only reason I switched to Dr. Schoenhaus was because he has started to have a longer waiting time for scheduling and I had really needed an appointment. The office itself is beautifully decorated with home decor. You feel really comfortable sitting in their lobby to wait for your appointment. Highly recommend!"
2,"I went here with a friend, she had a groupon. Normally it was a little pricey so if I go back it would be for lunch. We got a big portion of food. You start with a ginger broth which was surprisingly quite tasty. Then comes a salad w/ a strong ginger dressing, but it grew on me, then u get a shrimp appetizer. You get a shrimp sauce which was really good & a ginger sauce which wasn't great. I dipped everything in the shrimp sauce. Then comes the stir fried veggies which were my favorite. Then the noodles, rice (steamed or fried) the steamed was better. And finally the meat of your choice. I had teriyaki chicken, great flavor. Overall I enjoyed the food & the preparation was entertaining to say the least."
0,"We ordered the \""California Vegetarian Burrito w/ enchilada sauce.\"" Took two bites and asked for our money back. Seemed like the strategy was to hide the taste of old food with onions.  The enchilada sauce was dark brown and had mystery chunks in it, and tasted burnt. \n\nThree times the price of Taco Bell and half as good."
3,"When it comes to customer service from big business, I go in ready to rip someone's head off.  Just a reflex from years of horrible service from phone companies, insurance companies and the like.  That being said, we had a very complicated task to do over the phone with my mom being in another state and trying to do a 5 person family plan.  I told the girl straight away that I had a difficult project to accomplish.  Our plan has to be set up just so because our employers pay part of our bill.  She said, no problem and started working on the task, also working together with the manager in another state and getting all our new phones ready.  We were in the store nearly 2 hours, but we were patient and pleasurable, as was the other staff smiling and chatting.  A \""weird\"" guy even comes in and annoys the people with his \""phone nerd\"" chat and they were even very nice to him, although he was even annoying me and I wanted him to leave.  I hope that Sprint can keep this up because our Verizon service over the years was horrible.  Too many large companies have a \""you need us, we don't need you\"" attitude.  I am doubtful that Sprint will keep us this first impression for the 15 years we were Verizon customers, but I hope so."
0,"I've been to many mongolian bbq places all over the country but this was not mongolian bbq. It tasted like a poor excuse for a fajita. None of the \""sauces\"" had the right flavor and even the suggested combinations were terrible. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Especially if you have ever had real mongolian bbq. It was a real disappointment."
1,"I've not been crazy about my last few visits to Cabo Fish Taco. The food is still good, but the servers keep getting grouchier and grouchier. The last few times I was there, it wasn't very busy, but our server was inaccessible and grouchy. Boo."
0,"My husband and  I contracted a really bad stomach flu bug, so bad that neither one of us could stop throwing up.\n\nWe went to the Banner Estrella ER at about 1 a.m.  While the wait time wasn't long, I was literally on the verge of passing out and all they did for me was to plunk me in a wheelchair and sit m next to one of the banks of chairs.  There were only 4 other people there, so it did not look overly busy.\n\nThey took us back into a room that only had an examination table and took more information.  The nurse told me we each had a $200 copay.  I told her I left the house without a way to pay.  She kind of huffed at me and said curtly \""Well I am going to note in your file that you did not have the means to pay today\"".  That was the LAST think I was worried about.  I felt like we were both dying.\n\nThey took us back to another type of waiting room, which had about 25 chairs, hooks on the wall, garbage on the floor and used blankets on the chairs.  They hooked us both to IV's and left us sit there, extremely uncomfortable.  Where the heck are the beds, or something to lean back in?  As a person who feels like they are dying from the flu, the last thing I want to do is sit up.  We were given thin blankets to cover ourselves with an puke buckets.\n\nI will not use this ER again.  It's apples and oranges compared to the Mayo ER.  I have never gone to an ER where they didn't give you a place to lay down.  Once again, I have nothing against the staff - it was the way we were treated physically and the garbage laying around this ER treatment room.\n\nKaren"
0,"I figured since the reviews were good that I would be happy. Quite the opposite. Is a simple high fade to much to ask? I guess so, since now I have to shave my head. I guess a high fade means a high and tight jar head style. I wanted to stay inside military regs is what I said. Well, the top is varying in length anywhere from 2 inches to .5 an inch. On top of it all they charge an extra 2 dollars to straight razor you....hmm I'm pretty sure everywhere else that's included. A waste of $18  How hard is it to find a decent barber in this town?!"
3,I am torn between this place but the review is for bottle service only. Came a few weeks back and saw Danny Avila and a group of us got a bottle. First off Danny tore that set up. Second besides Light which is my favorite club in Vegas the table service was premier here. I had table service at all the major clubs now in Vegas which promote EDM and this club is it. Both XS and surrender are cool but they rush you and kick you out. IMO Hakkasan not only have great hosts but the layout for table only is top notch. I will definitely come back for table ONLY as all the other reviews have mentioned the place gets packed and I wouldn't want to be out in the crowd without a table.
2,"Hey guess what cowboy? This is a huge concert venue, why are you reading reviews?  You know that even at their best they are always middle of the road, and you don't have an option.\n\nPro:  They get major acts to perform on a regular basis, the staff is generally not a bunch of jerks, and while Pavilion Rd. is a testament to poor city planning traffic is not #SMDHV horrible, just #SMH horrible.  Parking is \""free,\"" so that's what goes into all those ticketmaster fees, thanks corporate America!\n\nCon:  $11.00 is not an appropriate price for a deuce-deuce of Coors Light.  Food is not horrible unless you get a \""fresh\"" hot pretzel, welcome to crown-ville - population: cracked tooth.  Tickets are not cheap, and by not cheap I generally mean expensive for seats middle of the road for lawn.  As with any public place, lavatorial facilities are quick to be disgusting.  For me, the University area is the middle of friggin nowhere, and it is not too convenient to get to and fro.\n\nBut like I said, you don't have a choice.  So there is really no debating it. Bring beers, keep an ice cold cooler by your car and \""pre-game.\""  That's the only suggestion I have for ya."
4,"Went in yesterday to pick up some meat for dinner. Decided to do burgers after seeing the \""gourmet steak\"" ground mixture they had. Ron said it was a mixture of the ends of different quality cuts & a basic BBQ seasoning they use in the store. Well, they sure didn't let me down with this one! To make a quality burger, it's all about the meat & bun. I took these home to grill up \""New Mexico\"" style, in light of all the great peppers out right now. Added a queso sauce, arugula, roasted poblano peppers, pickled red onions, and blue corn tortilla chips on a toasted brioche bun - cooked medium, of course! Everyone was impressed. Well done, Ron & team!"
1,"Only because I know the food is good that I give it 2 stars, but otherwise the service is absolutely horrendous.  I won't be coming back, cause the food isn't good enough to excuse the poor service"
2,"dear wildflower,\n\nokay, i forgive you.  we can be friends again.  now that i KNOW that you can get a half sandwich & soup, i did...and it was pretty tasty.  garlic tomato soup and the chicken salad...nothing amazing, but decent.  the reason you get another star was the service this time.  dude behind the counter was awesome, you should give him a raise, wildflower!  he got me samples of the soup and was super patient waiting for me to puzzle thru my complicated monkey mind to decide what sounded good.  a word of advice, you should put more salads on your menu for the \""wildflower two\"" option.  three salads is not enuf to pick from, ESPECIALLY when one is a caesar!  anyway, like i said, i forgive you.  but, srsly, don't call or text every day...we aren't that kind of friend.  if i see you, i see you.  and, srsly, don't piss me off again...i don't want to have to egg you.\n\nbisdan,\nally"
3,"If you are craving a burger...you can't top this in Vegas. OPTIONS OPTIONS OPTIONS!!! You start by selecting your meat...generous options. Then your bun type and then almost half a page of toppings. Including something like 9 types of bacon, different types of onions...all the way up to lobster. Cheap sides too...all delicious. A MUST!"
2,"MGM Grand. The hotel with all the big boxing matches and the lion \""habitat\"". It was the first time I stayed here and we found it for a pretty reasonable price. \n\nA big heads up when parking in their structure is to remember exactly where you parked. It could get kind of confusing and you may get lost. Checking in was really quick and rooms are pretty spacious. One of the biggest downers was that when we made room reservations online the website said we would have free buffet tickets. When my husband went to check in the girl at the front desk said she had no indication of that special on the system. She stated that if there was something on the confirmation email or if we have proof she could give it to us. I was totally bummed even though my husband screenshot it on his ipad from the website we didn't decide to pursue it. We kind of forgot about it. Still a big let down though.\n\nThe room was pretty spacious but the television was a little dated. One of the big things I look for in a hotel room is a flat screen and this television was a little old school. The room was fairly clean minus the pillow with \""stains\"" on it. Yes, I know. I have watched all those little news specials about how disgustingly dirty 5 star hotel rooms are and how many stains are on the walls and comforters using a blacklight. The only thing is I didn't have a blacklight and the stains were just there. Mind you it was only the decoration pillow but it was pressed up against the pillows we were supposed to sleep on. I threw it on the side of the room and opted to not have the room service clean so they don't put it back on the bed. Aside from that the bed was amazing and I had the best sleep there on my vacation.\n\nThe hotel is location is pretty good too especially if you are driving since its more toward the beginning of the strip. There's lots of restaurants and lounges in the hotel that you can choose from but the hotel is currently under some renovation. You can also walk next door to New York New York or to the other nearby hotels. Great thing is that it is located at the beginning of the monorail if you want to blow $15 bucks for an all day pass to use the monorail on the strip. Overall good experience for the price."

3,"The service here is great. It's off in the boonies and not at McCarran (2miles north), but we went here cus our initial car had a transmission overheat problem in the middle of the desert despite us driving safely with AC on minimal and in the evening, odd, probably the previous people pushed the car too much (it is a rental). Both this location and the San Jose had really good service. They refunded us a day and gave us a new tank. Everyone is super friendly. I'd give it 5star except we were stuck for 30 mins in the desert letting the car cool down. I do recommend them because of their great service though."
1,"I really want to like this place, really I do. From the funky decor to the fun drinks and the great location, I really want to say I adore the food but I can't :(\n\nI've gone here a few times and everytime I go I'm always disappointed in the food. The chips and salsa are so yummy and addicting but the food isn't really traditional. The last time I went I ordered a mojito which was really watered down and the nachos which sounded amazing but were sorely lacking when they showed up. For the price you pay you'd expect crisp chips and large juicy chunks of white tender chicken breast. Topped with melted cheese and fresh jalape\u00f1os. The chips were soggy, and the meat was dark meat and fatty. The jalape\u00f1os were soggy and canned. So disappointing. I'll be back for drinks but not for food."

0,"I was a Honey Bears fan for 20 years.  No more.  Will never visit again.\n\nStopped off at the Central Ave. location after a Sunday D'bax game.  Not that crowded.  Ordered, paid, and waited.  And waited.  Noticed most other customers were waiting too.  They finally brought out an order - #131 - I had #143.  Another 10 minutes before #132 came out.  People started coming up to the counter wondering what was going on.  The cashier was dismissive - no explanation, no apology, nothing.\n\n50 (50!) minutes later my order finally arrived.  I didn't bother to complain knowing YELP is my best revenge.\n\nMaybe there was a managment change, but Honey Bears will never see me again."
0,"Is there a way to give negative stars?  We chose this place because it seemed like a nice quiet place to chill and talk.  At first, that's exactly what we got.  Our server was pleasant and quick with the drinks.  She left about 15 minutes after we sat down, however, and things turned awful.\n\nWe were harassed by 3 different homeless people for money.  Granted, it's not Fitzgerald's fault that homeless people come up to people sitting on their patio. However, they didn't take an active role in getting the homeless people to leave until one actually went into the bar.  They care about themselves not being bothered and not the customers sitting on the patio.\n\nAround 1am we were told it was last call and asked by a bartender if we wanted another drink.  By 1:10 our tabs were all closed but we remained on the patio talking and finishing our last call drinks. As with all drinking, we took turns going into the bar to use the restroom.  At 1:30am we were told that we couldn't go in and out of the bar (even to use the restroom).  At 1:45 we were told by a bartender that the bar closes at 1:30 and the sign in the window and google (which both say the bar closes at 2am) haven't been right \""for a long time.\"" The entire time this was going on, the bartenders were sitting inside at the bar with a \""friend\"" watching us. They were rude every time we used the restroom. They were rude about us being on the patio.  They were rude about picking up our glassware from the patio. At 1:55am they apparently got sick of waiting for us to leave and we watched as the bartenders ran up the street with the friend they were sitting at the bar with to make last call at another bar (which they told us they wanted to do earlier in the night).  The staff here do not care about this place or the perception their actions leave with the customers.  I wouldn't go back to this place if they were giving out $100 bills with every beer (which was only slightly above room temperature btw). There are far too many better options uptown to waste your time at a place that does not care about your business."
0,"First of all, it's not a real, \""restaurant\"" it's really a make shift spot with tables located inside Doc Holiday's.  We came to this place after hearing amazing reviews from a magazine, boy were we surprised.  We wanted to order ribs but, \""Sorry, we don't have any.\""  What!?  You are a Barbeque restaurant.  I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and it came out PINK...PINK as in undercooked and totally overpriced.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Then to top things off they brought us beer that was frozen solid.  If I wanted a Slurpee I'd go to 7/11.  Do NOT eat here."
1,The food is still great but the hostess rude. Poor customer service for the hostesses. Good servers. Food came out quick. Tastes great. Too bad the hostess put me off right from the start.
4,This place is amazing.  The selection is excellent.  This place is second only to Hi Times Wine Cellar in Costa Mesa California.  They have a great craft beer and wine selection.  They also have free wine tasting going most of the afternoon Friday through Sunday.  When I went they had some free tasting for some flavored vodkas as well.
1,"No offense but I came with a bachelorette party of 8 for some fine dining. And yes while we got good food, it wasn't worth the almost $600 tab, especially when alcohol wasn't even involved.\n\nWe had to share:\n- Fruiti di Mare Spaghetti ($31) - your basic sea food red sauce pasta. nice inclusions were the lobster bites.\n- PAPPARDELLE with 'porcini trifolati' ($22 for the \""appetizer portion\"", $37 for the dinner portion) - this was good but i've had just as good for less than the appetizer price.\n\nHere's the doosie:\n-Bone in Ribeye for 2 - WATCH OUT FOR THE PRICE - they list it as $72 but it is really $72 x 2 = $144 for ONE large ribeye steak\n- Porterhouse for 2 - again same tricky pricing wording - they list as $80 but it is really $80 x 2 = $160 for ONE large porterhouse.\n\nI'll be honest, I've had ribeye and porterhouse steaks and they tasted as good but NO steak should cost $160 unless it is encased in gold. Seriously, this was ridiculous\n\nI don't even want to bother telling you about the sides and dessert we ordered because in the end, the outrageousness of the steak prices boggles my mind.\n\nthe food and service were fine. but i'm telling everyone now, save your money and go somewhere else. you can get just as good at any other place and still have money to go gamble."
0,Worst Dairy Queen. They didn't know what butter pecan ice cream was. They also refused to sell a blizzard in a waffle cone like they advertise on TV. Long wait at the drive thru.
0,"Mrs. Paul's...look out!  This place is disgusting!  I couldn't even taste the fish...and then again maybe that was fortunate.  The Trout Almondine that was said to be fresh had large pieces of almonds, lots of breading and soaked in butter.  There were carrots and green beans on the side similar to the ones you get in a frozen dinner.  The Dover sole was so breaded it should have been called \""chicken fried sole\""...we could barely choke it down.  What we did manage to swallow left us feeling sick and nautious.  It was almost what you would expect from a hospital cafeteria!  It was mostly people 70 plus...do people lose their taste buds when they get older?!?  We saw several people with really tacky toupes too!  This place isn't inexpensive...I just don't get it!  I can only say don't waste your calories, time or money all that you can never get back:)"
1,"Being from Oklahoma I crave BBQ. It's one of my favorite things, yet I Have found it really hard to find good BBQ in Phoenix. When I heard about Tom thumbs market I was excited to try it hoping that my passion for pork would be met. Sadly, I had a bad experience with the food. My brisket was so dry that it was turning grey.....\n\nI had some pulled pork as well and it was not quite as dry as the brisket but still not juicy or smokey and lacked flavor. The sauces were good, really enjoyed the Carolina sauce and they had a real good chocolate chip cookie. When it came to the sides I would recommend the cole slaw. It was a lighter vinegar based slaw with lots of flavor. \n\nWith all the positive reviews and from what I heard from other friends it seems as though I maybe was there on a bad day. Maybe I will try again some other time down the road but for now I just couldn't recommend this place to anyone"
3,"My boyfriend and I went here for happy hour tonight, which is one of the best deals in Charlotte. All apps (even sushi bar apps) are 1/2 off, and Sapporo is $3. \n\nThe space is sexy but not intimate. However, it was early so the tall windows made it quite bright.  \n\nWe sat at the bar, and the bartender was very friendly. One star off because it took her a long time to make my drink, and she poured it out twice while making it. She eventually called over the manager. It was good once I got it though. \n\nWe ordered the shrimp appetizer, which is assorted nigiri. It was pretty good. We got the rock shrimp which was fried lightly with a spicy sauce. It was awesome. We also got the tuna pizza and crispy duck roll. The duck roll was wrapped in a rice wrapper and chilled. It was unexpected, but very good. \n\nOverall, we will definitely return. The sushi was fresh and beautiful, plus we want to try the hibachi grill."
2,Only one thing to say: Lemoncello cream torte.  \n\nMy sole reason for entering the restaurant.
0,"Convenience brought us to this buffet, two weeks ago on vacation.   Let's just say from this point on I'm going to call it \""THE BUFFET THAT TIME FORGOT.\""  \n\nSure, it looked like nice food ... but it was completely tasteless.  Seriously!  Devoid of any flavor whatsoever!  It's a sad thing when you pay $17 and the most flavorful thing you experience is the bowl full of watermelon chunks.  \n\nI remember a time, many years ago, when the Luxor was a pretty decent buffet for the price.  Those days are gone.  Spend a few extra dollars are go somewhere else."
2,"My first visit to Blanco was one that I will remember for awhile. I'll begin by saying that the food was good. I had the machaca beef tacos and a margarita. The beef was very flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick to it, and the margarita (I had the frozen variety) was decent too. That being said, it was rather pricey ($11) for two tacos, rice and beans. I've had better for a LOT less.\n\nNow, I must shift my review from food to the atmosphere. I've got a story to tell, but please note that this story in no way reflects the quality of the restaurant or my feelings about returning. I just want to share the hilarity of my evening and to give you an entertaining reason to visit Blanco.\n\nWe all have preconceived notions about Scottsdale. I tend to stereotype the people that live and play in this part of town as snobby, snotty, stuck-up, and whatever other \""s\"" word you can think of. Of course not everyone that lives or frequents Scottsdale is like that. However, the night my friend and I visited Blanco, that stereotypical Scottsdale crowd was in full effect. \n\nI'm not sure if Blanco has a dress code for women, but it seemed like this Saturday night it was a requirement to wear as short a skirt or dress as possible, along with crazy high heels.  Oh, and it appeared there was a height and weight limit too -- nothing over 100 but taller than 6'. Maybe there was a model convention in town or something.\n\nI have nothing against looking hot. In fact, I think I hold my own. I just was amazed at the amount of skin that was exposed in one restaurant. Being from the rather less cool NoPho area(and even less cool because I used that dumb abbreviation), I guess I didn't get the memo that this was the required look now.\n\nThe eye candy was entertaining to say the least, but I digress.  There was even more fun-filled antics to come. My friend and I were seated next to the bar and about 1/3 of the way into our meal, three 40-something guys were seated behind us.  They were drunk and annoying. I had my back to them, but my ears were tuning in to their conversation, and I heard comments like, \""Oh, she's a six.\"" \""Yeah, for sure, a six.\"" \""Oh, does she have a snaggletooth?\"" Then there were the expletives,  the redundant \""dudes\"" and the constant references to going to Vegas. Oh, and did I mention that my friend, who was facing them, was in full view of their overtly ogling of every miniskirt, tight-jean wearing chick that walked past them. \n\nBut that wasn't all. No, the \""dudes\"" weren't quite happy enough with their caveman-like behavior. After they finished their meal, the middle guy I like to call King Douche asked the bartender if he could have the chef come out. Oh, boy, I thought, this is going to be good. Out comes the chef, who seemed nervous and annoyed at the same time.  King Douche began to rave about the food in an inebriated and slightly incoherent rant. Although I couldn't hear everything King Douche was saying, I think he said something about the food being really good.... but... then went on to criticize almost everything he ate, telling the chef something about having too much of this ingredient here and not enough here, and that he has been a restaurant manager, and it's important to hear the good with the bad, and on an on.  The poor chef stood there kind of dumbstruck.  I honestly don't think he knew how to respond.  He kindly thanked them for eating there and suggested they come back again. \n\nI'm so glad that I wasn't facing these schmucks because I wouldn't have been able to keep from expressing my disgust and amusement. Instead, I just laughed with my friend while cursing their insipid behavior.  In the end, and despite all the young wannabe glamor girls and midlife crisis greasy creeps, it was a memorable dinner at Blanco.  I will likely give the place another try. But next time I'll come prepared to watch the antics with a little popcorn and candy."
2,Al's now has a $20 for $10 coupon on local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  A good deal that makes it worth checking out.
1,"Popped in here with Michelle B for a post-jog brunch last Sunday.  It's a lovely little space and has some fab art work and jewellery and knick-nacks for sale.  Great mixture of seating and tables and a proper turntable and old fashioned vinyl playing in the background. They even encourage you to bring along your own vinyl to play while you're in too, which is a cool idea.\n\nAll looked and seemed promising enough but the food was not good.  I had a bacon roll, made with streaky bacon that was so crispy it fractured into hundreds of tiny pieces when I bit into it.  Also the roll was not fresh and they'd tried toasting it to make it better. It just crumbled too.  Very disappointing.  Lashings of red sauce did nothing to improve the texture or flavour.\n\nMichelle opted for a fruit scone. It looked nice but wasn't fresh either.  In fact, she said it was soo hard that i she \""sconed\"" me with it, she'd need to take me to A&E.\n\nWe did tell the chap who served us, in order to give him an opportunity to rectify matters but he just shrugged it off and presented us with the bill.  \n\nThe only redeeming feature was the pot of tea.  It was lovely. But it's hard to ruin a pot of tea so I'm not sure how much that goes in his favour.\n\nI'd give it another try on another occassion. I'm not ready to write this place off yet. I'm hoping it was just an off day and the food/service will be better on a future visit.  It's got a great location with a fab view of the beach/sea so I hope it does improve."
0,"Fran's has one of the most ambitious menus in Charlotte. Unfortunately, the execution of the menu is decent at best, extremely subpar at worst.  Yes, they have the famous bacon-wrapped tater tots... but by the time they arrived at our table the tots were cold and the maple glaze has solidified into a gooey mess. As a main, I had the meatballs, which had a good taste, but once again were not hot enough. My friend ordered a salad and opted to get the grilled shrimp. For $5 she got three shrimp, which isn't a bad deal, I guess. But it kicked the cost of the entire salad to $12, and it wasn't worth it at that price.\n\nThe service was OK. Our server was friendly, and while he didn't apologize for the slow service or cold food, one got the feeling that it wasn't his fault and the kitchen was having issues. And this was well after the place opened, when most places have all the issues figured out. I'm guessing that the chef is a control freak who insists on doing everything herself, even though food quality suffers for it."
2,"They have a weird process of getting ppl in, but the place isn't that bad. Reminds me of just any typical Hollywood club, the sound system bangs pretty hard +1. Interesting acrobatics on the dance floor, pregame beforehand or your wallet will come out a lot lighter...."
3,"I've heard great things about the Frozen Hot Chocolate here but, every time I'm in Vegas, I never have a chance to try it. Luckily, I finally got to try it on my last trip.\n\nWhat We Ordered:\n- Frozen Hot Chocolate with no whip cream\n- Ahi Tuna Salad\n- Wagyu Beef Sliders\n- Chili\n- Sweet Potato Fries\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate lives up to the hype!!! It was soooo good!!! It was not overly sweet. I was in heaven! The Ahi Tuna Salad was fresh and tasty. My friend enjoyed her sliders and Chili! The sweet potato fries were a little on the soggy side so I really didn't enjoy them. :( I will be back though for the frozen hot chocolate!!! :)"
1,"I really hate to do this, but we've given them several chances over the last 4 months or so.  Ping's has changed.  For over 14 years I loved every bit of food we ever ordered. Enough to murmmer \""mmmm\"" out loud as I slurped it up.  Reasonable prices and good amounts of very tasty food.  I thought it was just me, but when we ordered last time, hubby chose to pick up a sandwich from another establishment  while I gave them another try. \n First of all, they have raised the prices on the menu, as businesses must from time to time.  That only made it sting more. \n Without going into individual dishes, one dish had maybe 2/3 of the beef that it used to last year, and the vegetables piled on top had doubled.  Another order seemed old, as if it was the leftovers of the day, reheated again.  It was inedible.  It even looked way different than any other time I'd had it over the last 10 years.  Different color, breaded only halfway, and tough to chew. It seems they have lost their heart for the business.  I did call and let them know about the dish that was inedible and the owner offered me credit on my next order of the same.  Sadly, I don't think we will be back to use it."
2,"Me and my husband came here for lunch on a Saturday. It wasn't moderately busy. The servers kept walking past us without noticing us. It took a little bit for the server to come over to order our drinks. The alcohol was expensive. $10 for a margarita. We both got waters. Husband ordered the Sorrano Dog and it was very good. I ordered the Carn\u00e9 Asada burrito for $12.95. It only came with lettuce and a small amount of pico de gallo. Additional add ons were extra for the burrito. Burrito contained dry steak, black beans, cheese, and rice mixed with bean mixture. The filling was very dry and not very good to me. I had to eat some of my husband's fries. We also had the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were all broken up into small pieces, like the bottom of the bag chips. The salsa was good. I had to pour it over my burrito to make it taste better."
1,"Unfortunately, Chapala's was closed the day after Thanksgiving, so we ended up here as a plan B.\n\n5 stars for the $4.95 grande margarita during happy hour, which was also honored in the dining room!!! That's the one and only redeeming quality about this place.\n\nChips and salsa: Standard, slightly greasy chips. Tomato based salsa with not much flavor or heat.\n\nDinner: Ordered the #29 combination (taco, enchilada, rice and beans with a green salad.) \n\nGreen salad: Not saying much, but best part of the meal. How can you really mess up lettuce, cheese and ranch dressing?\n\nCheese enchilada: Overcooked tough and crispy tortilla. Enchilada sauce was bland\n\nShredded beef taco: As Clara Peller would say, \""Where's the BEEF?\""  Not much to this taco at all and what little meat was in there, was the consistency of baby food.\n\nRice:  Dry and flavorless\n\nBeans: Impossible to review, since there were only two teaspoons at most on the plate.\n\nValue for the money: Non-existent. $13 for the combo and I left hungry.\n\nThe only reason I would come back here is for happy hour, then hit a Roberto's Taco Shop or Dimas Tacos afterwards!"
1,"We stayed here because we didnt find any other affordable hotel with rooms available.We checked in at 3pm for 2 nights....Total $190 dlls with Tax.The room was clean but too small.The good things, it had a small fridge and a microwave.They actually offer free internet connection.Also they provide free continental breakfast every morning at 7 am,too early for me, but nothing too big. \nSome Cereals,Muffins,waffles,Coffee and Orange juice.\n\nThe bad things.....I had a problem with the shower,suddenly all the bathroom tub was leaking water and it was water all over the bathroom.Called the front desk but \nnobody showed up to clean the bathroom.We had to put some towels but they were not enough.\n\nIts way too far from the strip!!! They do have a free shuttle to Planet Hollywood,but only during day time. We spent like $200 dlls in Taxi Only!! \n\nOverall,for $80 dlls per night,its completely not worth it.You spend more money in cabs or taxis coming and going to the Strip where everything its happening.\nI'd better stay at Circus Circus than at this place. I would never come back and would not recommend to anyone."
3,"Lotus sits in a ghetto Korean plaza away from the Strip.\nAnd so I was a bit concerned until I saw the line of customers forming by the door before the restaurant even opened.\n\nThe interior is much larger than you'd expect and much nicer than you would hope.\n\nThe restaurant runs like a well oiled machine. Customers are seated quickly and orders are completed quickly in what I'd imagine to be a gigantic kitchen. Staff is also attentive and prompt.\n\nI suggest \nPad Thai - good\n#58 - don't remember what it was, just eat it with the lettuce it sits on\nPapaya Salad - fresh and strong\n\nI ordered the crispy garlic prawn as many yelpers suggested and was not impressed..\n\n4 stars because of high prices and below average quantity; will still return."
4,"this place is awesome! was in charlotte for a conference and ended up going back to this place several times. dandelion market has great food and is fun place to go if you want to try a bunch of GREAT food.\n\non our last night in charlotte, we showed up on a sunday night eight people in our group. with no available tables downtown stairs, the staff happily opened up the top floor for us which felt like a private party. the atmosphere here is adorable and i will forever recommend 'the dando' to anyone visiting charlotte."

3,My husband & I came here for our 24th Anniversary. We had a great time. Great attentive service. Food was wonderful & just what we had hoped for. The ambiance was quiet and comfortable. The chairs were thick fabric high end chairs. There are also couches if you want to lounge & eat!. We had the Moscato which is our favorite.
1,If you are with a large group of say 50 you might like this place!  Very casual seating on benches at picnic tables.  Friendly people but food is only fair at best.  Steak was tasteless and appetizers were straight out of the freezer section of the grocery.  If you are looking to eat a half a cow you could order the 32 ounce hunk of beef but if you want taste go elsewhere!

This place is something special. \n\nThe service was amazing! My glass of water was never empty for more than 1 minute. The server was very informative and helpful. He really knew his cows. \n\nFinally decided on Filet mignon, medium rare. BEST. I Have EVER had. Morton Steakhouse has nothing on this mother Spaceship of a Steakhouse... \n\nI always thought people sounded so stupid when they said meat melted like butter in my mouth until this filet mignon melted in my mouth, LITERALLY like butter. Okay. You get my point. \n\nWHAT THE BUCK ARE YOU WAITING FOR! GOGOO!!! Good luck foodies :) muah xo \n\nPS THE MASH POTATOES ......... #idiedofhappiness"
4,"By far my favorite Cirque du Soleil show! The talent in this show is impeccable and the costumes make this show stunning! My favorite acts involve the acrobatics, but I don't want to give anything away. The storyline has to do with bringing back the circus from a place that was lost. I definitely recommend this show to everyone!"
3,"Located inside the Paris Hotel.  Lovely ambiance, great service and awesome food.  \n\nLove their French toast with blueberry sauce and fresh blueberries even though the first time was so much more amazing than the second time.  They unfortunately cooked it way too much and it was quite burned the second time around but I was so hungry I didn't send it back.  :(. \n\nTheir prime steak sandwich is actually super tasty. The slices of meat are very tender and juicy.  Love their dipping sauce.  My mouth is watering as I am talking about it. Also their chicken Brie sandwich is very yummy.  Good portions too so you could share.  \n\nUnfortunately haven't had a chance to sit and dine outside with the lovely views of the Bellagio fountain because the few times I went were extremely hot outside but I will once it starts to cool down.  \n\nThey have such amazing bread & it's complimentary.  Be sure to have some but control yourself from eating the whole batch so you will have room for your meal.  ;)\n\nVery enjoyable experience!!!"
4,"When my A/C suddenly stopped working (as the temperatures were consistently hitting 100 degrees daily) I started panicking and called around to friends and family for recommendations.  My daughter located Cool Touch on Yelp and said the reviews were great.  After using them I can understand why.  Brannen came out on Saturday to take a look at my unit.  Unfortunately my A/C unit had died and the whole thing had to be replaced, this was not completely unexpected due to its age.  I told Brandon I would have to think it over.  Despite not committing to using his company he installed an A/C window unit in my bedroom so my pets and I would not suffer in the heat.  I called him on Sunday and they said they could come out the next day to replace the unit despite the fact that they had to schedule a crane to lift the A/C unit off my roof.\nBy Monday afternoon I was enjoying A/C throughout my house!  They couldn't have been more courteous, professional and helpful.  I cannot recommend them highly enough!"
1,"So i went back recently with a friend of mine on a not so busy night, which was fine by us considering we just wanted a place to have a good drink and hang out.  However something about Crown Room has changed and as we were both such big fans before, we were a bit disappointed...The White Cosmo's i raved about before are still just as tasty and delicious except now when they give you the shaker full of an extra martini, it's just the leftovers of your first one...a bit disappointing considering how much they charge for them.  Also, the staff was super unfriendly when we were there, and for not having very many patrons that night we expected a bit more courtesy.  I'm hoping it was just a mishap that night-however i've been told it's under new management, so i'm not too sure.\nHope you all have better luck than i do lately!"
0,"I REALLY wanted to love this place...but it did not go well.  I never noticed this restaurant although it is right next door to my favorite burrito spot (Super Burrito).  When I arrived they were plenty of people pulling into the drive thru.  Since I couldn't figure out what to order, I went inside.  The staff was cordial.  I decided to keep it simple and ordered a traditional burrito.  I was so excited!  I got home and bit into it and \""crunch\""!  I tried again..more crunch!  Broken egg shells in my burrito!   Needless to say I lost my appetite.  I called to let them know I was bringing the burrito back and no I didn't want anything else (they offered).  Although they were very apologetic, I'm just not sure I can bring myself back to trying something else.  D'lish was a D'isappointment :(  Maybe I'll give the new Tempe location a try *sigh*."
0,"I hadn't been to Las Vegas for 4 years so I took the first taxi from the airport. Yello-Checker-Star.   Big mistake!!!  He asked me which way I wanted to go to the Rio.  I said shortest, cheapest route.  He took the freeway.  The fare was $29.10 and when I gave him 2 $20's he asked if I wanted change!!  When I took a taxi from the Rio to the airport the next morning the fare was $16.20...  I will NEVER get in one of their cabs again and I am telling all of my friends (who fly a LOT) about my experience.  You may make more on the fare one time but it costs you in the end.  Bad way to do business."
4,"Let me start by saying that I have been to a lot of nail salons in my area and this one is by far the best. I love it there. They always take their time with my nails and make sure that they look perfect. And the staff is great. They are professional and have the best prices. They charge me $20 for a full set of acrylics, which is crazy because they do a better job than the places that charge way more. I always have Peter do my acrylics because he is a perfectionist and makes sure that all the nails look even. They are always open minded about my crazy nail ideas and are patient with my hour long color selection. :)\n\nThey do take a long time to do your nails though so if your going there make sure that you have an open schedule. \n\nI always recommend this place to my friends because these are the best nails for your buck and some of the best costumer service I have ever seen. :)"

0,By far worst hotel I've ever stayed at .... front desk lady cristina is rude unprofessional and not knowledgeable at all!!!!
3,"Pretty standard Chinese food.!!   Had the hot and sour soup as an appetizer, followed by \""double pleasure\"" shrimp and scallops... Yum.!   Kiddo had wonton soup & enjoyed it-  I would be excited to have this in my 'hood..."
0,"Totally disappointed. Having spending couple days in Vegas with buffet. I urged my Bf to eat this Chinese food. BUT!! the food is not tasty at all, not to say its \""real traditional Hunan style\"". we ordered three dishes but we didnot finish 1/4(we both were starving).Never come again."
4,Best pizza and pasta in middleton west side of Madison extremely great service everytime the pizza or past is made of  great fresh ingredients convenient reasonable fresh good food good service prompt there is nothing better than novanta take out alcohol and good love ur shit
3,"Split a build-a-burger, waffle fries and had a couple of beers at this a la carte sports burger bar with my hubby after a loooong walk down the strip.  Burger was really good and totally hit the spot.  Liked the sport question at seating with a chance to get 10% off (we failed! It was Drew Bledsoe - who knew?).  A bit pricey for what we had, but I'd eat here again."
3,Always find something here....yup I have good luck here
3,"Apparently, the staff is friendly. This wasn't my experience while I dined there but perhaps they were having on off day. If you want to drink water and don't want to waste money on bottles, you will be disappointed to learn that the restaurant apparently doesn't have any filtered water to serve you. I chose to drink nothing in protest.\nAlthough I was irritated early on by the quality of service, the food was another story altogether.\n\nFor the price, the portion sizes were more than adequate to stuff me and my friend full of delicious kabob. I'm an ethnic Pakistani, so I know good kabobs when I taste them, and this place definitely offers the real thing. The meat was juicy and not overcooked, and the spices were certainly adequate. The rice was also authentically prepared meatless pulao-- much more flavorful than the white rice you usually get from restaurants. The naan (white bread) was tasty, but I doubt they bake it themselves (maybe they do, maybe they don't). \nThe wait time was reasonable considering the quality of the food. \nThe restaurant is certified \""halal\"" (which is basically \""kosher\"" for muslims) if you care about that sort of thing.\n\nIf you're a Vegas local who hangs out in Fremont, you owe it to yourself to try this place."
3,Good atmosphere for a neighborhood location. Menu items had a great selection of salads - sliders were great!\nWill be back!
0,This is the slowest serving panda express I have ever been to. Four different visits here and every time it took more then 20 minutes to get through the drive thru. VERY slow.
2,"No Malibu Rum served here... Yep, the imposter again! No worries because Malibu Rum Barbie enjoys sparkling sake. With names like Poochie Poochie and Sawa, I still get something sweet to drink with a fun name :) The two sparkling flavors are $18-$32 and are the equivalent of a glass of wine alcohol and volume size. A bit pricey! \n\nHappy hour prices are quite reasonable although you'll be tempted to order a bunch of different items and end up spending a fortune!!\n\nA good place to come for ambiance and conversation. The staff and decor are both pleasant and easy on the eyes."
4,"This bar is my default whenever I'm looking for something to do on any night of the week. \n\nThe friendliest crowd in a bar in southside, the best bartenders in the southside, the most eclectic and highest quality of DJs and music from every genre imagineable. \n\nPrices are high, but drinks are strong and well made. Decor is very funky. Space is very intimate. Highly recommended if you like House, Trip Hop, Underground Hip Hop, 80s, Soul......anything like that. What you won't find: Top 40. That's a great thing, and something that's increasingly hard to find in the south side anymore."
2,"CVS is fairly close to my house. I like to stop here and get birthday cards, etc anytime I'm in a rush.  Anyhow, there's a reason why I always get my prescription filled at Walgreens and not CVS. My fianc\u00e9 is sick so I decided to get some meds for him. I went up to the pharmacist to ask what would she recommend and she was just rude. I felt that she was annoyed that I was even there asking her a question. I just wanted to know if she recommends anything else for his sore throat/coughing. Not being helpful, I ended up walking out with just dayquil/nyquil. I'll be back, but not to ask the pharmacist anything."
0,"The service here was downright awful. My girlfriend and I went in to check out the club around 10:00. The door guy was actually nice and told us the club opened at 11 and we could have a drink in the restaurant area until then. So we sat down and a waitress brought us a drink menu. However, she never came back to take our order. We were there for about a half hour before we finally left. She stopped by many times at the tables near us but never came to our table. We eventually left and when we came back to go to the club, we were greeted rudely by the bouncer and told to not even bother since we weren't on the guest list, even though we had a VIP coupon. Zero stars!!!! There are other clubs in Vegas."
0,"Ok, well I didnt go here to play slots or cheap table games. I happened to be nearby and hungry. I started to recall the Yelp reviews about the cheap hot dogs that are available and figured, what the hell. So I go inside and there is the snack area that sells the hot dogs right next to the Subway. Huge line at Subway and nobody at the snack bar. I think \""Hmm, surely these people do not know about these glorious hot dogs. What a pity!\"". Most likely they were looking at me and thinking, \""Look at that idiot standing alone at THAT place. Does he believe EVERYTHING he reads? What a pity!\"". So I order the hot dog and make it the combo. It says you get a hot dog, a bag of chips, and a 20 oz soda for $3.99. I think thats what it cost at least. I'm trying to erase the whole episode from my mind so I may be off a little on the price. The soda you get is actually a lot larger than 20 oz though. Anyways, on to the hot dog. Why did I even take a bite of this mystery meat concoction? First off it was cold. I should of just threw it away and chalked it up to another Vegas gamble that didnt pay off. But no I'm too damn stubborn. Took a bite and almost vomited. Got up to throw it away. Even that was an ordeal. Having to maneuver through a maze of rats with wings...errr pigeons....must be part of the ambience that people seem to like about this place. I will be back to do some gambling I am sure. I WONT be back to do further damage to my intestines though."
2,"Super busy, don't even try to go during lunch and during tuesday night where there is a bruschetta board and bottle of wine offered for $20.00 bucks.  Still a good date place and a good ladies who lunch type of place.  I love the architecture but the people watching is not nearly as good as the original spot in Arcadia.  it lacks the magical first dates and patio lined with mature trees.  this one feels a little more corporate, a little like a place in L.A. which tries to be quaint but is actually owned by a pharacuetial company looking to diversify their portfolio.  the food is still spectacular, amazing things they can do with bread.  Avoid dessert or the coffee.  the dessert is unimaginative and the coffee is horrible, it takes acidic and cold."
1,"The guy behind the counter was a dick. Maybe its the fact im a cute female, so theres no way I could be a actual gamer in his eyes. I bought 2 Call of Duty Black Ops 2 games for PS3 yesterday, he was not nice & he didnt even offer the map pack package like he did everyone else before me. I just appreciate a friendly attitude especially since Ive spent a large amount of $ in that store on Triton Headsets, Bat Man Arkham City, Halo 4 etc etc..."
3,"I had a great meal here today and decided to make it an early birthday lunch since I received an online 2 for 1 coupon.  This location never seems very crowded, and it was a beautiful day on the patio.  Our server was very bubbly and knowledgeable and gave us plenty of time to decide...we were in no rush and their menu is fairly extensive.  They do have a special Octoberfest menu which includes a variety of german entrees including bratwurst, frankfurters, schnitzel etc.\n\nI felt like eating fairly healthy, so I had the blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich (see pics) with the cajun remoulade on the side.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the bun fresh and the garlic fries are amazing, smothered in fresh garlic and parsley!  I only had a few and my partner indulged in the rest.  He had the BBQ chicken pizza which has a nice kick from the Marzen BBQ sauce.   It's definitely a big serving for one person, but he was really hungry.  He started off with the house salad which looked delicious and includes bacon, egg and candied pecans.  I would definitely recommend this place....great food, solid value, excellent service and nice atmosphere."
3,"So, I was about 15 minutes late to my dinner date here (thus, missing happy hour) since its so hard to find.  And then even harder to park.  Then I had to walk a block.  I should have just rode my bike.\n\nThe atmosphere is very typical to other Sam Fox restaurants - loud, open, big pieces, attractive waitstaff, private rooms.\n\nMy party split a number of appetizers and I have to give a special shout out to the soft pretzels with fondu and home made chips with onion dip! Yum! Its dangerous having that many delicious carbs...\n\nThey only have one vegetarian entree - but several appetizers and salads could also appease a meat-free palate.  I ordered the sweet potato tortellini and it was divine! It so rich and buttery that I almost felt like I was eating a dessert - I didn't know that a sweet potato could literally taste so sweet! I'm glad that I split it with another person, because it would have been too rich to tackle on my own. \n\nThe kale salad was mediocre and didn't come with almonds as the menu said - but some other kind of nut.  I much prefer the kale salad at True Food.\n\nAfter splitting 4 or 5 appetizers, and then dinner...there was no room for dessert.  I would come back here during happy hour for some drinks and soft pretzels!"
1,"I love the food here, but the planning and service are atrocious.\n\nFirst off, reservations don't mean what you think they do.  Make a reservation?  Plan to still wait and then get seated at a community table.\n\nSecondly, they have too much going on.  Most of the year appears to feature a limited menu of one kind or another.  If you go there and it's an open menu day, try not to like the food too much, because it may be a year before you can have it again.\n\nFinally, I've had more crappy service there than I've had good.  Servers have forgotten to bring a course, brought the wrong food, not checked back on us - you name it.\n\nIt's sad because the food here really IS good.  It's just so hard to get."
1,"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:\n\nKalbi - These were just ok.  The marinade was nothing special... pretty much what I expected which was overly sweet with not much of a complexity of flavoring agents.  The meat itself was probably the thinnest cut of short ribs I have ever seen.  Even L&L serves up a thicker slab.\n\nKatsu - This was actually pretty good.  Tender and juicy interior with a super crispy and light exterior.  Unfortunately I was not diggin' the dipping sauce.. it just tasted like hoisin mixed with oyster sauce.\n\nChicken Teriyaki - The teriyaki sauce is horrible.  It was thickened with so much cornstarch that it didn't have much flavor.  \n\nAdobo Omelette -  Don't know what everyone is raving about.  Imagine leftover adobo that mom made from the night before, which was fried with some leftover rice the next morning, then wrapped in a blanket of the flattest scrambled eggs I have ever sunken my teeth into.  I mean don't get me wrong, it definitely has that \""homemade\"" and \""comfort food\"" spot we all have, but please do not go out of your way just to make this purchase.\n\nMac Salad - Typical island mac.. peppery, sweet, & mayo-y.\n\nRice - Super sticky to the point where the rice balls on my plate were a congealed mass of mush.\n\nSpam Musubi - Well, you can't mess up spam, but you can mess up the complimenting sauce and well, the sauce that was slathered between the spam and the rice did the spam musubi no justice.\n\nOVERALL:  Not worth another penny from my wallet.  Maybe it would've been better if it were drunk food.  Also, the people that work here weren't very friendly.  Not one person had a smile on their face.\n\nLike I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"
4,"Walked into Harumi for the first time this weekend and was greeted right away! The staff is friendly, welcoming and helpful, and the sushi is pretty good as far as sushi in Arizona goes. This is not your gourmet sushi restaurant; they serve traditional and a few fun rolls in a simple, yet appealing style. Their grab and go sushi also makes for a quick and healthy lunch option for employees in the downtown area! I ordered a lunch bento box with bulkogi beef and they loaded my plate up with fried rice, house salad, veggies and tofu! Not really the type of bento I'm used to but it was a good sized portion and really tasty!"
4,"Due to the convenience of parking right out front, I get takeout from here at least once a week. The new Indian fusion dishes are great. Gobi Manchurian is my personal favorite. Crunchy, spicy, with a sweet-ish sauce and fresh cilantro. It's best either eaten fresh in the restaurant or re-crisped in a 400 degree oven. I also like to get steamed veggies with sauce on the side to take home and doctor according to my preferences for a quick and lighter meal. \n\nThe owners and people working here are so nice. They're happy to do special orders."
3,This vue cinema is located in the omni centre.It offers the latest films to see for an affordable price.There are comfy seats and a good quality screen to watch your film.You can get food drinks and others to get before you go in to see your film.
1,Get your picture taken with the Million Dollars! It's free. Otherwise run while you can... This place is in dire need of a renovation.
4,"Food and service was great. This is second time we have eaten here, both times visit was great."
4,"My favorite Gucci store by far. Was told it was the 2nd-3rd biggest Gucci either in the world or in the US. One of them haha but it is definitely well stocked!\nOur sales associate was Antionette and she was very professional and just so nice, she was easy to get a long with and she made sure we got what we wanted! She wasn't pushy or trying to sell us but rather asked what we wanted and what we liked. \n\nWill definitely be back to visit on our next trip"
3,"Our first experience with the clinic was when our dear family pet had to be put to sleep. It was obviously a very sad time for us, and we found the staff at the clinic to be very sympathetic and they treated the situation with compassion and were careful to advise us on our options, then respect our choices.\n\nA few months ago we adopted a dog from a rescue shelter and took him to Anasazi for his shots and check-up. We were again pleased with our experience with the staff, who offered advice and treated our pet as the adorable pooch he is. I found their prices to be what I've seen elsewhere except for the nail-trim which was a whopping 20 bucks! Next time I'm going to Petco where they'll do it for $7.\n\nOverall we were very pleased with the clinic and will return there next time."
1,"I consider myself a cupcake Connesiour  and have tried out Sprinkles on several occasions and each time leave feeling like I overpaid and have been disappointed by the cupcake.  While the actual cake part may be the most moist cake I have ever had the other things that comprise the actual \""cup\"" part are lacking.  There is a lack of connection between the toppings and cake and the overall taste isn't that great.  It just always leave me wishing I went somewhere else and for $3.50 and up a cupcake, there are lots of choices that one should not be disappointed.\n\nThe parking is ATROCIOUS and the space inside is not for the claustrophobic.  There are usually about 15 people in the space of an elevator, salivating while waiting for the cupcake in a chaotic mess."
2,Food pretty good   Beer not so much
2,"Sambuca is a lovely little Italian restaurant on Edinburghs Causewayside.\n\nSambuca specialises in traditional Italian fish and steak dishes, but with a modern twist - the restaurants namesake drink is poured onto the dish and set alight as your meal is being served - a truely wonderful sight. However, as to be expected, this often leaves an odd aniseed taste, which has only worked with around half of the dishes I have eaten at Sambuca. That said, food is very delicious and well priced.\n\nIf you are willing to ignore the need for a decorater, Sambuca is a nice restaurant to go to for somehting a bit different."
2,"Yup, they have gas. \n\nI've only run inside the convenient store section once and they had the typical sodas, snacks, etc. \n\nPros:\n1) The pumps function\n2) The pumps take credit/debit cards\n3) The location is prime if you're running around the Park Rd/Woodlawn area\n4) Car wash! \n\nCons:\n1) The traffic can be ridiculous near the intersection so it can be a hassle to turn in.\n2) Because of its prime location (and proximity to another gas station across the street), the per gallon price can be inflated."
1,"The good: Ask for a view. The suite was spacious and had good amenities. Valet parking is free.\n\nThe bad: SERVICE. The front desk staff might as well not be there. A computer that spits out your keys would be more helpful than the two college guys who were there when we checked in. \n\nI was going to meet my friend (staying with me) there in the lobby and she didn't have a cell phone (international). She arrived first and gave them my name before sitting in the bar. I then checked in and gave them her name before waiting in the lobby for 25 minutes. After an hour of frantically calling other friends in the area to try to find her, I checked the lobby one last time. Luckily she had moved to the lobby after an hour of waiting in the bar. \n\nYes, we all failed on this one, however at any other crappy hotel, the front desk staff would have written a note when she came in and given it to me with my keys. We told the front desk staff what happened after the fact and got blank stares. This place was not that busy and no one else was waiting in the lobby. Wow. Facebook was way more important to these guys than lifting a finger."
3,"Delicious food, great dining experience.  One of the better in the southwest!\n\nI frequent the many Thai establishments in this area...and there are several.  Of the choices around, I give this place top marks.  Even before I look at the menu, Panna merits high marks for a great dining room and customer service.\n\nThe food is always good and they put a little extra into presentation.  Not that I care much about that at Thai restaurants if the food is good, but it's a nice change.  \n\nThis is a good spot for a business lunch, or if you fancy Thai on a social outing but are looking for a little bit more upscale setting."
0,"I went because I have friends who go here every 3 weeks for basically a nail party and my bestie insisted that I come because you can't beat the price for the work. Now this place is out of the way for me but on the positive experiences from my friend I decided to travel the extra 45 minutes to join their party.  My appointment was at 4, well I sat around for an 45 minutes before I was taken back with the rest of the party that services started at 5. This has me annoyed because of NO communication from the manager to me or from the nail stylist. Which 2 out of the 3 had come to the front desk numerous times while I was sitting there. I actually was happy with the service once I was actually seen. So the bad ending was the price that was given at the end of the service was not the same price given to my friends. I was charged for an extra $10 dollars for nail art which for them is included in a $10 polish change considering I had no polish on at all I think that was ridiculous. My clue was the shocked look on the receptionist face when she heard the pricing and my friend couldn't understand the big difference in the price.  I was surprised that they did not try to fix the situation when my friends are some of their best customers. I am the type of person who will totally talk up a place if the service is amazing, but sorry now I will tell everyone I know that the place is deceptive in pricing. I will look around my area for a place on yelp that offers the same services for prices that do change from person to person."
1,"Wish we had gone to the Chandler location, but our Restaurant.com gift was for the Southern location. Avoid the pizza here unless you really like sweet doughy crust. Be prepared for lemon on just about everything. Doesn't take long for everything to taste like lemon. Good roast on the potatoes but, be prepared for a very strong lemon taste. Although there wasn't hardly anyone in our area, the service seem slow. The flaming feta was thin and needed more heat. The general appearance is outdated, run down and needing a remodel.  You will enjoy the Chandler location much better than this one."
4,Have nothing but good things to say about iTech Customs. Andre is always very helpful and does a great job. Fixed three of our phones already. Would recommend this place for anyone who needs their phone fixed.
2,My wife and I had never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse and just wanted to get out for a nice dinner. I did not realize there would be SO MUCH MEAT. The meat is good and it is a lively atmosphere. Beautiful building. Go for the experience or to heat several pounds of beef.
2,"My girlfriend and I have been to the Craftsteak at MGM Foxwoods a number of times prior to it closing and I would give that location 5 stars. Our experience here wasn't as enjoyable.\n\nWe decided to give it a try Wednesday night. Having looked on opentable the day or so prior, it seemed like there were plenty of times available so I didn't bother making a reservation. When we arrived at 8:15, we were told the soonest we could be seated was 9:30.We decided to look elsewhere to eat. While doing so, out of curiosity I decided to take a peak at my opentable app and was able to book a reservation at 8:45, which caused us some confusion. Why couldn't they have booked this reservation at the hostess desk? We show back up at 8:45, were seated within a minute, and walked by several open tables at the bar which we specificied earlier would have been fine. Kind of left a bad taste in our mouths to start. \n\nEvery time we've gone to Craftsteak at Foxwoods, we'd share the wagyu ribeye and it was easily the best steak I've ever had, every time. Worth every penny of the $100+. We ordered what we assumed was the same waygu ribeye, but it was unmistakably different. It was the leanest ribeye I've ever had, from the Texas Roadhouse to Grill 32 Boston. If I was told it was a sirloin, I'd think yeah this pretty good...for a sirloin.\n\nThe Foxwood's steak was cut to be shared and the marbleization was so extensive the pieces would fall apart as you lifted it, and those smaller pieces would melt in your mouth. A knife was not needed. \n\nI did some research, finding the Craftsteak at Foxwoods menu PDF, even though they closed: http://www.foxwoods.com/uploadedFiles/Pages/Dine/craftsteak_menu.pdf. They were both 14 oz wagyu ribeyes, but the one at Foxwoods specifies the grade (8) and the farm (Sher Ranch, Australia), and was also $134 vs the $105. We were told by the manager they get their meat from the same farm as the other locations. I didn't have these details at the time, but it didn't matter, it was not comparable. The price different is my only objective evidence of these steaks being of different grades and/or from a different ranch.\n\nWhat saved the rating was the service. We voiced our confusion and slight dissatisfaction, and they were more than willing to replace it but we declined. To our surprise, they comped the steak which was shocking considering the price."
4,"My husband and I had dinner here Saturday night to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary. When my husband called to make the reservation he mentioned it was our anniversary. We did not think they would do anything special, but when we arrived at our table the waiter immediately came over to wish us a happy anniversary. It was so nice.\n\nDinner was amazing and the service was too. We were joking with the waiter about how much I love goat cheese (he caught me stealing some off my husband's plate) and brought out extra to go with my entree (delicious gnocchi). At the end of our meal our waiter surprised us with dessert.\n\nIt was a wonderful and memorable experience!"
4,"Love this place!   Great amatmosphere to hang out to have a drink or watch a game.  The food is good too, an extensive menu for a sports bar.  Pretty much something for everyone."
2,"La bouffe est normale.....le service est lente....sauf que la soupe de fruit de mer est g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse.,,.bonne portion!!si je vais retourner??po s\u00fbre....."
1,"Yes I may be picky.  But now I feel like I have to vomit.  A co-worker of mine told me that I had to try this place if I loved bbq.  Well, I am a sucker for ribs, but today I feel like just a sucker.  Horrible service \""I would like to order a carry-out.\"" \""Then move over there\""), horrible homemade Root Beer (I am drinking plain syrup and sugar), and horrible pain that I now have in my stomach.\n\n2 stars are for the Mac n Cheese...which I must say was burnt just right.  (I love burnt Mac n cheese...yum!)"
0,I have been a loyal customer for over 3 years from this place and recently their food sux and their customer service is awful. Not only their prices are outrageous the cashiers don't know how to be polite and are very rude. We are done and they get a big F.
2,"The food here is solid bar food with big portions.  Turkey Devonshire is a Pittsburgh specialty, and the cheese sauce on it is heavenly.\n\nWe had a nice lunch at the bar, the bartender couldn't have been nicer- but I had a major issue with the woman they have as hostess.  She is a younger brunette with a bob and serious lack of social skills and customer service.  She turned people away, had to pry it out of her that you could order food at the bar.  When I asked her if we could see menus as we sat at the bar ( she was 5 ft from me putting menus back into the stack of 50 behind her) she said only the bartender could give them to us.  ( They are the same exact menus FYI). What really put me over the edge is how she stared at this 85 year old woman with a walker who made he way off the street in 85 degree temperature.  I got up to open the door for the woman as the hostess stared blankly at her like what the hell do you want.  This poor lady is getting her walker stuck on the carpet about to trip and the hostess was flat out cold dismissive toward her.  It's really a shame because I love the restaurant, and this particular woman and het attitude do not fit in with the character of the restaurant as a whole."
0,"Ohh yeah, i remember this place. Went there when we just got a house in search of appliances. \nI kinda wondered around the stored, groped some fridges and stoves, fondled some microwaves, played with washer/dryers. Interestingly enough no one was interested weather I am there for a tour or actually going to purchase something. \nI did not find their listed prices to be amazing, and no one bothered to assist me with possibly better prices, so i just left. Screw them!\n\n\""I NO like\"""
4,"Yesterday I went to the brewery with friends and wondered why I had never been there before! The beer was awesome, and the bourbon beer was especially delicious. I went on a tour of the brewery (which is free!) with jimmy and it was great! He was so knowledgable and entertaining, and I was surprised about how much you actually get to see while on the tour. Great spot and I'll definitely be back!"
2,"I LOVE THEIR SIGN!  it stands out in that shopping center. I have been here twice and I have to say I really like the interior.  I especially like wood ceiling and the seating... so many options.  I sat with a group of 14 around the super huge square table and also sat at one of the marble high tables in the bar area as well.  Yeah... music needs some work.  I was thinking about dropping off a CD for the manager  Service needs work, but it is a new restaurant (though I didn't like hearing about how it would take 20 minutes to split a check).  I'll give them a little leniency with a 3 star since they are new.  Now how about the food? The mac & cheese is yummy, chicken enchiladas, and I like the mixture of chips corn and light/crispy flour!  Quesadilla is average.  I asked for sliced jalapeno and got their rendition which is regular canned and then tastes like they are soaked in sweet pickle juice.... didn't care for those.  \n\nI am happy they have a late night menu so we have more late night options in the area."
4,"Great spot for a truly unique hot dog. Don't be afraid to try the bear. The combination of cheese, peanut butter, BBQ sauce, bacon and cracker jacks makes for on tasty dog. Impressive selection of local and regional craft beers to top off your meal. Give it a try."
2,"Here's the thing...you definitely get what you pay for. We stayed there literally overnight so it was a very quick stay. It was a great deal at $60 for the night which included parking and a quick continental breakfast in the am. \n\nThe hotel's interior looks more like a dorm than a hotel. The rooms are....fine. Some of the pillowcases and bedding was questionable but we kept telling ourselves it's just one night. \n\nThe biggest problem was THE SMELL. We were in a non smoking room but this room had a unique funk all it's own. It was not good. Oh and our room had a view of the pool which we realized had no water in it and had two deck chairs turned over just chilling at the bottom of it *shrug*\n\nBut the staff was super friendly and cheerful and they had some great options for their continental breakfast. Plus we scored great parking outside the front entrance. \n\nSo I probably won't go back there again, but like i said, you get what you pay for. ;)"
0,"Made a Saturday night reservation for two. Arrived on time and was seated within 5 min.  Took over 5 min for our server to stop by the table. He  must of had too many tables or something- the  place was only about 60% full of patrons though- plenty of tables around.  Ordered and waited forever for the worst T-bone of my life. Shoe leather, dry, tasteless. The salad was better than the steak.   Ordered medium and got well. \nVery poor service that evening- no water refills, no bread refills. Could not recommend this restaurant at  all. Eat the buffet and save your money."
4,"We had a three hour layover in Phoenix and since we were sick of the typical airport food we had at our previous stops, we looked around for something a little nicer.  We got seated right away and the staff was super friendly.  We both had the sangria and shared some sort of mushroom dinner as well as the pulled pork.  The meals were amazing and I was still in shock that we were eating this well in an airport.  The food came really fast and it was an overall great experience.  If I ever happen to stop in Phoenix again I would for sure go back."
3,"A friend took me here when I was in Phoenix and my first impression was of a Mexican TGI Fridays. It wasn't a bad thing. and since I'm a truck driver ANYTHING but the truckstop fast food would have been good. \n\nWe arrive just as they seat a party of eight, and with no hesitation were greeted by a friendly hostess and taken to a table. The table arrangement was a little cramped for me (but then again I'm just under 6' and a couple tortillas shy of 280) and my buddy is in the same range. After a while it felt cozy enough. \n\nOur waiter, I want to say his name is Ernesto, was quick to present himself and ask if we wanted drinks. Now, I'm a trickdriver and like to play the part, I made  a comment about my Corona with no fruit and take it like a man-straight and he responded with something to the fact that he hasn't quite made it there yet and needed a few more years to season himself to man status. Ok, this guy's got personality I thought. My buddy and I are a bit rambunctious and Ernesto didn't shy away from it. He joined in on our fun. His service was spot-on in my opinion to the point that I mentioned it to my buddy. Ernesto was very attentive to our needs. The beer was half-empty \""another beer?\"" or \""more chips?\"". He even brought all three levels of salsa. \n\nNow on to our food. The menu was simple and efficient, only 4 pages if I remember correctly, and I decided on the chimichangas de Macayo (carnitas). I'm such a sucker for carnitas, I freely admit, but these were top notch. I would go so far as to say better than grandmas back in California. The mol\u00e9 was good, not overpowering, and a great sauce for this plate. The beans and rice were simple and complimenting as they should be. Oh, and the actual chimichanga itself was huge, pushing upwards of 20oz maybe more and my fork was sufficient enough to cut through; no knife needed. The food was also hot all the way through and not just the outer layer. \n\nThe cost was a bit pricey as our bill was $37 and change for two dinners and two beers, but I would say worth the price. The service and food made the 25% tip an easy choice. I'd be happy to goback"
3,"I am not one for hyped-up restaurants, but i had a friend in town that really wanted to go check out everything the Sugar Factory had to offer.  We went around 8pm on Friday night and got sat immediately.  We were greeted by our server Matt right away and he showed us the \""specialty\"" drink menu and then gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted.  The drinks all sounded good but considering my sister and I don't eat sugar, we couldn't have any and they were VERY expensive.  The menu is comparable to the Cheesecake Factory, with all the different choices, so it was hard to decide.  We finally decided on a steak sandwich, which my friend said was awesome.  My sister got the bacon and blue cheese burger, she enjoyed it and I got the open faced tuna sandwich.  Mine was good but very overpriced, $14, for one small scoop of tuna, but whatever, it's a restaurant on the strip, what can you do?!  The service from Matt was GREAT!!  Never pushy, very funny and honest about everything on the menu that we asked about.  The music was loud but other than that our experience was great.  We also didn't try any desserts, because of the whole sugar issue but one day we will! \n   We also were introduced to another server, Jake, because we were saying we saw his name in another Yelp review, he was very nice and funny.  The hostesses seemed kinda of lost and we had 3 different managers come up to \""table touch\"" to make sure everything was OK.  (that was kinda of weird) But it is a new restaurant.  I would go back if I have company in town that wants to go down there and I also recommend it for tourists.  All in all it was a fun night out."
4,"So you walk in and proceed to the counter.  You order the pizza with whatever toppings you so desire.  You get handed your drink cups and a number to put on your table and try and find a seat.  Maybe a 15 to 20 minute wait for your pizza.  Your pizza comes out and...... \""what the hell is this?  Take this back!  My cheese ain't melted and the pepperoni ain't cooked!\""  Chill my man.....take a few deep breaths....it'll be ok.....just TASTE it......there ya go.....holy cheese right?!  What a blend....It's all over the place and people actually order extra!  That sauce, nice.....sweet and chunky....yummy.  And the crust....the crispy, chewy wonderful foundation that holds it all together.   It's a bit different.  But different in the best way.  There's some great pizza out there.  Different styles and different tastes.  Do yourself a favor.  If you're in the Banksville Rd./ Dormont area stop in this place....it's just delicious."
4,"I'm new to the area so I decided to try this place out and I was not disappointed. Very very good pizza, very nice staff, and the cashier/server super nice and friendly!! Been there twice already and plan on returning again and again!!"
1,"The Good: $1.75 per item tapas menu of dips, cheeses, and meets.  Gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian options.\n\nThe Bad:  The food was ok but the service and atmosphere are seriously lacking.  Very slow server.  (Would have given the place 3 stars if I didn't fall asleep at the table waiting for my bill)\n\nWhat it comes down to is that there is nothing that this place does any better than a Pita Jungle."
0,"I've been wanting to go here for a awhile but the line is always out the door and after finally eating there tonight I'm not sure why.  The food is mediocre at best in all honesty it tastes and looks like the food was microwaved.  My girlfriend remarked on our way out that \""the best part of the meal was the after dinner mint\""  Save your money for Carrabba\""s which has much better food."
4,"I travel for work, working different places for three months at a time.  I like to give the people I work with a nice fruit basket on my last day.  I've used Edible Arrangements in 7 states.  This store is by far the best I have ever experienced.  I used it once a couple of months ago and was very impressed, but thought it might have been a fluke.  But yesterday I bought another arrangement from them and I was thrilled!  All Edible Arrangement stores are not created equal - this store goes above and beyond the product description.  Absolutely delicious fruit, perfectly hand-dipped, arranged beautifully....and it seems to me they are generous with their portions.\n\nOverall, I like Edible Arrangements, but I LOVE this particular store!!  If you are looking for something besides the usual boring cookies to bring to a get-together, get yourself a fruit bouquet.  You will be the hit of the party."
3,"I've been to Stack a number of times and have always been pretty happy with my experience.  It's certainly one of your best bets within the Mirage.\n\nIt has one of the most interesting interiors I've seen in a restaurant in Vegas.  The whole space is wrapped in this striking \""flowing wood\"" pattern that makes it feel warm and cavernous.  If someone asked me to imagine in my head what a very modern take on the classic steakhouse vibe looked like, I can totally see this place showing up in my head.  My only gripe here is that the seating arrangements are pretty underwhelming; it's mostly basic tables within close proximity of each other and I wish they had something comfier.\n\nThe food is generally very good.  The filets have always been cooked perfectly and literally melt in my mouth.  The lobster is always tender, delicious and prepared as if though it has enjoyed a pleasant life swimming around in a sea of butter.  \n\nIf you're looking for the inventive side of menu it's pretty much all contained within their fun and delicious takes on comfort snacks.  The brie-filled tater tots explode with flavor the moment you take a bite.  The doughnuts are pretty good too.  However, the Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo - believe me when I say that I have never tasted a better version of this classic anywhere else in my life (don't tell my mom!)\n\nProportionally it's all small plates but I don't think I've ever left this place feeling unsatisfied.\n\nService is o.k.  I always feel accommodated in this place rather than taken care of but I've never had a bad experience."
3,4.5 Stars for me. \n\nIt is so challenging to find a good italian restaurant in the Charlotte area. We got drinks (very fresh) and an appetizer (the calamari was excellent). I got the flat bread pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil. My husband got the chicken parm which was delicious. It should be noted that he is Italian so his family makes chicken parm all the time and he said this one was the best restaurant version he's ever had. We were both too stuffed to try dessert but will definitely try that next time. \n\nThe service was great we had one waiter who took our order then another who kept our drinks filled. Also of note we went on a Friday night a little before the dinner rush (7 pm) as we had other plans for later. Overall a great experience and we will definitely be back.
3,"Keep it simple and you'll be impressed. Go with the Classics or the Kobe with potato chips and beer and the sweet potato fries. Unless you're trying to impress someone. Then ask for lots of napkins.\n\nMy burger was cooked perfectly and the beer was fresh and cold. Can't ask for more.\n\nService, well, I guess it depends on the mood of your server. I visited this place when I was attending a conference in June this year."
3,"Oh.  Mah.  Gawd.\n\nLet me get this out of the way.. the ONLY reason I'm dumping a star on America's Taco Shop is because they charge extra for chips and salsa.  I HATE that.  Charge me if I ask for extra salsa or something, but otherwise, come on.  \n\nNow.  Said chips?  Perfect.  Salsa?  Perfecter.  My taco?  Made me cry a little bit.  I am picky about corn tortillas, but these were brilliant.\n\nGo to America's Taco Shop.  I will see you there."
0,Total negative! Wouldnt take my groupon. Just lost 4 customers in line... we have our vouchers that is proof of payment its not our fault you dont have your stuff straight! Dont sell a groupon if youre not ready to take them. Used to be a regular now I'm never going back...
2,"Most of my visits to this place is because it is on my way home. \n\nI have been inside once and it was okay. Small because it is connected to the gas station.\n\nMost of my visits are through drive thru, on Tuesdays, catching the Tuesday special. Lines in the drive through can be long, but are mostly always fast. \n\nSometimes the guy in the drive thru is not the most friendliest, I guess he is trying to be fast and efficient.\n\nMake sure you check your order. I got spicy one time when I ordered mild. But other than that my chicken is always fresh and delicious."
0,"The Bellagio is considered one of the best properties on the strip - so how bad could the buffet possibly be? Well, think again. \n\nI'll just throw out a few of the oddities that struck me to make my lunch experience a truly miserable one. \n\nFirst, lunch was priced at 19.99 per the Bellagio website; when I arrived, I was inexplicably charged 24.99 plus tax. And, yes, it was a Monday. Add A Tip, and you're almost at twice the listed price for lunch. \n\n2) The tables are tiny. Even lunching alone, I had trouble even fitting one plate, one drink, and my cutlery. \n\n3) There is no indication as to whether drinks are included in the price. There is no drinks menu. I still don't know if I could've gotten wasted on buckets of Lager or had a glass of champagne. \n\n4) While there is a cotton napkin - SINGULAR - there is nothing else you could put your fork and knife on as the napkin sits on your lap. So, throughout your buffet experience, your fork and knife will sit right on the ageing, dirty-looking wodden tabletop with hygienic (!) tile inserts. I really had to struggle. Would it be so hard to just supply either two cotton napkins or at least a paper napkin to set your cutlery down? \n\n5) Going along the same lines, the plates are amongst the flattest I have ever seen. Who needs deep plates with oil and vinegar, pasta sauce, or other liquid food components? And, as you might have guessed, you WILL end up spilling vinegar or oil or whatever it is all over your wooden table - which drastically works together with number 4) to ensure that you don't have a napkin to wipe clean the mess - so you end up with a table too small, full of oil, vinegar, and with no dry space to set your fork down!\n\n6) Did I mention that the drink comes with plenty of ice, but no cardboard set? Condensing water just adds to the oil-vinegar mess that already burdens your table. \n\n7) Whoever set up the actual buffet stations should be publicly flogged! Soup station: The soup ladle is TOO LONG to maneuver between the protective glass roof and the soup kettle! How on earth are you supposed to get your soup if you keep wiggling the ladle between the glass roof and the kettle???? Next station: Wood-oven Pizza. While the Pizza does look good, to reach the back row under the yet again too low glass divider, there is no way to fetch a slice without drenching your cuff IN front-row Pizza. Despite being REALLY annoying, I am shocked to see that the health department apparently does not see reason to intervene. I truly had to puke a little when I saw this setup!\n\n8) I don't really remember what the food selection was like; I was too busy trying to forget about the Bellagio Pizza (Spinach, Mushrooms, and patrons' cuff). But what I do remember is that there were sausages, BUT NO KETCHUP. There were sausage links - BUT NO MUSTARD. \n\n9) Lastly, the checkin section is a joke. There are three randomly positioned cash desks at the entrance - once you're done paying, though, you are thrown in turmoil yet again. The line to the hostess actually requires you to backtrack to where you come from- resulting in chaos as people who are trying to pay stand alongside a queue of folks that already paid. Did I mention that your receipt is handed over to you stapled i n a real awkward way that prevents you from putting it into your pocket? So you stand in the waiting flock (it certainly ain't a queue) - with your semi-circular receipt in hand? \n\nDon't be fooled. All these 4 and 5 star reviews must be from folks who don't know any better and who are surprised that the Buffet at the Bellagio offers a selection beyond Arby's. I, for my part, was shocked, and am glad to leave this place."
0,"**THIS COMPANY IS A FRAUD MONEY STEALING BLACK HOLE.**\nDo not trust this company with any of your car rentals. I arrived a few hours earlier than the reserved pickup time. I asked if it was alright to pick up the car earlier than the reservation without any extra charges and they said it was fine and I already reserved the car for the extra hours (supposedly). I put a $27 insurance on top of for the day, thinking it was a simple $27 charged. A $92 total balance for the rental for one day in Vegas wasn't too bad. THING AGAIN! I was billed an extra $114! For a total of $186 for ONE DAY! I argued with the manager who gave a \""I could care less\"" attitude and said the extra charges where a 40% tax on top of other fee's in relation to the insurance I accepted and the EXTRA HOURS. They never mentioned these fees when I went to pick up my car, and ofcourse they charged me for the extra hours which they stated at first were already included in the $72 previous balance when I reserved the car.\n\nI wasn't able to get my money refunded. \n\nDON'T TRUST YOURSELF WITH THIS COMPANY. HORRIBLE LYING CUSTOMER SERVICE, CRUEL ATTITUDE TO ANY OF YOUR NEEDS, AND OUTRAGEOUS HIDDEN FEE'S"
2,"I've had better burgers before. Fries were pretty good. Definitely wouldn't pay that price again, too expensive. Place was kind of dirty."
4,"this is where we go after we turn in any big paper, take exams and/or have oral arguments\n\nbasically, it's good enough to keep going back to\n\nand worth of a celebration\n\ntry the mezze platter and sample everything!!!"
0,"While I have visited before and the service/food was good... things have gone downhill. I went with a group last weekend. We were told 45 minutes to get a table while we saw several tables open and waiting to be cleaned. We waited at the bar and I literally stared at the bartender for 20 minutes without any luck. Finally a friend spoke up and tried to get her attention. She finally comes over and says \""did you just holler at me?\"" Well after 20 minutes of not acknowledging our presence we had to. Then he had to mention that I was waiting and first in line. I asked for a house glass of wine and she served me a $10 glass. The manager then comes over and tells my friend, THE CUSTOMER, to apologize to the waitress for 'hollering' at her. The bartender was horrible. The service was the worst I have received in a long time. Will not be back ever again. What a huge disapointment."
1,"I got to the airport nice and early the other day and was delighted to see that delux was serving breakfast. It sounded delicious... the perfect sandwich. One of their yummy buns with two eggs, bacon and sausage. Heck yeah.\n\nUnfortunatly it wasn't near as good as it looked and sounded. Eggs had been cooked a while ago and were a bit dry and the bun wasn't the yummy soft, fresh bun it should have been.\n\nFries were great. Maybe the burgers are better."
4,"born and raised in new york.. this diner beats any ny diner i've been to. it's unfortunate, but true. get the pancakes."
4,"What a joy! The food is not only fantastic it is good quality. There is something on the menu for everyone. Has lots of health smart choices if you're cutting calories and it has something for those who don't care. Candice was our server, she is very informative, knows her menu, best personality and brought our food out while it was hot!!!! I will definitely be back and intend to have my morning meetings there, for those who know Butterfields...this is your new place!"
3,"I think I'm glad that I didn't try Red Koi when it first opened.  They've had some time to work the kinks out.  We've been here at least five times and have had consistently great food and service.  Their entrees are fabulous (love the Bento box for lunch - $7).  My husband tried the noodle soup and he thought it was great.  Their chicken katsu is made the right way (thin chicken breast, panko breadcrumbs, crispy).  We've tried sushi and many of the entrees...EVERYTHING was good.  It's so great to have this little gem so close to home.  The kids even love it.  We'll be back!"
3,"I frequent The Gun Store when shopping for a new gun. They have a large inventory. I always want to hold a gun, check the action and trigger pull before buying a new model. The staff on the retail side have been very helpful and don't mind letting me check out multiple guns even if I am not buying that day. I bought a Kimber Ultra CDP 1911 there. Good selection of magazines too. The range is too busy with tourists for locals like me to use it ."
4,My favorite place to eat at in Vegas.  Been coming here for many years and I can't get enough.  The Greek salad along with everything else are amazing.  Their food is fresh and tasty and cooked to order.  Can't beat it.
0,"Been going there for years, repairs always done fairly, until this week.  AC fan motor stopped blowing.  took it in, it was a fuse.  Wanted to charge me $100, talked down to $75.  Got car home, radio button different, and covered with grease.  Called back to tell them of this, crack in radio face, and the lights on the radio now don't come on.  I cannot believe the yelling and ranting at me.  I thought telling him of the issues would encourage him to work with his employees.  Instead, he has lost a customer."
4,"On our first morning in Vegas during our most recent trip, I just typed in Best Breakfast in Yelp and this restaurant came up! I was lured by the fact that Adam from Man Vs Food had come here and wanted to try it out! \n\nThe location: Imperial Palace.. My first thought: REALLY?! Uff. But off we went!\n\nImperial Palace was going through major renovations.. The entire front section was closed off.. We had to park next door at Bill's? I think that's what it was called.. After nearly falling to my death by slipping on wet floors, we located the restaurant which was on the second floor. Once you go up there, it's like you're not even in Imperial Palace anymore! The restaurant decor was really cool and hip (awesome that I just used that word, I know). The wait was about 20 minutes.. I'm not sure if they took reservations but we just walked in. \n\nI tried the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. OH MY GOODNESS. I was IN LOVE with this dish. When it came out, I swear I thought that I could probably only finish half (the portion was HUGE. It was the size of a small dog). But to my surprise.. I finished 80% of it. Shocking, I know. But you guys, this was so amazing. It was biscuit.. mashed potatoes.. scrambled eggs.. cheese.. fresh spinach.. fried chicken.. chipotle sauce.. OMG the goodness was overwhelming! I could NOT stop EATING and probably gained 3lbs but it was AMAZING! And I can't wait to go back!\n\nALSO! PS - get the Kiwi Watermelon drink. Super yummy!"
1,"Pizza always takes over an hour, but tonight it took nearly two. We called to check on our order, and were put on hold - twice. When the pizza finally arrived, it was cold.\n\nWe love that they have a gluten-free option (even though it's TINY and $10), we love that they have $5 pizzas, AND we love that they deliver! \n\nHowever, waiting nearly 2 hours for cold pizza with not even an apology is not something I'm interested in doing again.\n\nI hate giving negative reviews to new businesses, because I really try to like them, but sometimes it's necessary. Something big has to change, or Geno's won't stay in business very long."
4,"This is a crazy ass thrill ride.  It wasn't on my agenda, but I got sucked into it.  When I was on the Zoomline (at night), it was near freezing and there was a heavy wind chill factor.  Dropping down out of the starting gate, sober, and flying like Superman over Fremont Street was a righteous trip.  I'd certainly do it again."
2,"I must say I've heard a lot of raving reviews from my friends when it comes to sushi so i came here with high expectations.  I also took a lot of cues from my friends and ordered the \""screaming orgasm\"" and a bowl of french onion soup. \n\nThe soup was wonderful, served in a clay pot with plenty of onions and cheese, but the screaming orgasm left me a bit underwhelmed, especially for the price.  Maybe I'm too new to the sushi scene to make a judgement, but I remember having a similar dish at Sushi Fever which was a lot better and for a lower price.\n\nIt's not to say I wouldn't try it again, but I would definitely order something else."
2,"A nice, relaxed, and sleek little club.  Plenty of tables for bottle service and a decent sized dance floor for getting your game on.  If you're not in the market for bottle service, then there are two fully loaded bars at opposite ends of the club.\n\nThere are plenty of platforms for female revelers to attempt their best impersonation of a fully-clothed exotic dancer.  Just don't try to dance on the same stage as the paid go-gos though.\n\nDrink prices...well we all know about that.  \n\nThe Hard Rock caters to an edgy, yet mature crowd.  Expect this type of clientele at Vanity.\n\nThe thing I like about Vegas clubs is that they cater to a specific genre of customer.  I like the vibe at Vanity.  I'll always love Tao, but it doesn't hurt to venture to other spots every now and then.\n\nBig thanks to Brian Sweet, VIP manager, my party had a great time.\n\nSo much so, I may celebrate my next birthday here.\n\nIt's just more relaxed..."
0,"I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back......ever\nSave your money, or starve either would be a better option"
3,make sure you enjoy your waffles and chicken onsite. it doesn't taste nearly as good heated up at home.\n\nweekends are busy so try to go during non-peak times in the evening.\n\ntourists: servers are sassy and the waffles are one of the top ten you'll ever taste!
2,"Total bargain for students, with 50% food up until 4pm daily.\n\nKudos to our server for coughing up some attitude at my 40 year old cousin who tried passing off her student ID to get the student discount.\n\nDon't take the attitude out on me because I was the one that outed her as you scrupulously eyed up the tattered ID.  You weren't the one to face the wrath of my aunt and cousin for the rest of the week for outing her on her real age.\n\nEnough family drama, perhaps CA living has made me a bit jaded or that I'm a little older,  but the food here is bit lackluster.  Lots of volume, and very little substance.  Just like college kids!  The menu is creative and offers a lot of variety and a number of veggie options and the prices are great, but its nothing worth driving cross town for.\n\nOk, maybe that blue cornbread."
2,"The classic diner interior is appealing and well maintained. An OK place for a basic breakfast though the food is not remarkable. My hash browns were lacking flavour and had been over cooked. I could not eat the sausages. I was given butter from a plastic container even though others got fresh butter, and it had a bad plastic taste. My waitress was very kind when I asked for the real deal, and even swapped out my bagel. The service was friendly and welcoming. I would go back, though I wouldn't recommend waiting in a line if that's what you're faced with."
3,"A lifelong Las Vegas resident and friend brought me there. Honestly I would have never just pulled up and went in. Just looked like a local Local's place. Not on the main tourist drive.\nOK, could not have been more wrong! In business since 1950 (yes I was alive). Same family, great tradition and even better, great homemade Mexican food. All I can say is when someone visits us, there are place we make sure we take them. Our list just grew by one! :- )\nGood food, good service and you get to support a family that helped mold our great city by feeding the stars who's pictures are on the walls."
0,"I would AVOID this BUG ridden place!! They are not only dirty but they can not get your order right. They made me late to work and then when I called to tell them that they gave me the wrong bagel, I was told it was my problem. Nice isn't it? They have a high counter so you can't see what they are doing behind the counter. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!! Its over priced and just gross!!  The men that work there can't speak good english and are absolutely rude!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Being from Iowa I mourned the loss of Panchero's when I moved out here.  I was SO EXCITED when someone finally franchised it out here in PHX but I have to agree with a lot of others that the vibe of this location doesn't live up to the ones I visited back home.\n\nPeople like to compare P's to Chipotle but I have to scream \""its not even close!!!!\"" when I hear that.  Pancheros fresh presses and cooks their tortillas in front of you so you don't get some flour-y mess that sat on a truck for days waiting to be delivered then sits in a warmer until you order.  They also give your burrito a nice mixing that way you don't get a bite of pico, a bite of rice, a bite of chicken and a mouthful of sour cream when you eat your burrito.\n\nThe reason I don't give this place 5 stars is the staff.  Sometimes I go and the staff is friendly and attentive.  Other times I go and the staff ignores me to play around and I feel awkward because I am not part of the inside joke.  Other times the staff is just plain incompetent like the girl who burned my Quesadilla twice and another staff member had to step in to complete my order.\n\nAll in All I give the place a 5 for food, 5 for value and a 1 for customer service/staff."
4,This place is awesome! I always go here because it's just down the street from work and I have never had a bad meal. It is a little pricey though.
1,"Service was terrible.  We waited in line forever, and then when we got our food, I received mine expediently, and then my companions didn't get theirs for over 20 minutes.  We did talk with the manager and their food was comp'ed, so that redeemed the situation slightly.\n\nI was also unimpressed with their selection.  Every menu should have something vegan or something that can be made vegan to accommodate those who choose to not consume animal products.  I see two other reviewers highlighted this as an issue.  \n\nI'm giving it two stars instead of one because the coffee was good and they had almond milk and stevia for it...although there was no counterspace to make your coffee (for those of us not getting something fancier than just a cup o' joe)."
3,"A great new addition to the DeMarco family of ventures.  This was a pre-opening tasting, so they're still working on all of the fine points.  Nonetheless, it is a terrific spot.  The structure itself is very appealing, as they restored a 1940's-era building and exposed its beautiful brickwork, which is complimented with a stained concrete floor.  The bar is a proper one with a wide array of liquors and fairly ample seating for the size of the space.  The patio definitely will be the preferred seating choice so long as the weather cooperates.  We tried macaroni and cheese as well as the cole slaw starters; for $3 each, you could make a delicious, reasonably-priced meal from a collection of the starters.  The double dip starter (cobb dip and posole salsa with chips) was very good, though I almost preferred the dip and salsa without the chips because they're so flavorful.  The mixed grain salad was a good choice, too, though I might try to find something other than the orange vinagrette to put on it.  The wine on tap was tasty, and they'll also have a small list of about 8 bottles.  Again, the official opening isn't until the 25th, so they're still honing the fine edges.  In any event, we'll be there far too often for our own good!"
1,"I was here yesterday and they were having their big holiday sale. They threw a whole bunch of products into a bin and I picked a few out and went to the counter to check out, where they told me they weren't on clearance. Then she tried to get me to buy it at full price. It was disappointing and I still don't get why things that aren't on clearance are in clearance bins..."
0,"I was close to canceling my order and leaving... Manager is a jerk. Wouldn't let my colleague smoke on the Patio. \nCaptain Crunch roll tasted like ass... Soy Sauce tastes like kikkoman... Happy hour prices are worse that other places regular prices. We'll never come back.  \nOhhh... The servers are cool, just the manager is a Jerk."
1,"I was really excited to try this place but so disappointed once I did. Worst mac and cheese I had in a while. Chicken was very so-so. Nothing was on point. I don't get the hype over this place. Plus, it wasn't cheap."
2,"Items selected:\n\nCoffee\nFrozen Hot Chocolate French Toast - Chocolate French Toast, Triple Stacked with Strawberries, Topped with Pistachio Nuts, Chocolate Sauce & Whipped Cream\nBalsamic Strawberry Cream Waffles - Freshly Sliced Strawberries, Macerated in Balsamic Glaze & Cream, Sandwiched between 2 Jumbo Waffles, topped with Fresh Strawberries & Drizzled in Chocolate\nCarrot Cake Sundae - \""I Thought I Saw a Wabbit\"" Vanilla & Butter Pecan Ice Cream, Heavenly Carrot Cake, Maple Walnut & White Chocolate Fudge,Topped with Whipped Cream\n\nNever particularly interested in spending a New York meal on Serendipity 3 and always assuming the restaurant would function better with a group given the size of the portions I found myself awaiting a friend from Columbus at the Caesar's Palace hot spot during my favorite Vegas time - early Sunday morning when the only people on the strip are those just wandering home from Saturday night or those cleaning up after them.  Quiet in a good way with cheesy 80's music playing overhead and as much kitsch and scripted-happy service as I'd expected it would be mere seconds after I was seated that coffee was filled and with both my friend and I favorite sweets to savories our decision was simple - both items arriving after numerous coffee refills in all their gluttonous glory.  Understanding that Serendipity is more about fun than fine dining it was really no surprise that the bottom slice of French Toast was somewhat dry due to a lack of whipped cream saturation and although decent certainly nothing I'd order again and yet what was surprising was the high quality of the Waffles - both golden and crunchy on the exterior with a soft, pliable inside and nicely balanced between sweet and savory by the balsamic strawberries and chocolate.  Satisfied but unwilling to leave Serendipity without sampling one of their signature sundaes the meal was capped with the carrot cake version, a substantial chunk of dense cake complete with cream cheese icing buried in ice cream, walnuts, fudge, and whipped cream that really had no chance of failing in the flavor department if you enjoy sweets, though perhaps a touch less 'subtle' than some like their breakfasts...or lunches...or dinners."
3,"The Cafe in the Palace Station has the most enormous, delicious sandwiches and burgers."
2,"Great place, very nice and clean, friendly staff, amazing beer selection. BUT, they are SO slow. If you order a beer, it should be at your table in 2-3 minutes - not 8-10. And, if you run out of something - you should tell the table that immediately. They are consistently slow.... If you're a slow person - then you'll love this place."
3,I've eaten here every time I'm in town.   Great food and great view of the fountains at the Bellagio.
3,"You're in the vicinity of Black Canyon City. Your pickings are (or at least appear to be) slim. Do you stop at Rock Springs Cafe?\n\nYes, yes you do. \n\nA reliable road food stop as long as you avoid the weirder corners of the menu, you can fuel up on a pretty damn tasty breakfast or lunch, wander the farmer's market, and gorge yourself on a delicious if slightly unconventional homemade pie. The pies are huge and the slices are generous.\n\nThe meringue tends to catch people off guard; it's not the typical airy meringue, but seems to be more of a Swiss meringue with marshmallow creme added. (Per my parents, this is apparently considered a \""normal\"" variation in the Midwest. And I'm sure Paula Deen has heard of it too.) It's wet, it's dense, it's soft, and it's delicious if it doesn't send you into some sort of diabetic coma. If that's not your scene, stick to the fruit pies.\n\nIf you're headed home, you can grab a whole pie to go. They've got a punch card program for whole pies, too, scoring you a freebie after you buy enough.\n\nAs the obvious stopping point, it's also a great place to people watch and meet other travelers. Unwind a little and take your chances; that grizzled biker is probably friendlier than you think. (Results not guaranteed.)"
0,"this place has gone down since the owners are no longer involved as much! We have been going here for over 3 years and food was used to be fresh, tasty, and service was excellent. Well we went there December 7, 2014 and not only the service we received was horrible. We ordered a plate that showed it had sunny side up eggs in it. so i asked can you be sure the eggs are in fact sunny side up and soft and she said sure. When i got the plate the eggs were scrambled and mixed in with the rest of the stuff on the plate when I complained she gave me an attitude and even at first said we have no money back policy??? but then she refunded us for that plate.  But that's not it... before they used to use fresh lemon juice for their tabouleh sauce so it tasted really good, they use something bottled now so it tastes acidic and really not good anymore, i ordered a Turkish coffee and everyone knows Turkish coffee is served very much the size of an espresso. They brought it in a beer glass and i am looking at it in disbelief thinking these people don't know what Turkish coffee is, anyone drinking that much of a strong coffee will get a heart attack! So no more business from us....  I should give them no stars really."
0,"Easily the worst and most frustrating bar in town. Expect a 20 minute wait on a drink whether they're busy or not. Don't expect a smile from the bartender. Don't expect them to check on you when sitting at the bar... I couldn't even get a napkin with my dinner. The food I have had is actually really good, but I only ordered the basics like a grilled cheese and chips with salsa. It's not worth the ghastly staff, or frat boy rude customers. Just avoid at all costs."
4,"I've been in health care for a decade and THIS is the only pediatrician office I know of that is open 6 days a week year round and 7 days a week during the cold/flu season! Not only was my kid's appointment honored ON TIME but I was in and out in half an hour! Oh, AND the doctors are really nice! :)"
4,Their lattes and Corditos are amazing.
0,If I could give this no stars I would. I would never return to this pool and we are currently staying at Caesars. After a hassle to get in (which thank god I was on a VIP list and didn't have to pay) I think my husband and I stayed in here for a half hour tops. I'm no prude so topless optional does NOT bother me. I'm not a jealous boring type wife. What I don't like is being treated like shit from employees and being ignored just because were a couple together. Don't worry..we took our money elsewhere where it was appreciated and gladly taken! There was all of 10 people here as well and the only ones topless were 50+.
3,"The restaurant was very dark but had a nice view of the strip. Probably a really nice place to eat on the patio during the summer. Decent view of the Bellagio fountain show, even though there are a bunch of big ass trees in the way!! That's all on Bellagio though... \n\nGot the hanger steak and it was really good. Escargo was decent as well. Service was ok and so were the prices. \n\nGo here for a classy, nice meal for an above average price."
3,The service here is awesome.\nCool little hardware store.
4,"Tried unPHOgettable, the name captured me. Had #8 pho and my brother had #25, they were both ridiculously delicious. My pho was cooked amazingly well, added tofu, which was brilliant, and the jasmin iced tea was pretty great as well. Anybody who wants a well priced delicious bowl of pho, this is your next stop!"
2,"This place is great to host any big event.  I worked the Charlotte Motorcycle Show this weekend and everything was very organized the staff at the Convention Center is friendly and there is plenty of places to park near by.  Vending machines, Starbucks, Bojangles and a few other place to grab some munchies.  I really enjoyed the traveling bands that were playing all weekend on my breaks.  Looking for a space for a more upscale event the Convention Center can host that as well ask them about the Grand Ballroom!"
4,Absolutely delicious chocolate fondue.... Nuff' said!
3,"Amazing pastries! I always look forward eagerly to their stand at the Farmer's Market. I'm not a huge danish fan usually, but they have the best damn cheese danish I have ever had, and now I buy one pretty much every week in the summer. When they aren't sold out by the time I get there. \n\n  I cannot comment on any of their other food, since I have only had the pastries. It's probably a 5 star kind of place overall, but I don't want to rate what I haven't tried."
3,"We've seen a bunch of movies at this theater over the years, so I am surprised I haven't written a review just yet.  Most recently, we went to see  \""The Blind Side.\""  (Loved it by the way and highly recommend it).  \n\nSome of the things I like about this movie theater:\n*Great movie selection\n*Comfortable seats\n*Validated underground parking\n*Easy access to Biltmore Fashion Mall, True Food, and Houston's\n*Popcorn and other tasty treats\n*Clean bathrooms\n*Very good times compared to other theaters\n\nAnd just a few things I've noted during my visits to this theater:\n-escalators not always dependable\n-expensive concessions\n-ticket prices consistent with other theaters but still on the steep side!\n\nThat being said, I'm sure I'll continue to frequent this theater - keep the customer service, movie selection, etc... coming.  Just do me a favor and keep the prices where they're at.. no need to keep raising ticket prices!  Happy viewing all!"
1,"eeeeek....ate here twice. had italian beef, disgusting,terrible  bread stale   pizza everything was good on it but sauce had funny taste to it."
2,"To be blunt, I'm baffled at the amount of love the burgers here received on Yelp.  Really just not that good.  The meat was dry and overcooked, the toppings were boring and it was pretty small.  The only reason this place received 3 stars from me was the OUTSTANDING soup!  The roasted corn and poblano chowder was absolutely delicious.  I wanted to stop by the nearest U of I frat house and borrow a beer bong to take down a vat of this soup--yea, it was that good!  Overall, the Courier Cafe just feels kind of old (kind of like the burgers taste), but, do yourself a favor and order a giant bowl of that soup!"
0,"Did I eat at the same restaurant as everyone else? I am SHOCKED by the glowing reviews.\nBurger was tasteless, bland, and had no condiments on it- just butter on the bun. Fine, if you're going to do that, at least provide some ketchup when you drop off the burger.\nKale Caesar- ughhhhh... no. Just don't do it. I don't know what kind of dressing was on that salad, but it wasn't like any kind of Caesar dressing I've ever tasted. \nTruffle Fries- these were fine. Everyone does truffle fries though, so these were nothing special. The ketchup tastes homemade and a lot like marinara sauce, which was kind of a fun twist.\nMilkshakes- these were ok. We had two different ones and while they are nothing to rave about (I saw all of those pints of Haagen Dazs in your reach-in freezer, good to know that I can make these at home) it was just OK. I've had better milkshakes at In N Out Burger or Dick's Drive In.\n\nI did appreciate that they seated us right away (pregnant lady right here) instead of making us wait in line. And service was super friendly. So there's that."
1,"The atmosphere is very nice for a Sports bar, however, the food and service were not impressive.  We went on a Sunday for lunch.  The wings were good, but the rest of the food was very average.   We waited a long time for the food to come and it was not very hot when we received it.  I realize we were there at a busy time, but found our server too busy to check on our table and take care of our needs.  We even waited for our bill!  I probably will not go back."
4,This place is great!! Went here on a whim cause it was open pretty late on a Saturday. The pizza is so good I ate the whole thing to myself. The only bad thing is I was to full to order any of the crepes! They looked delicious as well.
3,Went for lunch and had the French Dip sandwich....very good choice but man what a gutbuster!!!
4,"This is a really great little store that has been here for as long as I can remember.\n Great location, right on the corner of Camelback and Central.\n The selections are amazing,fruit and vegetables you never find at other shops.\nThe bakery is really good ,even though most items are made at other shops, it is all about convienance.\nThe Wine selection is amazing and the staff knows all about them as well as the hard liquor. What they do not have they can order for you.\n True is is a bit of a higher price but, it is always a nice time shopping here."
4,"Wow!!! What amazing and talented performers, stage hands, engineering, lighting..etc, etc..The performance was simply spectacular\n\nI was beyond amazed at the brilliant design of the water stage and at times you just simply have to sit back and enjoy the show.. and not try and think about..\""how do they do that?!\"" I was really scared for the performers as they swung and dived from what seemed to be ten stories up from the top of the expansive and ever growing stage, but that is all part of the thrill I suppose.. Just watching these talented people challenge their bodies, physics and human logic to attempt these incredible acrobatic feats and make it look as easy as backing out of the driveway, was really incedible. \n\nI would love to see it again in a heartbeat!"
1,Fire Doug! I have been here twice and the service is incredibly slow. You cannot get a hot sub because Doug takes f o r e v e r. I waited 20 minutes for two subs today. TWENTY MINUTES! \nThe food is good (if you like cold subs) and the place is clean but I will not be returning.
2,"A nice looking wine bar. However they force you to order food, which they didn't tell us until after we had finished our bottle of wine. When we ask for the bill is not the time to inform us that we are required to order food. Before we are seated would have been a better time. Unimpressed. \n\nStill, a good place to go on a date, as I saw lots of couples around. The waitress who seated us was not very friendly, however our server was very nice, and knowledgeable.\n\n$90 with tax and tip for a bottle of wine."
2,"So from my understanding, Maid Cafes are basically cosplay restaurants except every one is dressed as maids. Neat concept in my opinion. \n\nMy friends and I came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch. I had already came there when it was Anime Ramen so I thought it'd be cool to see what had changed. From what I remembered the food was OK and from this visit, it stayed OK. I got the katsu bento box. Nothing really special about it. The price for the food was a little high for me but I don't mind if I get a 'maid experience'. The waitress that we had wasn't dressed in a maid outfit.. she just had on a hello kitty t-shirt with cat ears and tail... I guess that would work if it was still Anime Ramen but now that the store is going for the Maid Caf\u00e9 theme, then everyone should be in character. Service was good just that it was lacking the Maid experience. Probably won't be back since nothing really stood out from their menu.. they had ramen and other Japanese items but tastier finds can be found somewhere else."
4,"Sit outside, get a drink, and enjoy a show that begins every 30 minutes.  The shows are short but is different every time and very entertaining.  And did I mention that it's FREE!!!"
4,Service was excellent. Server took her time to explain everything to us. \n\nPizza was perfect. Tomato sauce was done right. Crust was light and crispy. \n\nMeatball was great. Big and perfect with the sauce. \n\nThe mud pie was amazing. The coffee ice cream helped balance the chocolate crust. \n\nDefinitely coming back to try the other pizzas and desserts.
4,"I don't feel the need to write an incredibly elaborate review for this place, but I will say this... their burgers rival the best i've ever had. I miss this place so hard. Fat Heads, I love u."
0,"For the past few years, my employees and I attend an annual conference at the MGM Grand and I take the dozen or so employees to lunch at the Rainforest cafe--not anymore! The food and service this past week when we dined was awful!! It took nearly an hour to get our tasteless, mediocre and overpriced food. If you are looking for good food and service, go to another restaurant and avoid the Rainforest cafe at the MGM!!!"
1,"I have been here at least 8 times or more, the food is not that great, the food takes about 30-45 to get to the table after you order!! The NEW Raul and Theresa's on Mcdowell and Litchfield is GARBAGE!! I ordered the fish tacos and \""I SWEAR TO GOD\"" I got food poisoning!!!!  Why my family comes here... I have no Clue!!! You will be disappointed!!!"
0,"Very dissapointing. I went there last night with 3 friends. I waited for 15 minutes without anyone seating us and then we waited another 15 minutes at a table without anyone coming up to us, even to give us menus. We left. I really hope this place gets their act together. I live downtown and I want it to do well."
4,I recently moved into the Pointe at U of I.  The move in went smooth.  There where a couple small maintenance items which where addressed quickly.  I am use to living on campus and its amazing the difference in response time at this property.
0,"I have eaten at this restaurant about a dozen times and always been impressed by their food (but sadly, neglected to review it during the good times).  Fortunately, at the time, my companions made it a point to post positive reviews of the restaurant.  So, when I had relatives visiting from out of town, looking for a late night meal, I proudly recommended Ferraro's. \n\nThe restaurant could not possibly have made me look worse than with the sad events earlier tonight.  The back patio - normally quiet and sane - was booked for a private party and it was loud and rocking.  No problem by itself, but I wonder if it left the dining room understaffed.\n\nNot to belabor the details, but the meals we were served would have been terrible by Olive Garden standards.  Each of our three entrees were served cold (you'd have to heat them a few degrees to get to lukewarm) and were mostly inedible.  The fact that all three of us left 80% of our meals untouched was clearly lost on the busboy who was surprised that none of us requested a doggy bag.  After waiting 45 minutes for our food to arrive, none of us was in the mood to even consider a re-order even if it had been offered - which (it's important to note) it was NOT.  Our waitress simply dropped off our check and rushed off to the next table.\n\nI don't know if any of this was because the kitchen was overwhelmed, or if the one lone waitress in the dining room didn't bring them out quickly enough - and quite frankly I don't care.\n\nIt may have been just another day on their schedule and - oops - they messed up during a pre-booked party, but it was a very important event in my life and that meal was simply unacceptable.  \n\nCertainly by my previous experiences, and by the reviews of others on this page, your odds favor a good experience.  But I like to leave my gambling at the tables and - now that this restaurant is clearly not a sure thing - take my business elsewhere.\n\nOh, yes... shame on you, Ferraro's.  When you stop caring about one customer, how long before you stop caring about them all?  Keep offering 1/2 off deals for locals and then treating us like crap. It's a guaranteed long-term recipe for failure."
3,"On the upside;\n-food was great! (Got the chicken and waffles)\n-great ranch and BBQ sauce!\n-clean\n-did not get charged when I had to change my order after it was made\n-manager offered me some more bread while I waited for my food to be corrected, very kind\n\nOn the downside;\n-out waiter this particular day was exhausted and thus the service lacked , not to mention we had to look at our food \nfor 5 min because he forgot to give us silverware \n\nOverall do recommend. Their menu is great and has a great variety. The burgers are huge and the salmon is awesome!"
0,"As we had done in previous years following a Steelers game, we came to this place as it was conveniently located from our hotel, the Sheraton Station Square. The eight of us sat in a booth that had a few dishes remaining from the previous customers. Around 15 minutes passed without anyone greeting us for service or removing the dishes. Finally a young girl came to take our order. She apologized and cleaned off our table.\n\nWe ordered and then waited at least 30 minutes. A girl from our group went to question what was going on. Eventually the manager came out, apologized and said the food would be out in 3 minutes. At least 10 minutes passed. We questioned him again this time verbally expressing our irritation. He mentioned he fired 4 workers and took the blame. Regardless, we were all disgruntled.\n\nThen several minutes later the waitress came out and said she did not have any avocado and another ingredient and a few of our dishes could not be made. This was something they could have told us before we ordered and had to wait 40 or so minutes. One of the dishes that was supposed to have bacon came with baco bits instead. \n\nThe manager agreed to not bill us for the few items we received and with that we got up and left.\n\nWhile I do give credit to the manager and particularly to the young girl who was apologetic and did her best despite the circumstances, I find this kind of service unacceptable. This place is clearly mismanaged and this level of service has convinced me to never ever come to this bar again.\n\nIn order for this or any establishment to retain customers, it is important that they are fully prepared to service customers and if they are not then they at least communicate that to us early on so that our time is not wasted."
1,"The place had horrible lighting and the place just seemed dingy. The waitress was nice, but we were the only ones in the restaurant which makes me a little weary. The food was overpriced for the quality that you received. I LOVE indian food and this place was way under expectation and my standard. I would never recommend this place to anyone."
0,"We ate on 9/14/11 at lunch. One of the four of us ordered Pad Thai noodles with chicken, hot level 3 (1 to 10 levels). At 11:30 pm my 80 year old mother spent the entire night until 5:30 am vomiting. That was Wednesday, today is Sunday and she still has nausea and feels terrible. taking a anti-nausea over the counter medicine the pharmacist recommended. My parents traveled to Las Vegas to celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary from Denver. The vacation has been ruined because we choose to eat at Archi's.  This morning she ate a piece of toast we hope she will feel good enough to travel Tuesday."
1,"Use to love this place... Service and food have gone downhill, while prices have continued to go up."
1,"I am of Indian origin, so I am picky about Indian food at restaurants. I don't eat out much at Indian places, so I haven't tracked ownership changes or what that has done for Indian cuisine. \n\nI ordered the malai kofta, which was $8.50. Might have been reasonable if it had come with a decent portion of rice. And had more than 3 kofta balls in that tangy sauce. Or if the extra rice in a thimble wasn't $1.50! I have had giant food portion for $10 at sit down restaurants with amazing ambience. I am not saying the place is expensive, just that the portion was way too tiny even for cheap places. You have to order at the counter, eat off flimsy paper plates that tip over at the slightest touch and clean up after you BUT there is a large tip blank on your bill which you have to sign in front of the attendant. And if you eat at Indian restaurants, you know well about the service that leaves you squirming. Woodlands was no exception. \n\nThe chutney bar was a decent idea - the tomato chutney was actually good. I have sort of given up on decent sambhar or chutney. I suggest taking the effort to drive out a couple more miles to Little India in Tempe. For 5.99, you get that same quanity of subji, two rotis, large portion of pulav and pickle."
2,"Between the two major Goodwill Stores in the 'Burgh--the other one is on Ohio Street--this seems to be the better one.  Parking here is a little tight--the lot is very small for this size store.  \n\nOn the upside, this store is very well organized.  They usually have stuff according to size.  The menswear is very well organized  and extensive.  On the downside, you do have to do a lot of poking around to find what you are looking for--especially if you are into vintage dresses like I am.  This isn't so much a haven for vintage wear.  I would imagine that in tough economic times as these, people come here more and more just to find everyday wear.\n\nThey do have a good selection of used books.  I bought \""East of Eden\"" from John Steinbeck here for $1.00 and an old copy of \""David Copperfield\"" by Charles Dickens for 75 cents."
0,"Bad food and service AND they try to cheat you on the tip!\n\nI should have listened to other Yelp reviews but I was craving some of the menu items that you can't find in other places.  The food was mediocre to bad and the portions are small for the price they charge.  The soy sauce soy milk had a burnt taste; sesame pancake was hard; I won't go on. \n\nWhen I received the check, the server already included a 15% tip (for lunch) when he provided no service (one of our items never came, teapot was never refilled, had to flag him down for every little thing we needed).  I paid with credit card and on the signature slip, it said \""PRE-TIP AMT\"" next to the total which clearly included tip.  For folks who don't look at their bill closely, they will end up over tipping for non-existent service."
3,"Room was clean.  Hotel needs to be renovated.  Food was too over priced.  Hotel staff was friendly.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay."
2,"I'm a spoiled Cali beyotch. And if it weren't for the god awful amount of cigarette smoke permeating my pores, I'm sure this would be a decent place. But honestly the smoke was so bad we ran out after one drink. It's bad. But it was packed so I presume I'm in the minority on this one."
1,"I went here last night slummin'.  Uh huh, that's right, I said it.  \n\nThis is not the go to place for authentic Mexican food, by now most people know this.  It's what many would call \""Americanized.\""  I had the enchiladas suiza.  One with cheese, one with spinach.  The flavors appealed to the \""fat American who likes cheese\"" in me.  The freezer burned spinach with crunchy leaf stems was not so pleasing however.  \n\nI wasn't overly offended by anything, because I went in here knowing it would be mediocre Americanized Mexican food complete with kitschy  decor.  \n\nBonuses of the night included well, not much, but hey, the waitress was hot."
4,"Great place to go, I love the night staff and the food is amazing. Great place to hang out after a long day"
4,"I went in today because all of my tires were low and I just didn't have the energy to fill them myself. When I got there, it was really busy and I was worried that the wait would be long. I had to wait about five minutes initially but was acknowledged by staff repeatedly so I didn't feel neglected. Jon walked right out to my car with me, explained quite a bit about how tires work and then immediately filled my tires. He was very kind and very informative. No charge to fill the tires and the education was free as well. I feel much more knowledgeable about my tires. These guys have always been pleasant and easy to deal with."
4,"Best in Vegas for AYCE and best in Vegas period if you go omakase. Ive been to SEN of Japan, Osaka (Henderson) which I will say are the only other excellent sushi restaurants in Vegas. Blue Fin is best value for your money and the chef is the most creative in town. Ask for something a little different he blow your mind! If you go anywhere else you are wasting your $$."
4,Ordered delivery through Yelp and was worried due to the previous complaints but within 40 mins there was a knock at the door. Chicken Philly is really good! I'll definitely be ordering delivery again
0,"Awful restaurant! This place USED TO BE AWESOME when it was Lolita's. The new-age Mexican food they offered was flavorful and every dish was a culinary experience. Since this place became Coconuts the food has turned to crap. Everything we tried was overcooked, under seasoned and swimming in tasteless sauce.  Tables were sticky and dirty, not tablecloths, and poor service given.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and do not come to eat here. It's a waste of time and money."
2,I had heard so much about Pizzeria Bianco and only thought the pizza was average.  It's a very small restaurant and the wait can be long.  I just don't get the hype.
2,"THIS PLACE IS SLAMMED ALL THE TIME! Never without a line, I'm currently addicted to the Sun Dried Tomato bagel and it's worth the wait, but it's good to note to never go here on a weekend if you're on a specific time frame. \n\nFresh bagels, with all the standards and a few surprises and good cream cheese - I am excited to try Poppy's soon but this will always be a great place in Cotswold to get some carb lobving :)"
3,"Based on the previous reviews I guess the hubby and I just got lucky :) I really enjoyed this place! Thought the decor was super funky and fun.  My meal was delicious, as was the hubbys.  Maybe our bodies were just starved for something that wasnt deep fried eaten at 5 a.m., who knows.  I ordered the carne asada tacos and my husband had the chicken burrito.  Everything tasted so fresh and yummy. Chips were very good, prices were good...I would definitely go here again."
1,"I've gone here off and on since the late 70's and never been quite so disappointed as my most recent 2 visits which makes me wonder, based upon other reviews, if our table might have been an exception. Most recently, the appetizers were mediocre at best with the wedge potatoes hard(burnt) and the spinach artichoke dip nearly runny. The steak(filet mignon) was kind of tough even though it was very pink inside(not overcooked). The only person in our party of 8 who was happy had a chicken dish that she said was very good. The bread was the only item all of us enjoyed. This isn't a place to take friends from out of town anymore unless you want to dis the metro area or aqre in a hurry to see the town lake after your meal. If people insist on coming here, have a sandwich, they are pretty tasty."
1,The food here was good but our waitress disappeared after we got our food. After waiting an extra 15 mins we decided that it must be free so we got up and left.
2,"This is one of the only bakeries near uptown that offered a savory bread loaf, so I gave Local Loaf a try. Pecorino Rosemary sounded perfect, but it was a bit disappointing. This bread did not taste that great straight out of the bag. However, once I doctored it up, it was very nice. After brushing with roasted garlic olive oil, oven toasting and sprinkling with salt and pepper, it made a great base for bruschetta and artisan cheeses. However, I would not spend $6-$7 again for a loaf of bread that needs this much work. \n\nBased on other yelp reviews, I will be back at least one more time to try their lunch sandwiches."
4,"A bit pricy, but truly a fantastic burger spot for a casual counter service place. I got the Texas burger which comes with a multitude of premium toppings like avocado, deep fried onion strings and gouda cheese.  I knew I was about to become a fan when the guy said I could have it cooked rare if I wanted. I opted for med rare and it came out perfectly cooked. We got a pound of sweet potato fries to share.\n\nA perfect accompaniment to the fries was a huge sauce counter with a dozen or so choices including some bizarre ones like toasted marshmallow and apple cider. I enjoyed the Chipotle mayo, Thai ketchup, and ragin' cajun. The apple was surprisingly good as well. Fries themselves were thinner than I prefer but decent enough. As for the burger,  outstanding! Easily the best I've had from a casual joint and rivaled the best from a high end restaurant. It's worth the 8 dollar price tag, but when you add $3 for 1 order of sweet potato fries and $2.19 for a drink, you're talking $14 per person with tax.  Another downside  is they don't have any grilled chicken sandwiches on the menu, which is basically all my mom orders at these places. They also have veggie, ground chicken and turkey patties if red meat isn't your thing. I tried a bite of my brother's chicken parm burger which was quite yummy.  But ground beef is the way to go if you ask me.\n\nOther than the price and somewhat limited options,  I can't really complain about anything. Will definitely make it back when I return to Charlotte."
0,"Went to lunch there today with some coworkers, I will NEVER go back. Had CJ as a waiter, he was absolutely horrible, what a total jerk. Some of my coworkers warned me about him and have had many negative experiences with him. Yeah, they weren't joking. \n\nI found hair in my food and asked for the same entree. He brought out another bowl of soup and told me to \""mind the breeze.\"" First, there wasn't a breeze. I told him yeah the hair didn't fly in my soup from the breeze, it was in the soup. He then said \""Are you sure?\"" He had a total attitude the entire time, he then stood over me while I looked at the bill pressuring me to pay it right away. He brought the bill back and picked up my wallet to move it and place the check down. I will never ever go back here thanks to CJ. \n\nThe food is pretty good, but even that isn't enough to have me chance another encounter with CJ. What a jackass."
1,Hhhhmmmm..it's OK...nothing special. I've had FAR better
1,"Yelp says 2 stars means \""Meh, I've experienced better\"", which is exactly how I felt about our dinner from here tonight.\n\nWe ordered two entrees, one egg roll, and an order of cheese wontons.  The person on the phone taking our order told us it would take 30 minutes for delivery and did not tell us the price.  We live less than 1.5 miles away and called early (not during the typical dinner-time rush) but the delivery took a bit longer than 30 minutes.  The total was $29.80 before tip, which seems a bit pricey.\n\nThe food was just mediocre.  The cheese wontons were okay but the cheese tasted just a bit off.  The tofu homestyle was bland and the sauce had an odd aftertaste.  The only vegetables were carrots, snow peas, and a few small pieces of bamboo, none of which were flavorful.  The Gold Sesame Chicken is described as having a \""sophisticated brown sauce\"", but really it was either General Tso's or sweet and sour sauce.  There were two tiny broccoli florets in the dish - did they fall in accidentally?\n\nI wanted to like it - it would be very convenient for me - but it was nothing impressive."
1,"Came in on a quiet Sunday night for my first time with some family.  Here's how the meals went...2 pasta dishes, both room temperature, 1 pear salad in which they forgot the pears, one fish and chips which was ok, and the best of all...a children's corn dog served STILL FROZEN!!!  Yep, the corn dog was still ice cold and frozen!  The server said something about problems in the kitchen (really?), but that doesn't help me.\n\nWe sent EVERYTHING back.  Second time around everything was better, but by then...\n\nThe server was good, and the manager gave us desserts for our aggravation, but I still don't think I'll be going back any time soon. It was a $90.00 meal that was not worth it all.  Rather than giving us desserts, the meals should have been comped, in hopes we would try again.  But I won't."
4,"I visited Cave and Ives on my hunt for the best burger in Phoenix.  It came in 1st place among 16 other restaurant burgers. Here's my review.\n\nWhen I tried the \""Cave and Ives\"" Burger, at Cave and Ives Portico Grill, I had a moment of astonished surprise. How was this secret kept from the world?! I had been to Cave and Ives before, and enjoyed some tasty food and delicious beer, but this is a perfect burger. The pretzel bun is flavorful, but still soft and not too aggressively \""pretzel-ed\"" that it steals the show. The patty is remarkably juicy, and has a terrific grilled flavor, enhanced by the smoky chipotle aioli. The saut\u00e9ed onions melt and give a nice sweet finish. The lettuce and tomato add crunch and freshness. I can't find any faults in this burger! When I think of what a good restaurant burger should be, this is what I think of, which is why it's my number one burger. Seriously, go and give it a try! I recommend pepper jack for your cheese selection.\n\nTo see the rest of the burger reviews and photos, check out http://forkvsfood.com/best-burger-review/"
0,"TI gets the earned \""Death 1 Star\"".  What a  formerly nice place ruined by the new owners. How is this Treasure Island at the Mirage?  Excuse me! No one moved the hotel.  It is Treasure Island. You know, the one that had the cute pirate show battle.  One of my favorites.  So, they take a successul show and replace it with Sirens?  One of the worst and dumbest shows on the Strip. Hey, TI guys/gals.  You been in the sun too long? \r\n\r\nThe Casino is dark and not particularly pleasant to be in.  Seems like heavy smoke all the time. Guess winning money is just as important as killing your customers with second hand smoke. Wow. You'd think Las Vegas is immune to second hand smoke (I know its not just TI, but some of the other properties seem to get fresh air in better).  \r\n\r\nFood at the coffe shop is mediocre at best, and the fabulous steak house was way overpriced and overblown.  Oh, and the really hip night club, called Tangerine (all the 100s of ads seem to indicate that is where all the hip guys and gals congregate) is a monument to stupidit.?  Somehow if you are a guest, you can bypass the $30 cover charge. I went in at 11pm just to see what's up.  All I saw was a few scantilly clad girl bartenders, and a bunch of big South Pacific burly men in tuxes. Guess it gets rough later on. What a joke. \r\n\r\nTI you suck!!\r\n\r\nps. The admin in my company that booked us here, one question:  \""What were you thinking?\""."
2,"(6/15/2013) Well its a Saturday night and the place is filling up with kids. I ordered another Hawaiian heart throb smoothie. My wife is having sweet tea. We ordered the chips & French onion dip & the full order of riblets off the $9 appetizer menu.\n\nFirst off the chips were cold even though some of them still had a lot of oil on them. The French onion dip tasted like a packet of French onion soup mix was dumped into some cream. Despite these problems we ate it all because the $9 riblets were worse. How much worse you may ask? Well for $9 you receive 8 riblets on a bed of the same chips that came with the dip. The eight riblets might have equaled three full size ribs. Like any ribs the riblets were 95% bone and 5% meat. The riblets were also barely warm & had almost no flavor or sauce. My wife said we would never order them again & I concurred.\n\nMy wife ordered chicken strips as her main meal. There were three strips altogether with french fries. I felt daring & ordered the Beserker Burger which was promoting some movie. I should've stuck to the regular menu. The Beserker came on a red platter with a hammered aluminum cup around the fries. The cup had no bottom so it had to be kept on the platter. Still its a step in the right direction...\n\nThe burger did not have a wrapper around it. It did have a useless wooden paddle speared through its center advertising the movie. When I tried picking up the burger to eat it, it fell apart. I had to eat it with a knife and fork. It had some special onion straws on it that tasted no differently than the onion straws found on any other burger.\n\nThe highlight of the burger was the spicy pickles. The pickles were crunchy & seasoned nicely.\n\nNow on to the service or lack of it from our server Stephanie. I can't think of a lot of excuses why she seemed to think that my smoothie would refill itself. And I can't forgive waiting 15 minutes for her to remember to put the drink order in with the bartender! Empty plates sat on the table waiting to be removed. She wasn't personable in any manner & made me wish that one of our regular servers had been working the bar that evening. What made it worse in my eyes was the fact that the burger was my birthday burger.\n\nI think we'll just go on weekday nights. The three stars are for the pickles and the smoothie only."
0,"I was hugely disappointed by the restaurant after going to it based on the reviews. The lady who runs it is charming, but the decor and food are both a disaster. The inside is crammed full of cheap knicknacks for sale (coffee mugs, tea towels, plate cozies). It smelled strongly of cleaning chemicals. The scone was not particularly good, and I'm fairly sure the whipped cream came from a store-bought can. Maybe it is better at breakfast? I don't see what was charming about the restaurant, except perhaps if the decor reminds you of your own gran's house and looks nicer in the warm glow of fond memories."
2,"South Point is off the main area of the strip but the rooms are big and clean and affordable. The food at the Coronado cafe is better than expected.  I would give them 3.5 stars if I could. \n\nThere is an attached equestrian arena and the parking smelled like the fair, but it was all good.  I didn't gamble here so I can't say much about that."
4,"Oh man.... prepare yourself for goodness!!\n\nI got a coupon from restaurant.com which is the only reason we found this gem. We were staying on the complete opposite end of the strip, so we are lucky to have made our way down here!\n\nDespite the $50 gift certificate, we had no illusions of a cheap meal. We had checked out their menu online and were prepared to pay. Which is a good thing!\n\nWe had a reservation on Friday night, and were promptly seated when we arrived. The wait staff was on it! While we had a main waitress, there were several others around who were quick to fill our wine glasses or remove an empty plate. \n\nIt didn't take long for us to order as we both new we were having steak. I ordered the Filet Mignon (medium rare) and my husband the New York strip (medium) with a lobster tail. We also ordered a side of Mac 'n Cheese and Spinach. \n\nBefore our meal, they brought out a sample of their duck fat fries. They were good, and we were presented with three varieties paired with a sauce. I'm not sure I would order them again, only because the rest of the food was amazing!\n\nOur steaks were cooked to perfection! Cut with a fork they were so tender! While the two sides were way too much for two of us, they were a great accompaniment. We savored every bite!\n\nWe also ordered a $90 bottle of wine. That is way more than we usually pay for wine (in fact, this whole meal was more than our biweekly food budget!), but it was awesome. Unfortunately we both drank too much of it to remember the name! Bottom line- just let them pick the wine. They won't disappoint!\n\nWhile it was not needed, we indulged in the marscapone cheesecake. WOW. A perfectly light end to a great meal!\n\nOur total bill was about $350. Typically I would have been struggling to breath at that price, but not this night. Maybe it was the wine that had relaxed me, but I woke up the next morning still feeling good about the money spent. \n\nExcellent food, great service, we'll be back in 5 years when we can afford it again!"
4,"I have to admit, I had my reservations about Poke Express as who would think that you could find good poke in the middle of the Las Vegas desert. In North Las Vegas of all places. But my dad did and because he was such a fan of Poke Express, I stopped in to try some in a way, to honor him. I'm glad I did - not just because my dad knew the owners there - but because they serve some really good freakin' poke. \n\nAnyway, the owners are uber nice and informative. I also appreciate, though I didn't really do it - how they offered up samples before I bought. Prices are in line with the cost of fish - and considering it has to be shipped in (remember the location) it's worth every penny. \n\nThere's a great variety of different flavors of tako and ahi. There were a few other items I didn't take notice of but I'll bet they'll be good, if it's what you like. I went with my usual limu poke and spicy ahi. I got a half pound of each. I had intended on eating a little bit of each as a lunch snack, but it was so fresh and tasty, that I ended up eating the entire pound for lunch, in pretty much one sitting. \n\nAnyway, over on Craig Road just east of MLK, on the south side in a strip mall - in North Las Vegas ... there's a place that serves up poke similar to what you'll find in Hawaii. My family lives nearby so it'll just be one more reason to visit ..."
3,"For some reason, I had a ridiculous craving for Chicago style deep dish pizza.  Like almost a physical urge to eat that thick, gooey, filling style of pie.  So we found ourselves braving the crowds (we went at 5pm and there was an hour wait!) because folks said Oregano's had good deep dish pizza.  \n\nFirst, can I talk about the menu?  What is this, a theme restaurant in Vegas?  The person who wrote this menu should be stoned (and probably was when he wrote it) for all the terrible, chintzy, schlocky, names and descriptions of food.  \n\nAnyway, they do a pretty decent job of managing the crowd and getting folks drinks while they wait in the large, open patio area, and a table opened up soon enough.  We started with a large, family style salad which was mostly lettuce.  Then the pizza came, and it was everything I hoped it would be.  Sure, it's not Giordano's, but it was seriously the next best thing.  It was thick and gooey and exactly what I was looking for.  We had the numero one-o (sigh...) and the amount of toppings, and the pounds and pounds of cheese hit the right spot.  The crust was a little tough to get through with the butter knife provided, but that's my only complaint about the pizza.  It was even good as a thick cheese brick the next day.\n\nSo I'm going to take a star off for the seriously embarrassing menu, and for the fact that you cannot come here and not wait for a table, and the mediocre salad.  But that deep dish pizza is the real deal, far away from Chicago."
4,"THE BEST BUFFET!!! The crab legs are already opened for you and they taste great!! They have 3 different types of sushi. They have spicy tuna (the best roll there), California roll (I think), and crab (eh, not my favorite). The sushi was pretty good I must say. \n\nSeafood LIke Meter: 98% \n\nThey have lamb there, it tasted delicious!! They also have squash. By the way, they have a variety of \""fancy\"" meats and squash on swords. You should definitely check that section out!\n\nFood on A Sword Score: 10000000%\n\nOmg, the deserts are like your swimming in a pool of hot fudge chocolate with cotton candy trees and chocolate bunnies surrounding you!! They have like 100 different cupcakes. I recommend getting the s'mores, THAT is the best cupcake I've eaten in my life!! They also have ice cream. Chocolate and Vanilla. And they have cotton candy! Yummy!\n\nDesert Score: 100000000%\n\nOverall, The Spice Market Buffet is the perfect buffet for anyone who has a big appetite. You are going to have to check this out yourself to see if you like it! I am FOR SURE coming back here!\n\nOh I almost forgot $20 bucks a person... It's worth it! :)"
0,"I don't know why I keep running into bad luck with pizza shops in Pittsburgh, but it's really disheartening.  Pizza Romano usually has a decent veggie sub that I order when my husband is craving wings and pizza.  Apparently though, this time that we ordered, they failed to tell us that their menu had changed.  Instead of a medley of vegetables, they gave me goopy \""eggplant\"", soggy tomato, cheese, and some type of liquid that had made bread into soup.  I wouldn't even attempt to eat it.  I called and THEN they notified me of the change.  No big deal... but their new menu stated that there should be eggplant, tomato, zuchinni, and mushrooms on it.  I saw no mushrooms or zuchinni. Also their garlic bread was weak and disgusting and tiny.  Not worth it.  I am really disappointed with our experience. Needless to say, we won't be ordering from there again.  I just hope we can find a restaurant that can provide quality when we're craving some delivery."
3,"I've been making an annual trip to Vegas for about the past 20 years (I keep trying to figure out what it is that \""happens in Vegas\""...so far, no idea :-).  I have been thru the Luxor previously, and had even briefly (uh-hum) seen the inside of one of their Pyramid Rooms until last week, when I actually stayed in one.  I will say that the rooms are \""cool\"", with their sloping windows, huge atrium (that you walked across to get to/from the \""inclinators\"" which are now just called \""elevators\"").  My room had a view over the pool area, a comfortable bed, an older style wall a/c unit that kept my room comfortable, and a shower but no bathtub.  The shower was nice and big, but the bottles of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel kept sliding off the soap dish onto the floor, so I ended up just leaving them on the floor!\n\nAll in all, I was satisfied with my room, even without a refridgerator in it!  However, in the morning, I was awaked to the sound of hammering and sawing taking place, apparently a couple of floors above the room I was staying in (on the 13th floor).  The construction noise persisted, so I called the front desk who were very accommodating and arranged for me to move to one of their tower rooms.  The tower room was great, had an awesome view of the Excaliber Hotel next door (I felt like I was living in a fairytale)!  I really liked how the Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay to the South, and to Excaliber to the North, with moving walkways and various shops/restaurants/bars all along the way.  I got plenty of cardio in, and got to sample some alcohol at Minus 5, and some Krispy Kreme doughnuts an the food court area of Excalibur.  What shocked me the most was seeing the lines of people at McDonalds (in the Luxor & Excalibur)!  Really people, you go to Vegas and line up to eat at McDonalds???\n\nAnyway, the Luxor is a cool hotel, true it's not the newest hotel on the strip, but they are renovating the rooms in the Pyramid, and my room in the West Tower was great.  Only odd thing, the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub (which I was excited to try out), but I discovered that the hotel had disabled all of the jacuzzi tubs in the resort.  Nobody would tell me why, I'm guessing the reason might be \""shocking\""!"
4,"The last time I was here Bosa 1 was just recouperating from the fire damage and it was good then.  Revisited the establishment recently and the food tasted even better.  \n\nWe came here for one thing and that was the Cha Gio Eggrolls.  Don't get me wrong though, the other dishes are excellent as well.  But those egg rolls are addictive.  The GF and I don't even share lol, we each get our own.  Just thinking about it is making me want to go there now.\n\nWith the awsome egg rolls aside, they offer a series of combination dishes that are all great.  When looking at the menu it seems that you can choose from a variety of different combinations of dishes and each section caters to how hungry you are.  And the server can tell you about all of them.\n\nOn top of all this good food they have some ecellent beverages.  This time there was a soda with macerated strawberries.  It was great.  \n\nThis is a cash only establishment and in my opinion that is cool."
2,"Came here for a work lunch. Looks very swank when you walk in, but due to the really high ceilings, the place is really loud even when it's not packed. They have a pretty nice terrasse as well, but it was far too cold to even attempt to eat out there.\n\nThere are quite a few wines by the glass which is nice, but the beer selection certainly wasn't the best. Lunch was pretty good, but nothing too special and the price tag was pretty high, even by Outremont standards (tiny appy and then fish & chips: 20$)\n\nI'd come again, but next time I would go for the mussels I think as they looked a lot better than my very fried fish et frites."
0,Awful. Don't go. Horrible service. The chicken is sinewy or rubbery depending on the dish. Sometimes it's invisible. Worst Asian food I've ever had.
2,"This is the first pizza place I went to the day we moved into town.  It was decent.  Their wings are great!  The garlic bread with cheese is huge and delicious.  Drink are just fine.  Overall, seems like a solid place to go watch a game or have a beer and pizza.. or wings!"
0,"This place is gross! First off the rooms smell, the towels smell and the carpet is filthy! One of my pillows was dirty and there was a hair on the comforter. It feels more like a truck stop then a hotel in Scottsdale. Couldn't wait to leave! \n\nI don't understand these other reviews, makes me think there fake!"
1,"I missed getting there in time for lunch & was so hungry as I had not eaten all day that I decided to try the Dinner Buffet. I basically ended up paying double ($15) for what they typically had served for lunch.\n\n I wasnt very impressed.\n\n First off, the lighting was deplorable and made it near impossible to read the USA Today I bought from the gift shop. It was this \""dim beige\"" hue and didnt go well even if I had not had the paper.\n\nSecondly, the quality of the selections wasnt good at all. The Lo-Mein noodles had a texture of badly cooked ramen noodles (I say \""RAY-Men Noodles not \""Raa-men). Several of the other items seemed to follow in this manner such as the Steamed Green Beans, Hawiian Pulled pork, Collard Greens, etc...Overall the items lacked any \""kick\"" and came off as bland to me.Also there was no sushi which was a disappointment :(\n\nOn the good side, the BBQ ribs, while fatty, were very good as was the Blackened Pork Chops (I had 2 big ones so I guess so!!).The Chinese Pepper Steak was just OK and again lacked the kick of spices added to it. I didnt try any of the Mexican or Italian offerings but they DID look appealing to the eye.\n\nThe HIGHLIGHT of it all has to go to the COCONUT CREAM PIE!! It was good and how I managed to have only 1 slice was a testament to my self control. While it could have been colder than the room temperature it was, it was still VERY good and I had some soft serve Vanilla Ice cream beside it with mini M&M's, nuts & other toppings.\n\nWhile I would not go back for Dinner again, I probably will go back to see how the lunch is just to give them another chance, as well as try the Seafood Night.\n\n In closing, I might add that the waitstaff was very nice and efficient and the wait in line at opening was a moderate 7 minutes and thinned out to \""No Waiting\"" within a half hour of being there. Also, despite the lighting the place was a very nice, open and comfortable setting."
2,"If you are a traveler and working in the west valley, it is late and you don't want to commute then try this place out.  Phoenix is interesting when eating mexican.  You tend to get more of the Sonoran influence which is basically american mexican food which tends to be heavy with sour cream and yellow cheeses.  \n\nThis place used to be an ichi ban and you will notice the left over teppan tables as you walk in.  The food is good they have a good assortment of your usual enchiladas and burritos. \n\nThey have plenty of beer selections and some margaritas. The service was very good and that will definitely suffice for the three stars."
4,"First-rate dining experience from top-to-bottom. \n\nMy wife and I both tried the four course tasting menu with wine pairings -- every course was spectacular and the wine pairings matched perfectly.  Even the bread (bacon rolls and baguettes) was awesome.\n\nHighlights of the meal:\n-- Heirloom baby beets -- the whipped Harbison cheese was to die for.\n\n-- Grilled spanish octopus -- I'm not one to normally like octopus, but the combo with the charred pumpkin and whatever other spices they had rocking  made me forget I was eating one of the sea's strangest looking creatures.\n\n-- Beef belly braised for 48 hours -- the meat was fatty and very, very tender (almost melted in your mouth).\n\nA price of $89 pp for the four courses and $44 for the wine pairings was definitely a steal by Vegas standards for the quality of food and wine we enjoyed.\n\nThe wait staff was great. The timing of the whole meal was spot-on -- we never felt rushed (in contrast to other nice Vegas restaurants, it would seem) but didn't have to wait long between courses, either. Our waiter was great about answering any questions and took some extra time to talk about each of the wines as there were a few we had never had before or really heard of.\n\nOverall, this was the best dinner we had during our Vegas trip.  We'll definitely be back."
4,"I always get the chicken burrito with veggies, black beans, and everything else on it. Service has always been great when I go in. One of my favorite eating spots"
3,"Pink Pepper is definitely a favorite place of mine to order from that's around the house.  From mouth-watering curry to crispy Thai toast, Pink Pepper has always hit the spot when it comes to a spice-craving.  I've never actually dined in, I always place my orders to-go, but the ambiance is quite nice.   Portions could be bigger but the quality usually makes up for the average prices and smaller portions.  They make a mean yellow curry!"
4,"Need shoe repair, Eastern and Tropicana on the South East section of the intersection.  The shop faces west, tis on the south end of the building, in the second row of shops from Eastern Ave.\n\nShoes, and other leather products.  I had them repair a Coach backpack style purse for a friend, after Coach returned the item saying it could not be repaired... \n\nOwner repair man is a very friendly person, with an amazing amount of knowledge in leather goods construction...  They also have quality leather wallets, and money folds.  If they do not have the shoe lace you need, it is no longer available...\n\nUpdate March 2013:  They also can fix/repair Bicycle Shoes.  I have a pair of Cannondale branded  Diadora Road Bike shoes, that began to scratch my toes raw.  On a whim I took the shoes to B & L..  \n\nThe counter person opened the shoe and explained they had used a heavy pasteboard to build the toe box, something done by numerous sport shoe manufactures to reduce the construction cost.  \n\nHe indicated it could be repaired by adding a leather cap to the front toe area.  Several days later I was in the pedals with these repaired cycling shoes enjoying a 40 mile ride, and all the discomfort was gone.  \n\nFrom a Stylish Coach Bag, solid Leather Shoes, or your Expensive Branded Sports Shoes, this is a location to have your leather goods checked before tossing them in the dustbin.  Might save you more than a few dollars, or the time breaking in a new pair of leather shoes.\n\nJR"
2,"Having waited nearly two years to try Church Brew Works, I was sorely disappointed by the food and beer, but overwhelmed by the atmosphere. There's really no comparing the atmosphere to anything else - it's in an old church, of course, and the high ceilings and stained glass windows are overwhelming. Unfortunately, my burger was subpar, and I've never really enjoyed any of CBW's beer - the fact that it was on tap from the brewery didn't help. Furthermore, my waiter was incredibly odd - lame jokes, and all, which detracted a bit from the experience."
1,"Just ate there for lunch today and it was... decent. The Cod was pretty good, but the fries were awful. I had better Fish & Chips at TGI Friday's last week. Truth."
0,"This place is aweful! The bathrooms are so tiny!  The shower is gross, and there is literally no room to move in there. There was no hot water for hours in the morning. Would never stay there again.  If I could put 0 stars I would."
3,"I ended up staying here after my pet sitting arrangements fell through and I had to end up bringing my dogs with while my wife was attending a convention.\nIf you are traveling to Vegas and bringing your dog(s) (which I don't recommend, it just worked out that way this time)...this is the place to stay.\nVery friendly front desk staff. Reasonable rates...free wifi & I don't think they charge a resort fee. They allow dogs...no size restriction!\nThe room was pretty basic, but, it was fine this trip. There was not a lot of noise either. Easy access to the strip and an easy drive to the convention center."
3,"I really enjoy coming to LIGHT in Mandalay Bay! Everytime I come I can feel that AC! hahaha HATE when clubs are cheap and  do not turn the AC on. The stage where the Dj plays is awesome with the back drop of screens from the floor to the ceiling makes it a sight to see! They dont call this club LIGHT without the crazy light shows! haha \n\nIts two stories and the club is long (width) wise. The only thing I hate is that upon letting people in they will take you either upstairs or downstairs and block the opposite floor till it gets busier and than they will open all floors. So retarded! \n\nIts a fun club, a lot of good looking people and the long bars on both floors. One of my favorite clubs to go to in Vegas!"
1,"Why so stingy with the chips and salsa?  If you don't ask for chips and salsa, they don't offer them  Weird.  Also, to the waitress who picked up my wine glass before I finished my wine...your tip was reduced.  A good server will know not to do that.  Also, the music is way too loud for a small restaurant."
1,I walked in Bebe nails just expecting a quick manicure maybe a short wait.  After waiting 30 minutes with no one acknowledging me another person walks in and is greeted right away. The person wanted the same thing as me a manicure. They sat them down in a chair an immediately got to work. At that point I was so pissed I just got up and walked out. Thanks for nothing bebe nails.
0,"Had their buffet 2 years ago. Tables were greasy, floors were dirty. And I distinctly remember the discolored salmon that had the strangest texture.\n\nI got food poisoning afterward, and haven't been back to see if things have improved. Unless their management has changed since then, I will not go back.\n\nI would go to these other buffets over China Town Buffet anyday - Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler, Hong Kong Gourmet in Ahwatukee, and Crazy Buffet in Tempe."
1,"Alright so I've only ever been here when I've been hungover. But let me tell you, the shitty $1.99 bottomless coffee, hash browns, and omelet stuffed with all sorts of processed cheese and meat...IS THE BEST HANGOVER CURE EVER.  \n\nThe place is like Denny's.  Big whoop.  Everyone there seems a little depressed....customers, staff, everyone.  But hey, with that type of environment going in your sweatpants and with a hangover...you fit right in."
0,"I came to this \""new club\"" expecting great things. I was greatly disappointed with their staff treatment. The line to get in was an hour wait for guest list, the staff didn't know much information and was talking to the guests rudely. I actually got punched in the face by accident by a staff member and ignored it and kept moving, I got pulled aside and yelled at by the staff that \""hit me accidentally\"" I was appalled by his statement of me running into his hand and kept moving not wanting any drama and wanting to leave as soon as possible.  I would not recommend this club to anyone, Marquee is still the best club I've been to in Vegas. Don't waste your time with Hakkasan. If I could give this place zero stars I would."
4,"Yes! Love this place. I understand the service may not be the best, but if you become a regular they seem to loosen up :) I love the peanut sauce here. I could bathe in it! Every dish we have ordered so far has been great. The best part, if you want your food spiced \""hot\"" they actually make it hot! Every other Thai restaurant I've been to in Charlotte won't spice my food over mild, even when I ask for extra hot. I try to go here every Thai \""Thursday\"" :)"
0,"Omg this place is a NO GO! I repeat NO GO! I usually yelp places before I go and this one time I went without checking I totally messed up. People here won't do a job! ....rush rush rush to get to the next fool to pay them 25 bucks for a pedicure. They didn't take the cuticles cleaned up, soaked my feet and put the polish on my toes which was smeared all over. It looked like a 2 year old putting lipstick for fun. Omg! Awful, the guy and the chick here had major attitude. They try to fix wrong with another wrong... The heck bro! So I had to stop it. No Polish walked out.. Still paid them 25 bucks they might need it to go back to school to be a nail tech or manicurist. Ouch! Bam!"
3,"Yummy  I love ph, and I've been to many a Vietnamese restaurant looking for ph. This place has wonderful ph, especially for Arizona. I love their broken rice dishes as well; the eggs and the pork are delicious."
2,"The food is really good! It's definitely better than a lot of the Thai restaurants I've been to lately. What they lost the 2 stars on is customer service and being cheap. By cheap, I don't mean prices. They gave us each a tiny bowl of rice...and charged us for more. I've never had any other places charge for more rice. Now onto service; we were the only ones in there and after we ran out of rice, we waited about a solid 20 minutes for anyone to ask if everything was ok and if  we needed anything else. \n\nOther than that, the food is delish!"
3,"First visit we ended up leaving because what was supposed to be a 10 minute wait turned into a 30 minute wait and we had a show to get to....but I'm SO glad we went back another time.\n\nFood portions are HUGE so don't be shy about sharing a meal or even just an appetizer cuz DAH-YUM you get a lot of food. Love the drinks in mason jars too. Now that's the right way to drink sweet tea!\n\nAnd the food was excellent. In fact, the biscuits and apple butter could easily be dessert...or a meal on their own. WOW. Super yum! \n\nOur server Bethany was terrific. She kept our drinks full, was very personable, and had great suggestions without being intrusive. I will definitely be back--and am looking forward to those biscuits and apple butter very soon!"
2,"I was in the same Co. as Kate S, previous. Although, I decided to skip the greasy pizza and get... wait for it... a greasy meatball sandveech! \""Meatball Hero\"" I believe it was called... Not bad. The meatballs were nothing special. Gradually losing my appetite, I just dumped those and ate the cheesy & saucy bread."
1,"When I was first seated, I was told that the daily special was either Chicken or Tuna Salad. I got really excited because Chicken salad was just what I was craving.  When the waitress came back, I went to order the Chicken salad and she told me that they did not serve Chicken salad nor have they ever served it.  I was confused and disappointed so I ordered the Tuna salad instead.  It was rather bland and unsatisfying.  The nice outdoor seating was the only redeeming aspect of my experience there that day."
1,"All the Stussy goods you could ask for, with customer service comparable to the workers at Supreme NY. Don't expect to receive a head nod or \""what's up\"" when you walk in the door. Gave my cousin a hard time, unfold a shirt and they'll be following you around the store until you walk out. They're too busy admiring their fixed gear bikes and looking like their busy on their Macs."
4,"My husband and I have been absolutely thrilled with the service we've received from Tiffany and Sapphire Accounting. We are both small business owners, and have our share of random tax and small business questions. Tiffany consistently goes the extra mile in helping sort out any details and answering any questions that we have. I truly feel like she has a dedicated interest in our business. When we first were referred to her, I had a stack of questions and a box of receipts and miscellaneous paperwork, and a huge headache and anxiety around filing our business taxes. She helped me to get a handle on our taxes and make adjustments for the future. Tiffany is incredibly knowledgable, kind, organized, and thorough: all of the qualities you need in an accountant. Aside from accounting questions, she also has a wealth of information and resources for small business owners. I cannot recommend Sapphire Bookkeeping and Accounting enough. They have helped with our personal and business taxes, and have truly been a godsend. I refer them to every small business owner I know! Please give them a call- I promise you won't regret it!"
4,"When i'm in need of major color, I always come here and get the dark in a day. 50 moolah and you can get 3-4 shades than what you came in with. it consists of level 5 tanning bed and mystic tan."
3,"They tend to have a great selection of conventionally grown produce (and, no, it's not really a farmer's market.. I wish!).  Their organic produce selection has grown in the past 5 years that I've been shopping here, so I think they'll only grow more with time.  They now at least have a section dedicated to O produce so you don't have to hunt around for it.\n\nOn Wednesdays, they have double-dip days.. meaning that the previous week's ads and the upcoming week's ads are active on the same day - double the deals!\n\nTheir meat section is decent - they always carry Organic beef and Organic chicken, and they have Lamb usually and Bison on occasion.  Of course conventional pork, beef, chicken, etc are always there. \n\nI would have to say the biggest pluses to this place are their bulk items - everything form choc chips to almond flour.. trail mixes... legumes... all kinds of nuts.. baking flours and even alternative snacks (apricots, dried currants, etc).  The other plus is the Vitamin section - TONS and TONS of options for all kinds of supplements, herbs, vitamins, whatever.. it's a great place to get cosmetics, too as they carry all the Alba, Avalon, Burts, Toms, etc.\n\nOccasionally they have the 25% off days for anything in the VItamins/Supplements area or from the Bulk section..  I go crazy up in this place stocking up!\n\nTheir wine selection is actually very nice for a grocery their size.  They tend to carry small batch vineyards at times and that's nice to grab on occasion.\n."
4,"Only a few things matter to me in a hotel while on business trips;\n\n1. Bed\n2. TV\n3. Bathroom\n4. General Space\n\nThis Hyatt nailed them all. The bed was nice, the TV was huge, the bathroom was pretty good, and the room was basically a suite. I had a very comfortable stay there and would definitely go back the next time I'm conned into going to Charlotte."
1,This place serves extremely oily appetizers that are extremely salty. Not a fan. They have ipad menus for self ordering which is becoming a standard at all you can eat sushi places these days.
3,"You could not ask for a more non-descript exterior for a restaurant.  It is more than plain, it is nearly non-existent.  But the food, goodness gracious, the food is huge.\n\nWe ordered the \""Hungry Man\"" breakfast and split it.  Well, we could have taken the entire family and fed them all on these portions!  Two huge pancakes, two eggs, some of the best sausage I have had in Arizona--not those dehydrated, tiny little links, but moist, yummy sausage links.  The ham was enough for a ham and eggs breakfast--we both had some and there was some left over!   Two slices of bacon, country potatoes and toast.  Wow.  \n\nBreakfast was a bit slow in coming out, so they brought us a poppyseed roll--made on premises.  This woman can bake!  Yummmmy.....\n\nNow, the place is new and having a few hiccups.  There was no tea, and they ran out of sourdough bread for the toast.  But our waiter (son of the owners) was gracious in his explanations, and took great care of us.  They will get their ordering system down, and the orders will flow more smoothly.  For a few months being open though, I was amazed at the  job they did!   \n\nAwesome!  It's great to support a small family business, even better when the product is awesome.  May this be the first of many wonderful yelp reviews!"
2,"On 10/29/14 I visited Gilley's located within Treasure Island Hotel and Casino.  It was Karaoke night.  What fun and the place made me laugh.  I did not eat BBQ, but I watched as people sang their hearts out.  Many were awful, but one or two had talent!  There was not many on the dance floor this evening.  The DJ was good."
3,"After attending a meeting tonight nine of us went to the Golden Dragon for dinner. They serve  \""American Chinese food\"". Everyone got something different and everyone agreed the food here was outstanding. \n\nHere is my take on this place....I always start my meal with the soup. If the soup is  is good usually the food is good as well. Tonight was no exception. The Wor Wonton soup was excellent!   In addition to my soup I got a vegetable dish. The sauce on it was superb. \n\nEveryone commented how their entr\u00e9e had good flavors, was served hot and the ingredients used seemed fresh. No one was disappointed with what they got.     prepared perfectly. The food here is great and while it isn't 100% authentic it's very filling, not expensive, had large portions, was served fast and every dish was delicious. I can't emphasize enough how inexpensive it is! \n\n\n************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \n4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. \n3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go. \n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!"
3,"Great Hotel if you decide to bring your kids to Vegas on Summer.\nI agree - bad ventilation in bath room\nI agree - crowded pool\nBut, will I be staying there again? Big \""YES\"" \nFamily oriented hotel which you can hardly find in Vegas. Many great things overcome small negative impact.\nHere is my good advice,,, \nDon't go to shark reef...it's nothing\nWatch Lion King... at $53 seat\nGo to the beach in the morning"
2,"The first thing I noticed when I walked in is that the building is very well designed. So for architecture I give Z Tejas a strong grade. \n\nI'll be honest, I wasn't that excited to see this addition to the neighborhood. The Richardson's/Rokerji/Dick's Hideaway people do Southwest food about as well as it can be done and all are within an easy walk of Z. Neighborhood bar? I'll take any number of places including the Garage across the street. I'm just not sure where Z Tejas fits. \n\nThe food is exactly what you would expect, pretty good, not great. If you have friends in town from rural Washington/Nebraska/Minnesota, this will be exotic and outside their comfort zone from a flavor standpoint. Arizona people might think a little... Meh. I do like that they section out their menu to show the vegetarian listings, always a positive to make things easier on the diners. \n\nThe southwest slaw (I think that's what it's called) was one of the worst things I've ever had. It tastes like somebody took cole slaw and added all the black pepper they could find. I like pepper so I can only assume this was a mistake or designed for a consumer that has almost no sense of taste."
0,"So, we stopped in for the breakfast buffet this morning before heading out for the day.   Totally disappointed.  Since I had dinner here last night,  I am positive that they put the left overs from last night out today for brunch.  It wasn't even hidden well.  The food looked old and dried out.  We got there right before they started putting the lunch items out, so I could tell right away. \n\nI am not sure what happened to this place, because it used to be good.  Maybe they have a head chef now that just doesn't care, or maybe the management is cutting corners to try to save some money.  Either way, save your money and go somewhere else."
2,"My friends and I loaded up on some party supplies from here.  Snacks and alcohol.  We also bought some pressurized can of freon.  My friend's car would not take this can.  Not sure why either.  Her A/C might be broken!!  The drive around after the A/C failed sucked big time.  \n\nAnyway, I love how everything here is decently priced or cheap.  Can't live without one!  Quality sucks though for some things..."
2,Food is tasty and the drinks are outstanding. Try the prickly pear margarita. Service is generally poor and keeps me from becoming more of a regular.
1,"I thought I was going to be in love after seeing this show on Man vs. Food, but I was so disappointed.  \n1) The Sage Chicken Benedict was featured on Man vs Food but the chicken was dry, the biscuit was cold and the sauce was also luke warm.  The flavor of the cream sauce was tasty, but overall-meh.\n2) Their kids choco-chip pancake was the best thing we ate.\n3) Waffles were tough, so tough you needed a knife to cut through it.  \n4) Their Corned Beef Hash was not very flavorful and cheese made the presentation pretty ugly.\n\nI don't think I'll return, especially since the bill was $70 for breakfast.  The restaurant was empty, yet they wouldn't seat our party because 3 people were missing.  The hostess staff was not friendly at all, they made me feel like I had inconvenienced them.  Then we asked for hot chocolate, but the machine was broken.  A few minutes later, they must have fixed it, because other tables had hot chocolate, but our server wasn't aware enough to offer it to us once they could make them again."
3,"I was in a Thai mood and Siam Garden is near the Walmart I was headed to so I decided to give it a try.  It's kind of off the beaten bath.  The restaurant is in a strip mall in a business park off Arrowwood just past 485.  The place wasn't busy, just a couple of tables when I stopped in.  The decor was pretty typical for an asian restaurant.  It looked clean and well maintained.  When ever I have Thai food I pretty much always order Pad Thai, which is what I did today.  My meal came with soup and a fried spring roll.  The soup was interesting with chunks of pineaple in it along with some ground meat. (beef?)  Whatever it was the broth was light and tasted good.  My main dish came out pretty quickly after I finished my soup.  The spring roll was kind of small, but it really was just an added bonus as I didn't expect to get it.  The Pad Thai was tasty and hot.  I'm not much of an expert on Thai food, but like art, I know what I like and this was pretty good.  I'm pretty sure the person serving me was the owner of the restaurant.  My service was OK, but it seemed like she was more interested in the regulars at the other tables.  She did chat with me a bit when she brought my check though.  The price was very reasonable at $7.95 for my lunch.   I would recommend giving this place a try."
2,I ate here summer of 13 and for a date meal it was a great dining experience that you have to try when visiting the city.  Petite portions are well made and very tasty.  They don't slap a bunch of sauces on their dishes. .typical french Canadian fare which is perfect.
0,"If you want to buy a car from the shadiest dealer in the state, by all means, World Motors is your place.  We purchased a car that we were assured was in mint condition.  When we showed up to pick up the car, it had thousands of miles more than advertised.  Thousands!  \""It's never been in a wreck!\"" they claimed.  Later that night, it was brought to my attention that the navigation system did not work at all.  By the time we got it home, one state away, the paint on the back bumper was starting to chip.  Within the month, without any physical damage from our end, 1/3 of all the paint on the rear bumper had chipped off.  This is a luxury high end car they claimed to sell us! The body shop we took the car to up here said that the only reason for this was because the car had been in a wreck, and the bumper had been recently (and poorly) repainted.  When contacted, the owners basically told us that because it had been past 15 days, they would not do a thing.  I've never met more crooked people in my life.  Save your money and go elsewhere.  Don't let them rob you like they did us."
3,Ordered delivery and it got here really fast. Within 15-20 minutes.\n\nGot the pork fried rice and it was pretty good. Generous portions and reasonable prices.
0,"Called to see if they could replace the air filter in my car, gave them the info for my car and they told me that they could do it. Well, when I get there they had to look up what kind of filter it needed and then took 10 minutes trying to find it. They then quoted a price. I looked at the filter and immediately knew it was the wrong one. I told them as much, and they looked at me dumbfounded and asked what I meant. So I opened the hood and showed them, they told me they had never seen that kind of filter setup. Then told me it had to be aftermarket and only the dealership would be able to do it. My car is factory standard everything. No bells, no whistles. Turned out they were looking at the wrong engine type when they looked it up. I thought that these guys were mechanics... Kinda shocking that they don't know their way around a car."
3,"I'm actually taking off 1 star for all the anti-Obama stickers they had by the register. Sadly I do realize we have to put up with the uneducated from time to time but that was a bit much. \n\nOk, on to the food. This was the first time I have been to Capt Bills and did not have any idea of what to expect. I did check out the reviews on Yelp and they looked pretty good. I have driving by this place for years  and never stopped in so I figured why not. \n   When I first walked in I liked the look of the place. Lots of wood and it felt like an old school joint. I walked up to order and was greeted by a rather attractive young lady and thats always a good way to start things. I ordered the 10 inch Italian and 2 10 inch pastrami subs. Price was not to bad overall. The Italian sub is dirt damn cheap for what you get. I did order to go so I picked it up and went on home to try out this new (to me) place. \n   I took a bite of the Italian first and was amazed at how good it was. Lots of flavor with a nice fresh taste. Excellent bread with good cheese. This is a winner in my book. I will be back for the Italian. \n    I then reached over and took a bite of the pastrami and again was shocked at how good it was. This is not the type of pastrami you find at places like Chompies but a bit more like lunch meat. It was however very good with no gristle at all. Great flavor and very good cheese. Another winner for me. I am now starting to think about trying more and more of what Capt Bills has to offer. \n    All in all Capt Bills gets high marks for the food but a big negative for the political B.S. on the walls. I will be back for the food but I will never start a chat about politics in this place."
3,"My husband and I love Indo-Chinese food.  I am a vegetarian and he is not.  This place had a lot of veggie options, so it definitely gets a star added for that.  The service was great, too.  We had General Tso's tofu and Vegetable Manchurian with sauce, both medium spicy.  And it was perfectly medium spicy to us.  We both enjoyed the tofu the best.  Very good flavor and the tofu was well prepared.  And it's not that we didn't like the vegetable manchurian; it was good too...we just have a favorite at a place in NJ and so we compare everything to that.  The next time we are craving Indo-Chinese cuisine, we will pay a visit to Fu Lin."
1,I've stopped by here once after I got done grocery shopping. I read the reviews and anxiously wanted to give it a try. I ordered the Casella's Italian Sub and for some reason it did not live up to what I have read in all the other reviews. Maybe Casella's was having an off day. \n\nI am not marking it off from my list yet. I guess i will give Casella's another try. Hopefully it won't disappoint.
0,"My daughter and I went there together.  A few week before, I got quoted a price. So we decided to try this place.  I got Venoria.  Wonderful lady.  She did an awesome job.  I paid exactily what was quoted.  On the other hand, my daughter had this other lady.  She is the second stall from the entrance.  She was rough with my daughter.  My daughter didn't like the service she was getting.  My daughter said that she would rather go to another place, because this lady keep pulling her hair.  In the end, I end up paying $145.  When I was only quoted $65.  It was just a retouch of her peek a boo.  I told her about it, and she said that well, her hair is long.  I said I got a quote and you folks wrote it on paper.  I will never go and see her again.  I was so furious, I forgot her name.  But if you do go there she uses the 2nd booth from the entrance.  I will stick with Venoria.  she did a wonderful job and she even gives suggestions on my hair..  For future, I will only see venoria for me and my daughter."
2,"My husband and I stopped here last night before a movie at the Harris Theatre.  We sat in the bar, and got good service--although we were one of two parties when we arrived.  We each had a glass of wine and shared some risotto (amazing!) and some pizza (just ok).  It's been commented on before, but the portion sizes are quite small for the price here--I get that it's not the Golden Corral, but I didn't feel satisfied when we left, and that rarely happens even when I'm just eating \""bar food.\""\n\nI would probably come back for drinks (they have a decent wine list too), but not for a full meal, especially with so many other great options in the same area."
4,"I love this chipotle. Very generous on meat unlike metro location! Not to be rude but, everyone speaks good English too. I get very upset trying to explain how I want my burrito at the metro location and its never right and they don't understand. Always fast. I always have the same lady when I pick up. She always writes my husbands and is name on the bag with hearts. She's very kind. I love this location."
2,"As New York New York is my favorite casino on the strip I've been through here many times, and walked past their dry age coolers many times drooling. This past trip my brother and I finally broke down and decided to give this place a try. This might be because we'd really built up our expectations, but the end feeling we were both left with was, \""Huh - well that was good, but really nothing special.\""\n\nWe were seated promptly upon arrival and greeted by a very friendly and helpful waitress. She introduced us to the menu, talked about their different cuts, and took drink orders. While sipping on our manhattans, we placed our meal orders, both ordering the same thing - clam chowder, their signature NY strip, and the garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nThe clam chowder was spectacular. Thick, creamy, chunky. The mashed potatoes were good, but a bit too whipped for my liking. The steak - the signature wet and dry aged steak - was, well, tough and not all that flavorful. The waitress did recommend the ribeye (saying it was her favorite), and hindsight being what it is I'm thinking we should have listened to her.\n\nThere are many better places in Vegas than this one, including one of my favorites (Mon Ami Gabi). The place is decent, but for the price you can do much better elsewhere."
0,"This is by far the worst restaurant experience that I have ever encountered so far. I've driven by Sevens' plenty of times before they opened, looked them up online and was excited to try them out. Their menu looked really good and tasty. I finally got around to having dinner there this past weekend. The menu you see on their website for lunch & dinner is not what you'll see when you go in. Online, they combine both their lunch and dinner menus making it appear larger. But when we were there on a Friday night around 7, we were only given the dinner menu which was about half the size. Now that I'm looking at their menu online, the prices are also not accurate. It's probably because they're showing the lunch prices which are typically lower.\n\nWhen we arrived, it was dead. There were a few people at the bar and two other tables. We were seated inside the restaurant close to the patio. They had the patio doors open making it way too cold. Some heat lamps were definitely needed. Good thing I wore a leather jacket. The restaurant is really well decorated, clean, and modern. I didn't see what it used to look like as Avalon so I don't know how much they remodeled. We were greeted and seated right away.\n\nWe got the monkey bread and spinach and artichoke dip to start for 5 of us. The monkey bread was raw. At first we thought it was gooey cheese, no it was raw dough. Bleh! We told the waiter and he took it away and later brought us out a new one. The new one was clearly burnt. I didn't even bother trying it. The small piece of the first one I had was okay. Tasted similar to Red Lobster's cheesey biscuits with some honey. I thought it was supposed to have garlic butter? The spinach and artichoke dip came out on a huge plate. However, there were probably 8 wedges of pita to go with it. The dip was edible but way too garlicy. There needs to be more pita for the proportion of dip though. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the duck sliders to split and the lemon basil chicken. Other people got burgers, duck sliders, and french onion soup. The duck sliders were okay. I took the onion, cilantro, jalapeno off because I don't like them. We also asked for the spicy mayo sauce to be on the side. Good thing we asked if it came with a sauce since it didnt' say on the menu. If your familiar with those pork buns you can get at he Asian Bakeries for $2, that's pretty much what it tasted like. Good but not worth $12. My boyfriend at the sandwich with the condiments on it and said that it didn't go well together at all. The chips are those kinds you get at the fair. However, just looking at them, you can tell that they were drenched in the cooking oil. They were so soggy and flimsy. How did the cook see that and think it looked appetizing? Another person got the duck sliders which came out 15 minutes later for some reason and the chips were just as soggy. Our meals didn't really come out at the same time but I guess I'd rather get it right away than have it sitting under a heat lamp. The fries that come with the burger are similar to those from Steak and Shake (thin-cut/shoe string fries). Those were probably the best thing out of the whole meal. I was told that the burgers were good. Our lemon chicken was horrible. I've never had to return something back to the kitchen before but it just wasn't good and not worth $20. It was really sour (not sweet and sour, just sour) and the chicken was really rubbery. The chicken was in little strips, I was expecting an actual piece of chicken breast that you usually get at restaurants.\n\nOur drinks sometimes went empty but other than that our waiter was really nice and accommodating. He didn't question that the monkey bread was raw or that we didn't like our dish. \n\nI don't think any of us will ever go back. There are just too many other options in Old Town that are so much better. What a shame.\n\nGot a message from Jake J. probably someone who has a share in the restaurant since he posted those professional photos. An average diner wouldn't have access to those. Here's what he's got to say: \""Got love the complainers. They always have yelp accounts. I had to write once I saw your review. Monkey bread is my favorite and it is not raw in the middle it is melted cheese. Figured you would know that with your advanced pallet or see it with your own eyes. Can't please everyone. Ive been there so many times never had one complaint nor heard one around me until this stupid site that have so called \""wanna be food critics\"" didn't momma teach u anything..... If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. Guess not. Typical \""yelper\""\"" Funny because he has written unfavorable reviews in the past, some even promoting Sevens'. Some people are silly."
3,"Yes the wait is pretty outrageous but so well worth it at the end. Waited about an hour to be seated but during the wait decided to grab a few drinks with the bf to \""kill\"" time. I ordered the combo pan roast and the bf and brother both had the lobster pan roast. Food  came out AMAZING! The taste of each bite had me keep going and going. Brother and bf were both surprised of how much I ate since I normally don't eat so much. I couldn't stop myself...which I paid the the price for later lol! Don't let the wait time discourage you! well worth every minute. I still don't understand why they don't increase staff? One cook and one hostess/busser/server?? Hmmm doesn't quite add up with the number of customers coming in."
1,Food was bland and not very good.  Didnt even have any hot sauce.  Place could use an update on the decor as well...
2,"Southwest flights are plentiful on the West Coast, though Phoenix is not the typical stop or layover that you would expect on the way to the East Coast.  Nonetheless, it's still a typical Southwest flight, good service and very efficient."
0,Very bad service. They don't show up and are difficult to reach. Do not risk using these for your pool !
1,"I went there with a friend for some girl time a few weeks ago, and neither of us were very impressed. \n\nPedicure prices were average, and my pedicure was nice, but when I got ready to do the manicure I felt it was over priced, and I felt like I was being shoved out of the door. \n\nI asked for a french manicure with dark purple/gold instead of the standard clear/white, and was basically told that they didn't want to do that. I them asked for gels instead, and the person AGAIN said that they didn't want to. Finally I just got a plain color on my nails. The person left me to dry, never came back, and had someone ELSE come up and tell me that they were done. And that person didn't even say anything other than \""You can leave now\"". It was rather rude, but I chalked it up to a possible language/cultural barrier. \n\nMy friend got a french manicure, and they put gels on when she didn't *ask* for gels, AND they charged her for it. Her french tips didn't look right either, and my nail polish literally chipped the next day. I could do that myself WITHOUT paying $20 for it!"
4,"What a downtown coffee house should be; taking themselves a little too serious without attitude. The ambiance might be a little loud for some; when weather permits, great little patio area outside. \n\nHave yet to be disappointed with the coffee/food. Go there a few times and you start feeling like you walked into your own kitchen. If you cook great pastries, and had several tables....and ran a coffee house in your kitchen. You get the idea."
3,"Ok, this rating is for the bar and not the restaurant - and we also had no rum. But if you like to chill out, watch people, be they other patrons or the dancers on the overhead walkways, this place isn't all that bad. Drinks were decent, too."
1,"For the amazing location this place has, and the number of tables full, I had high expectations.  However, I thought the food here was just ok.  The staff was very friendly and the menu had plenty of what looked like great selections, but when my food arrived, I was disappointed.\n\nMy \""breakfast potatoes\"" were dry, and a bit tough.  It's like they'd been baked, then fried.  Whatever it was, the texture was all wrong.  My egg dish was bland and a bit watery from the veggies in it.  It just created a kind of soup in the bottom of the dish, not very appealing.  My meal wasn't very hot, and even the toast seemed off, like the bread was already slightly stale.\n\nThe coffee was good and the prices weren't bad, but in search of breakfast, I'll keep searching.  This place just didn't do it for me."
2,I recently attended the high school regional basketball game at TWC Areana.  Pretty good view from upper level.  Sound quality was good.  The show of the game on the large teletron was great for the replays of some great dunks and other plays.  I will have to return again for a concert or when the b-ball season begins next year.
0,"Extremely disappointed. Made reses months ago asking for a room with a view for my husbands birthday. We've never been to Vegas and this was his choice. Not only did they in no way accommodate us, but the room we got backs up to a wall. I feel as if I'm in a dungeon. What's the point of asking for a view of the strip if they don't care."
3,"My Taco Bell fix before or  after Golf @ Tuscany. Nice  location only negative is it is a little hard to get into, not real hard but wish it was easier."
0,"I give this hotel 1/2 star because the 80's TV worked.  Non smoking room with an ashtray!   Smelled like a combination of smoke , dirt and urine.  The heater doesn't work, just blows cold.  Beds very hard and lumpy, sheets stinky.  daughter who can sleep anywhere,  asked to sleep in the car."
1,"The furniture was nice, but I didn't get a welcoming vibe in here at all. First of all, it smells like a dead cat in there -- perhaps it's the mid-century furniture, but whatever, light some incense or something. Second, the guy working there was completely cold. No hello, no how are you, no welcome. He just stared us down the entire time, not saying a word, making sure we didn't touch anything at all. It's a frickin' furniture store! How can you not be allowed to sit on the couches? I don't care if they're vintage or antiques or the like, it's not getting my business."
2,"I stumbled upon this place on my while looking for a place to work on my last trip to Madison.  I went in without knowing that the place only accepted cash, had no wifi or power outlets and did not allow users to use their cell phone.  While the lack of these amenities was inconvenient for the fact that I was specifically looking for somewhere to work, I was able to able to overcome most of this place's quirks (the barista told me to just get cash and pay later, I had my own mobile wifi hotspot and they let me use a power outlet) and was happy to stay there. \n\nHOWEVER, things later turned sour when I found out about their cell phone policy.  As I was sitting by the window, by myself, and there were other people around talking and the music playing in the background I received a phone call.  Immediately after I picked up the phone, the male barista (I think his name is Matt) scrambled to get his little no-cell-phone sign and very rudely flashed it within a couple of inches from my face while telling me that they did not allow cell phones in the place, which made me feel really disrespected.\n\nWhile I do not have anything against them having this policy, I think that he could have told me about this policy in a more respectful away.  Again, the place was not quiet, I was not bothering anyone and so I think that it would have been reasonable for Matt to let me finish my (brief) phone call and then explain me their policy in a manner that was not so rude.  \n\nIf these guys are going to be so anal about the cell phone usage, they should put a huge sign at the front door explaining this policy and try to not be so uptight, especially if they are trying to create an atmosphere that encourages human interaction."
4,"Cronetto? Yes, please! I got to try two variations of this Italian \""cronut\"" - original custard and then Nutella which was flavor of the week (I think). These were my first cronuts, but they were amazing....everything I imagine a cronut should be - sweet, flaky,  light yet indulgent. I could eat one every day!\n\nWe also tried custard donuts and macarons. The donut was filled to the brim with custard - a perfect (if naughty) breakfast. The macarons were delicate and crumbly when bitten. I'm not a macaron expert, but they would good - the only quibble would be that they were inconsistent size-wise."
2,"Bought a pair of sunglasses in here - the employees were non-existent, and then were too busy calling each other \""douchebag\"" and \""bitchboy\"" to help me much.  Finally got out of there with a very expensive pair (of sunglasses)."
3,"This is a really nice area for taking pictures (a must see place if you haven't been here yet). They change the decorations according to the season and it seems like they go all out (it is Bellagio afterall). There is usually a large crowd of people here so you need to be patient and work your way through to get a decent picture. The Cafe and Michael Mina's restaurant are also located in this area.\n\nDecorations I have seen (I'll start with the most recent since I do not remember the past ones).\n\n-Winter (2012): Polar bears, a giant Christmas tree (see the picture I took), nutcracker soldiers, mini village with a moving train, white trees, and much more!\n\n---\n\nRecommendation: Check this place out during each of the different seasons! It's nice to see what kind of decorations they will put up. Be sure to bring a nice camera if you can, it will be worth it!\n\n---"
3,"Honestly, I was willing to pass Madame Tussauds because of the high admission prices.  However, SOMEHOW, we ended up with discounted coupons and the four of us were able to go.\n\nIt was very impressive, seeing all these wax models of celebrities.  \nI did not, however, go through the haunted scary mansion.  That's not me, sorry.\n\nMy sister's boyfriend participated in the American Idol part of the museum.  They recorded his 'audition' of \""Let's Get It On\"" and the judge, Simon shared his two cents.\n\nWe took a picture with Obama and made a $15 purchase of the photo.  It was a bit pricey... but then again, its vacation, so what the heck."
0,If you want to wait in line for horrible overpriced food and bad service here is the place. Do not go here.
0,"Food was worse than cheap Chinese takeout... And the price is around 15-30 a dish.   I felt cheated after eating tasteless, salty food and dropping 100 that should have costed us 20 tops with better food.  Service... We had to ask like 5 times before they came to take order.  Nobody came to ask if we needed water until our first order came like 10 mins before everybody else's order and appetizer came with rest of other others..."
2,"I was in Las Vegas a few weeks ago with my business partner and was meeting an associate of ours for dinner. Being a big fan of all of Gordon Ramsay's TV shows I thought it would be an amazing idea to take them and their wives to Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris Hotel. Based on the standard of excellence I see on his TV shows, I expected much more. At first, the service was good. Food was explained. Each cut of steak was displayed and we all decided on our meals. I ordered French Onion soup as my appetizer and i ordered Pork Belly as my meal. Two of us ordered the Waygu Rib Cap and the other two ordered Fillet. We shared the following sides: Baked Potato, Brussel Sprouts, Beet Salad, Foie Gras. \n\nThe consensus was that the best thing we ate was the Loaded Baked Potato. The other sides were good as well. Steaks were OK, but overcooked.\n\nAfter we ordered we didn't get any service. Our waiter ignored us from that point forward. We were never asked how our food was. If so, we could have told them the meat was overcooked.\n\nOnce we were done we sat with empty plates in front of us for at least 15 minutes. I know it's fine dining and it isn't supposes to be \""Fast,\"" but we had bussers and waiters walk by us many times without even asking if we wanted our table cleared. We weren't wanting to leave, but we didn't want empty plates in front of us either.\n\nI don't think I would go back. I would simply head over to the Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian where the service has been exceptional."
2,"So-so buffet. Cheap, but you get what you pay for, I guess.\n\nWe went for lunch and the food selection was fair. Not amazing or anything, but it was ok.\n\nThe wait staff was super nice and were totally entertained by my 9 month old son. I guess that's a plus. :)"
2,"I'm going to be honest: I come here whenever I can't think of anything to eat. It's automatic. \""I'm hungry. Where to go... Ah, Fat Dumpling.\"" The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the service which usually takes forever.\n\nAs for the food -- well, it's comfort food. I think they give the right amount of serving for the price they offer and the taste is good enough for me to eat as much as 10 dumplings in one sitting (which is a lot for a tiny Asian girl like me). I usually get the pork and cabbage dumplings and veggie steamed buns and dip them like crazy in a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar. Yum.\n\nTheir selection of drinks is okay as well. They're all in the same price range as other Boba places but the real winner is that they serve super fresh fruit smoothies. Now, this is just me being nitpicky, but I also wish they served Jasmine Tea with milk and Boba, too. Or just Jasmine tea itself with lychee syrup. That tastes bomb.\n\nI don't think I'll ever stop coming to this place (bonus points since it's beside my favourite Korean cosmetics store!). I just really hope they improve on their service."
0,Tr\u00e8s ordinaire un paquet d'\u00e9pice servie dans une assiette rien de gastronomique! Une chance j'avais une bouteille de vin pour faire passer \u00e7a !
1,"Someone please help this location... The staff is undertrained,they are out of key items and supplies  and they cannot keep up with the demands of a busy  location. Fortunately they are nice which eases the annoyances of long waits and other issues."
2,"If Star of India (SoI) is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare. \n\nLike many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. \n\nExperiences with the order could be as follows: \nGobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. \nLamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. \nChicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. \nDisheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. \n\nFinally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost."
3,"Have been coming here for about 4 years.  The food has always been delicious.  Our personal favorites are the Butter Lettuce Wedge, the 16th Street Beef Short Rib, the Smoked Baby Back Ribs, the Rose Lane Chicken and the Turkey Reuben.  Their croissant bread pudding is also one of the best desserts I've ever had.  The service can be hit or miss, but we've never had any major issues.    I feel like a restaurant really needs to be perfect to get 5 stars.  I would say this is more of a 4.4 star review.  They are consistently very good.  It also pays to get on their email list for free appetizers and desserts."
3,"I loved this place, I am not one of the many Yelpers from Toronto who are apparently spoiled so if your do not fall in that category you may love this as much as I do. Fantastic pork buns and lots of enjoyable side dishes. We had some kind of coconut pastry that was fantastic. It was a little much as it is extremely loud and busy as you have people just rolling around it carts to serve food.\n\nMy husband has never been to any type of Chinatown or anything of that nature so he was pretty surprised by what this place was like it was a little overwhelming for him so maybe a good thing to keep in mind. Would come back here in a heartbeat makes a fun Sunday brunch."
0,"Great decoration, the gold fishes in the huge tanks in the entry are really cool. The cool playing with his noodles is great animation. \nBUT when it comes to the food, it's not the same story maybe it was too \""Chinese food\"" for us. \nHubby took roasted duck, but there was not much meat but lots of bones to chew on. \nDaughter took a slightly spicy (they say) beef with hand pull noodles that burned her mouth. \nI was luck with the safe chicken and mushrooms and hand pull noodles. \n\nBasically, we will not come back never ever! \n\nTake pictures, but go eat somewhere else."
4,"My son dragged me into the House of Blues for lunch inside the Mandalay Bay. In the beginning, I was leary. But from the start, our waitress was right on spot. Very attentive and friendly. I ordered the 1/2 slab of ribs with vegetables and sweet potato fries and added the House of Blues salad on the side for just $4.00 more. When the salad arrived at the table, it was enormous. Could have easily been a meal itself. I shared some with the family, and they loved it so much, they all ordered one for themselves as well. The sweet potato fries were the best I've tasted. Mixed vegetables were green beans, snap peas, and asparagus sauteed. The ribs were St Louis style and just right. Happily surprised and will now make sure I visit the Vegas House of Blues for lunch on my next trip."
1,"The ONLY thing that deserves the second star is the view.\n\nThe food is crappy. That's it. Cheap food prepared poorly. I think I've experienced better flavor at Taco Bell.\nThe cheese plate? What a joke, 4 crackers with some room temp Walmart cheese.\nDrinks? Overpriced and over-poured.\nAmbiance? It's just weird...I felt like I was in a dungeon. \n\nIt's safe to say that I will never be returning."
3,"So much freakin food!!  My advice to you would be to enjoy the wonderful bread and oil they serve, just order the entree and you'd be full enough.  We for some reason opted for an appetizer along with soup (soup was the killer!) we were SOOOO full by the time the entrees came we just boxed it up and ate it the next day.  Still good though.  Definitely the best Italian chain restaurant I've ever been to."
3,"Tried this for the first time with a Groupon after noticing my hair thinning and having scalp irritation (from all the years of chemicals and chemical laden products I wondered). \n\nI got a little turned around finding the location (at Scottsdale Rd, Highland is actually north of Camelback, not South as it is in other parts of Phoenix), but once there and managing 2 sets of stairs (one I could have avoided with the elevator, but did not know that at the time), I found the desk and was greeted kindly.\n\nI found the staff to be easy to relate to and they seemed genuinely interested in my experience.  \n\nUnfortunately, I did not especially like the color that we chose to try for me on this first trip. I always have had trouble selecting from one of those \""color cards\"", as my hair has a lot of red in it and tends to look brassy unless special care is taken. It is also difficult after seeing the same stylist for decades to try and change and get it all right in one try.\n\nI did purchase some products and will try those and hope they are better for me, scalp and skin for the long run. \n\nI will return and try a different color (or maybe a mix of colors?) or some highlights and base color? to try and get the right outcome.\n\nI will say my scalp was not as irritated as with my old stylist and so far the products seek okay (if not better than the very pricey Christina Moss organic products I purchased online and tried and liked)."
3,"Shelter work damned hard at what they do, and as such I tip my hat towards them.\n\nThis particular branch of the charities chain of shops always seems to have people in, browsing the stuff that is for sale. This of course ranges from the obligatory books and junk to a large selection of clothing and shoes - not bad at all.\n\nStaff are friendly, which is nice as my experience of charity shop staff is that they are a bit moody and pushy - but that certainly isnt the case for Shelter."
2,"Had breakfast here during a recent stay at the Rio- all around good food, huge portions! I ordered the HH original benedict, which was pretty good- but it kinda threw me off. The description said something about a creamy pepper sauce on top. When it was served to me it looked like spaghetti sauce (not exactly what I was expecting!). Once I scraped off a majority of the sauce it was pretty good, but I would not order that benedict again. If you are hungover or just want a big satisfying breakfast this is the best place to go in the Rio."
3,"Enjoy the \""art house\"" feel and quirky aesthetic. People are interesting too. Love the name. Hate the metered street parking."
1,"Nothing worse than spending too much money on food and regretting it before you leave your seat.$40 for lunch ,for an app and a lunch plate. I don't mind spending forty bucks, but never have I regretted it as much as there. \n\n Overdressed salad and dry chicken. Was hungry an hour later. I've had better room service food at a 3 star hotel.\n\nNormally, I would not complain,as everything is expensive in Vegas. But it was lackluster enough to prompt me to return home and write this review 2 days later.\n\nNot good."
1,"My wife and I visited Las Vegas over Memorial Day weekend. We wanted to stay at the El Cortez, but when we were making reservations we saw that they started charging a Resort Fee/Amenity Fee. This was a deal breaker for us. As much gambling as we do, we do not believe in resort fees. We go to Vegas strictly for gambling and we used to stay here and never leave. This time we stayed at the Four Queens because they do not believe in this \""resort fee\"" garbage. We did visit the El Cortez one day for about an hour to gamble. The staff were friendly as always and the games were good. However, we did most of our playing at our own hotel because of the convenience. If the El Cortez ever stops charging resort/amanity fees, we will definitely visit again. If not, then we probably won't."
1,"I recently went with my two favorite guys to the Original Pancake House on a Sunday morning. \n\nWe showed up at around 11am and were able to park without a problem. The parking lot is very small, but on our trip only 3 other cars were there.\n\nWe immediately noticed the \""cash only\"" sign on the door. What kind of place still takes cash only? Especially in Scottsdale, next to the Fashion center, and it's a place that charges $10 for pancakes????\n\nFortunately there is a cash machine across the street. Once we got our cash we were able to get a table without waiting. I guess that should have been our clue to what type of food/service we were going to receive.\n\nAfter looking for over 7 years in Arizona for a breakfast place that serves potato pancakes and dutch pancakes I was pretty excited about trying this place out. The ambiance in this place leaves much to be desired, but I wasn't going to complain if the food was good.\n\nWell, the food and service definitely weren't good.....\nOur server came to take our order, and it was clear she didn't speak any English. Luckily, one of my guys speaks Spanish and was able to relay our order. \n\nWe ordered the Dutch Baby, an order of Potato pancakes, a Cheese omelet, and 3 diet cokes.\n\nI nearly laughed when they brought us 3 cans of soda and a glass of ice cubes. What kind of place doesn't have a soda machine? And secondly, you get no refills. Bad news for someone who drinks 15+ glasses of diet coke while eating out like my friend does! (He makes sure to get his moneys worth!).\n\nWe waited nearly an hour for our food. When it finally came it was clear that they had timed our order wrong and put all our food in at the same time. The omelet was ice cold, the pancakes were soggy, the dutch baby was pipping hot. Hmmm.....\nOur waitress?? No where to be found.\n\nWe decided to just eat our food. The omelet was probably the best of what was offered, even though it was ice cold. There was a good amount of cheese, and it was a large portion. It also came with a side of pancakes, which were ok, but really just average pancakes. Not too much different from Denny's. Certainly not what you would expect from a restaurant named \""Original Pancake House\"".\n\nThe potato pancakes were dismal. Soggy, sad, little things that made me nearly cry for my old Minnesota breakfast hangouts. The applesauce was muscleman's brand, which seemed to cheapen the pancakes even more.\n\nThe dutch baby, which I had been so excited about was an eggy mess. Dutch pancakes are usually served while still puffy, this one had fell flat 5 minutes ago. It said on the menu it would come with a lemon butter side. I was served butter in a dish and a slice of lemon. Very disappointing.\n\nOver all, the breakfast wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was just ok. I realize my expectations were very high. I wouldn't go again, and I wouldn't recommend it. I guess if you are staying at the attached Motel 6 it would probably be a good choice for a quick, filling meal.\n\nIf you are looking for a better quality breakfast I would recommend Butterfield's. More ambiance, much better food, the take credit cards, and the prices are much more reasonable."
3,Stayed here for the weekend on a Staycation with my husband. Great rooms. Lots of resturaunts to choose from with great variety. All the resturaunts give u A LOT of food. Great price plus gift shops and free tower admission. Would definetly recommend and be staying again.
1,"From it's outward appearance you wouldn't think Monte Carlo was too bad, that's what I thought too until we stayed here on our last Vegas trip. This place is crap. Seriously, comparable to a Motel 6. Do yourself a favor and just pay a couple extra bucks for a better hotel (it'll make your experience a lot better)\n\nThe concierge wasn't very friendly or helpful (they were downright rude) and the staff took FOREVER to get us a couple extra towels for the room (we had 3 ppl per room, and they only stocked the room with 2 sets of towels). They refused to let us switch rooms and didn't give us 2 rooms next to each other with the adjoining door (blah blah blah, something about how they were all booked up and only had smoking rooms left, which I seriously doubt because the walls are paper thin and the room next door seemed empty). When I say paper thin, I mean it. You can seriously hear the people talking next door. Talk about lack of privacy. No wonder security had to come to our door since we were talking a little louder than usual that we were disturbing our neighbors... \n\nNot only did everything look super-outdated (they didn't even have a mini-fridge (WTH? don't they want to make extra money off of you?), but our bathroom shower didn't function properly. The pull thing for the shower wouldn't lift up all the way, so when you were taking a shower, the water from the bottom (for the tub) runs also, so you can only get like a half shower/half bath. WOW right? \n\nIf you have any other choice available, don't stay here. It's not even THAT CHEAP for what you're getting. Definitely wasn't worth it."
4,We sat at the bar to watch Kansas beat Ohio and were treated to a royal show by our rockstar bartender Aaron.  The food was so amazing we returned the next day for your last dinner together for our trip to Arizona.
0,Their expertise consist of a former web designer. Great if your looking for a website--If not RUN this place has horrible management! And the prices....well just call and find out for yourself!
1,"I am going to break the hearts and minds of many as I write this review. \n\nChide as you must - I speak only the truth. \n\nI will first admit that I am far closer to the classless slob end of the spectrum than an appreciator of fine cuisine...\n\nI will second admit that I came here on a 'pay what you like' night so I may have never ventured in here otherwise...\n\nI will third admit that half the reason my experience was so shit was because everyone else was dying over their food saying it was the greatest thing they had ever tasted...\n\nI will fourth admit that I am a vegetarian, so I have zero opinion of the duck or the quail or the lamb or whatever...\n\nI will fifth admit that I had no idea what spelt was when I ordered it (not that I really had any choice, this was the only vegetarian option)\n\nI will sixth admit that the desserts were more than five stars... \n\nNow that I have explained all the reasoning behind my opinion really not mattering to you on the topic - I shall give you my opinion. \n\nSeriously? A fucking FIVE STAR restaurant that gets nothing but amazing perfect rave reviews doesn't have anything brilliant and special to offer a non-meat eater in 2012, in a fairly hip city in Europe? \n\nWas it horrendous? No. \nWas it better than a cheese and onion sandwich from Tesco... JUST. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty standard to make sure there's a couple of decent options for veggies on the menu and this place didn't, at all. \n\nNot to mention the ONE option wasn't even an option at all, it was an appetizer turned meal. \n\nMaybe having one option would have been fine if it wasn't so obvious that no one gave a shit about that option (and in turn in my mind people who don't eat meat) and the duck was going to be perfection defined.\nThe quail was going to make you orgasm with joy. \nThe lamb was going to melt in your mouth.\nThe steak was going to be heaven on a fork.\n\nAnd the spelt was ALWAYS going to be crap in comparison. \n\nThe dessert made up for it being the worst meal ever... but not enough."
3,"Just the way I remember the curry houses in Japan.  An intimate setting with name your spice level.  Even with the expanded dinning room the chef is no further away than a dinner party at home.  If curry is not your thing you won't find alternatives. The menu is just straight to the point.  Having said the 8 year old in our dinning party was quite content with the chicken cutlet and rice, hold the sauce.  Go figure.  My pork cutlet level 4, met my curry craving with high marks. Now to work my way up the ladder of heat. 1-9.  A 4 got my nose running lol.  2-3 level should be fine for medium fans.  The staff said the difference between 4 and 5 is more than the other steps.  I'll bring some tissue and take them up on that on the next visit."
0,"This place never fails at being just terrible. Don't get me wrong, love the mojitos, but dang is the service just BAD. I always try to give it the benefit of the doubt thinking that they have GOT to have things figured out by now, but I am always wrong. Always. \n\nShall I explain why? Oh ok, if you insist. \n\nOne of the first times I was there, I ordered a salad. Waited 10 min for silverware. 2 of the MAIN ingredients were not present (pomegranates and avocado) . When I asked why they said they were out of pomegranates, and didn't know why the avocado wasn't on it. So they bring me the avocado, and might I add that it was 10 minutes AFTER I finished the wimpy salad. When I get my bill, guess what I was charged for...A SIDE OF AVOCADO. I voiced my issues to my server, and then never saw him again. Then drinks took forever, when it was not even busy. I just had it. I have never been so baffled with the service at a restaurant so I asked to speak to the manager just simply to tell him how things were going so he was aware of how things were being handled. Let's just say he wasn't good with constructive confrontation. \n\nWent there the other day and had the same lousy experience. BUT I do want to say that our server JAMILA was really nice and on top of things for our table. \n\nJust a few side notes of things that surprised me. \n\n1. 3 dollars for ROX. \n2. Signage of deals for the day/hour are not clear. \n3. The amount of ice they crush into the glass is very overwhelming. We ordered the buckets and it was all ice! I was bummed with how much of a buzz I didn't experience."
3,Must visit while in Las vegas!  Foods proportions are ginormous! And the price is great.  Only 4* because the food is kind of bland.
1,"I was really excited to try Rice Paper. I had lunch there yesterday and was very disappointed. I started with a chicken spring roll, and the chicken was so over-cooked (fried) that it was leathery and even crunchy. Not a good texture with a spring roll, which fell apart as I tried to pry off bites. My bowl of chicken pho took 30 minutes to come and the restaurant was less than half full. Pho was okay, but on the salty side. Ambience was not enough. Found myself craving Maxim's."
2,I got the vegetarian Spanish omelette.  Side with a slice of watermelon and home potatoes.  Oh my. My potatoes were super dry.  I drenched themnin hot sauce and ketchup. \nMy sissy hash brown were so soft and soggy.  Didn't look appetizing at all. She sent it back...... came back with a whole new batch of hash browns. Um yeah... same texture.  Same problem..  I guess that's how they make their hash browns. :(
4,"My family and I were on a weekend vacation from SoCal- my wife and I are originally from Oahu Hi - it's so hard to find Real Hawaiian style food where we live, made by real Hawaiian folks that were raised there so they know what the food is supposed to taste like- a local couple told us to come here and so we did and Wow!!! ...I'm soooo happy to have real Poke from folks that are FROM Hawaii!!! It makes such a difference! We also had local food from the restaurant part and it was super Ono!!! The good folks that work there are super nice and have real Aloha - We can't wait to come back!"
3,This casino is just steps away from my house so thats 3 stars already lol. I dont come here often because when I travel to Vegas I rather go to the strip and walk around but my parents like to gamble at the slot machines so they like it here. Get a rewards card to get discounts for the buffet. The additional star is for the ambiance and the cleanliness of the restrooms and the casino itself. . . .
0,"This was my first Gyro experience; I wasn't impressed. Since then I've had better Gyros. I don't know what it was, but it just wasn't good."
4,If you like craft beer and better than average bar food then this place is perfect!\n\nIt's on the second level of the building and you can see Camelback Mountain from the bar and front patio.\n\nThe service is great and all the employees really know about craft beer.  I had a Racer X IPA that I had never tried before and it was wonderful.  I also had a rich and creamy Avery Czar Imperial Stout that was awesome.\n\nThe Ivan burger is as good as the hype.  They also double fry their french fries to make them extra crispy the way I like them!\n\nThe Attic really does a great job and I can't wait to come back soon.
0,"They don't deserve to use the words \""dim sum\"" in their name!!  This is not a dim sum place at all!!  A few dim sum items under the appetizer section of their menu does not do it!!  Who ever heard of $18 for a bowl of pho?!!  We didn't order that but wanted to note how ridiculous that was - only in Vegas, I guess!!  We had their wonton noodle soup, which was $12, and not spectacular!  We ordered the hau gow and sue mai just to try it and it was dry and not worth it at all!!  The service was super slow and the servers all looked miserable!  Worse place ever, not worth a dime!!!"
1,"2.5 Stars\n\nDillard's at the Desert Sky Mall may not be the best store in the fleet, but it serves a purpose for me.  This red headed step-child store lacks inventory compared to other stores.  This store is pretty close to my house and can always find my Clinique products without a long trek to the bigger Dillard's.  This store is also the store where I make my returns.  \n\nI understand the changing climate of this mall will ultimately force Dillard's out, but hope that the huge Litchfield Park mall is finally built and will most likely house a state of the art Dillard's.  Until then, how about sprucing up this Dillard's which is in desperate need of it!  The clientele at this mall may not support this store financially but a remodel will attract folks who would normally drive up to Arrowhead Mall."
4,"Fantastic food, fantastic staff, and fantastic decor.\n\nI was really surprised when we walked in and there was no one there but us the whole time, but...we were there around 3:30 for a late lunch/early dinner, and they were setting up for two big parties. \n\nWe sat down and took in the very cozy decor, all antiques which I am in love with. Our waiter was great, as well as another employee who came by and apologized for the noise (which none of really noticed) as they were setting up tables for the parties that were coming in later on in the evening.\n\nTwo of us started off with a Samuel Smith Organic Cider, and Hummus with warm Pita bread, which was great. I ended up getting the Penne Gorgonzola...what sold me on my choice? In the description it said...'Blue Cheese lovers unit' Hands down possibly the best pasta I've gotten from a restaurant ever. Tasted very authentic, and very fresh. \n\nWe ended our meal by splitting the Pumpkin Cheesecake...to die for, really. \n\nEverything I ate here, and experience at Bunky's is all hands down great. Can't wait to stop in again."
4,"I love going to the drive in! Its so fun and cheep! Plus you get to see 2 movies for the price of one and there not crap movies. We like to back our truck up, open the back, put all of the food and drinks out and then sit on lawn chairs. The kid(s) can stand up and stretch and have a great time. \n\nThere is a concision stand where you can buy food, candy and drink if you forgot stuff, but bring your own if you can. Also bring a little boom box for the radio station so you don't have to waste the battery in your car. We saw some people having to get jumped the last time we where there because they had their car radio on for like 4 hrs and it died. \n\nGo give it a try its really fun and worth the $6 to get in!"
2,I want to give this place another try due to the reviews. I got the fish tacos and the fish was not de-boned making the whole taco disappointing. I will try the pasties next time I think since they look amazing.
4,"No one comes close to the talent and customer service of Europin Tailor.. I was saddened and surprised to read a few reviews less than 5 stars.. Alma is not only an excellent tailor, but her suggestions regarding how to tweak a design are brilliant.. Her husband could be the nicest human on the planet .. I take that back, both of them are the nicest people on the planet!\nI sent a very picky friend there to see what she thought.. She called me from her car as she was leaving to tell me she'll never go anywhere else.. They deserve 5 stars without question.."
2,"Came here on a Friday night with a few friends and my amazing girlfriend.  I expected it to be a little busy so it's not a big deal.  I was a little disappointed with service at the table as we had to actually flag a barback down and ask him to send a waiter/waitress over to take our drink and food order. I don't fault the girl for it being her first week, she really went above and beyond to try and take care of us. However, when the \""experienced\"" girl came on, she was not the friendliest out there. She came by and asked us if we needed any more drinks and left before we could answer. The food was good, just got the chicken fingers, but this is a service industry and I pay for the experience, which just wasn't there."
1,"Good food again this time. Lunch menu has a nice selection of sandwich options, unlike the dinner menu. Service -- by Edie -- was excellent. We won't be back, though, during a sport event because of the noise. A very pleasant afternoon meal and conversation was abruptly ruined by a blasting TV. To be fair, they promote themselves as a sports bar, but when there aren't football games on the telly, the place is quite inviting."
3,"This review is for the Honeymoon Suite at the Albany Boutique Hotel.\n\nThat's right - the Honeymoon Suite. Now, I know what you're thinking - how did that ugly guy, with no personality and as boring as a drying paint wall manage to get hitched? Well fear not, I stayed alone in the Honeymoon Suite.\n\nWhy? Because I can. That's why.\n\nI had a night to spare in Edinburgh and whilst looking for a room for the night online, I chanced upon the Albany Hotel, and saw the Honeymoon Suite was going for \u00a399 for the night. Compared to other rooms in Scotland's finest city, this was a complete steal.\n\nCheck in was pretty straight forward, though I notice they charged my card prior to arrival, not giving me an option to pay by cash. No biggie, but that's different to other hotels I've booked into.\n\nThe room itself is brilliant - the carpets are black, thick and soft, and the room decor is masculine modern - a huge king side bed dominates one side of the room, and the other side has a 50\"" TV screen, and a huge black sofa with high edges. In the en suite, there's a full size free standing bathtub, complete with an attached TV (which I couldn't get to work, but again, I wasn't too fussed about that) and a separate shower cubicle.\n\nThe hotel is a stone throw from York Place tram stop (on the newly opened Edinburgh tram line) which makes it very convenient to reach and get around, though walking to the city centre only took me a mere 15 minutes or so.\n\nI've given the hotel 4/5 stars, based mostly on the Honeymoon Suite, and how nice it was. However, judging by what I saw of some of the other rooms (whilst they were being cleaned) and the general state of the hotel (frayed carpets, small breakfast room, awkward stairs, no lift and nobody offering to carry my luggage), if I were staying in one of the other rooms, I'd probably have gone for a 2/5. So be warned that this is a skewed review, as I'm only recommending the Honeymoon Suite.\n\nThe breakfast provided in the hotel is a Continental breakfast buffet, which left a lot to be desired. Cereal boxes, some cold meats and pastries - how boring.\n\nNevertheless, I would definitely stay again in the Albany Hotel.. but only in the Honeymoon Suite."
3,"Our only complaint was the noise level.  Other than that service was relaxed.  Arancini app was awesome, so was eggplant app.  Veal Milanese did not diss appoint."
1,"Good dessert, but not worth the hype or the price. Plus this was the 3rd time we had tried to go, but got held up the other two due to crowds and horrible hosts at the door...this time we were finally able to get in. Overall not a fan."
1,"I have lived near this place for 6 years and my favorite place is closed on Mondays, so we decided to give this a go.  I was really after chirashizushi and really, you can tell a lot about a sushi place by it's sashimi presentation.  First of all it was overpriced at 19.99.  I convinced myself that if it was good, it would be worth it.  There were 2 of us and normally, I would eat the chirashi by myself, but it also normally comes as 2 pieces of several varieties of fish and at least shrimp, ika and I was hoping for ikura.  This is the first time I have ordered chirashi and gotten it so far removed from it's Japanese way, that it is no longer chirashi.  The server couldn't pronounce it, when I asked her what was cut for it, I got an empty vague answer.  She had no idea.  The bowl looked like bibimbap (which is a wonderful thing, I love that, too.  but that's not what I ordered).  So, it was a stainless, covered bowl of rice.  (sans seasoning) , 2 bowls of lukewarm miso soup.  1 spicy tuna roll.  and this large bowl of cut green lettuce dressed in sesame oil, and topped with paper thin slices of salmon, tuna and\nsnapper.  The lettuce was fresh, the sesame oil inappropriate and the whole thing was covered in sesame seeds.  And the 'chef' came to the table to instruct me to add the \""chirashi sauce\"" to it.   I let him know that sauce might be for bibimbap.....and he lingered table side until I put some on my plate.   \nSo, it was as disappointing as ordering a taco and getting a burger.  \nAnd my bill was $32.00, at lunch time with waters to drink! \nThere is nothing wrong with dishing whatever floats your boat, but it's not cool to use menu names that are misleading."
2,"This place is a hidden gem. I liked this place because of the location, and I didn't have to worry about walking through noisy and smoke filled casinos.   The price is reasonable, and there is a kitchenette for leftovers and drinks.  This place would be a great place for business travelers who stay long term or for families who don't want to deal with the crowds.  \n\nI just wish that this place had a better cafe downstairs. The food was not good. They had some healthy options in the grocery section, which was great. I like how they had some gluten free options as well.  \n\nI also wish this place had a better pull out sofa. This was the worst pull out couch I've ever slept on! For that, I had to bring down the rating to a 3.  Seriously horrible.  I had pain in my back."
1,"I will say one thing about Barcelona. It is spacious, so for all the claustrophobic people out there, you'll definitely not feel like a sardine in a tin can. I love how you have your options open - if you'd like to feel the sultry summer breeze, or lack of, you can sit outside, or if you are freezing you can go to the main building, and dance your drunk ass off. Yes, the live band's slightly cheesy, but when you're inebriated, who cares? \n\nCaution, for cougar lovers, there are a lot prowling around, waiting to sink their claws in young meat. I've never had the opportunity to eat there, so I can't say anything in regards to food. This is definitely not for people who are going out, expecting to meet a ton of young people, and surround yourself with recent college graduates. Yes, there is diversity. I've seen young to extremely old. I've met my share of extremely weird characters, like this man who was trying to pull girls from the dance floor or the bar, to share the VIP experience with his son who was celebrating his birthday. It sort of felt like he was trying to pimp us out to his son, but that's a different story all together. \n\nBarcelona's is a cougar's den, and the drinks aren't satisfactory for the wallet, but I do emphasize how I love the spaciousness of this place! I suppose that's the only reason I enjoy it, anyway. I usually relax outside, and the dancing side of me doesn't come into action here. With the live band, it's hard to shake my moneymaker, anyway."
3,I always remember this place because of how pretty it looked during the time I went. They had decorations correlated to the season and their food was fantastic. The place is however a little pricey but there is a lot to choose from. They also have a place where they make desserts and make fresh crepes.
2,"The line  wasn't long but man my  grand-ma can move faster than that line, and she is dead!!!\n\nThe ride itself was great, but so short... We literally waited in line for over 2 hours for a 15 second ride.....not worth it!!\n\nWe went on a Thursday night at 9pm so we were hoping the line would not be so bad.....Like I said the zipline itself was fun, the LINE WAS NOT WORTH IT... all in all, a one-time thing for this family, unless they can figure out how to move people faster."
0,"Update: the manager Annie has yet to call me. Either Jen didn't tell her manager about her horrendous customer service skills, or Annie isn't woman enough to deal with customer complaints. Overall fail in this locations lack of care. Beware!"
1,"Bad experience. Waitress/Bartender was too busy playing on her phone, talking on her phone, and flirting with the bar patrons. We were the first lunch customers. Maybe 2 ppl at the bar. Our food sat for 5 minutes after the cook rang the \""order up\"" bell. We waited 10-15 min for our check after we finished eating. Another 10 min before she ran the credit card and brought it back. I suggest the owner/manager be more aware on worker performance and customer satisfaction. She just lost two customers for good. We have been there maybe 4 or 5 times before. However, we will not return."
4,"If you've ever thought of buying a wig you have to go here!  Sharin & Equilla were awesome!!!  When my sister & I walked in were immediately greeted with a friendly hello & were given the opportunity to look around without any high pressure.  We had so much fun trying on different styles & didn't feel like we were annoying the staff.  We had been to Serge's Wigs prior to coming to Reese's & it was not a fun experience.  Besides the fact their prices were much \n\nBoth my sister & I brought two wigs.  It takes awhile to find the right ones but with the professional help & many, many wigs later we were very happy with our choices. \nSO...once again I must say go to Reese's if you are in the market for a wig.  They make it a fun experience!"
3,"Gotta love yelp! I was searching for a new ice cream place to try that was out of our area, I felt like a little drive & this one fit the bill.  We showed up around 8pm on a Saturday & were the only people there.  They had tons of ice cream flavors as well as frozen yogurt. Loads of toppings which makes for lots of sundae & milkshake options.  I went with cotton candy & malted milk ball (weird combo, I know) & my husband got the animal circus cookie which he almost fainted when he saw (those are his FAVORITE cookies ever) Our total was $9 for my 2 small scoops & his one large scoop. Cute place, I'll be back to try some more flavors!"
