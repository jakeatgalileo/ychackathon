# Data Analyzer Web App

This application provides two main features:
1. Web page analysis - analyze content and structure of web pages
2. Kaggle dataset downloading - fetch and preview datasets from Kaggle

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Kaggle account and API credentials (for dataset downloading)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Setting up Kaggle API credentials

To use the Kaggle dataset download feature, you need to set up your Kaggle API credentials:

1. Sign up for a Kaggle account if you don't have one already at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. Go to your account settings page (click on your profile picture â†’ Account)
3. Scroll down to the "API" section and click "Create New API Token"
4. This will download a `kaggle.json` file containing your API credentials

Then, set up your credentials using ONE of the following methods:

#### Method 1: Create a .env.local file (recommended for development)

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_kaggle_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_kaggle_api_key
```

Replace `your_kaggle_username` and `your_kaggle_api_key` with the values from your `kaggle.json` file.

#### Method 2: Place kaggle.json in the .kaggle directory

On Unix-based systems (Linux/Mac):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

On Windows:
```powershell
mkdir -f "$env:USERPROFILE\.kaggle"
copy kaggle.json "$env:USERPROFILE\.kaggle\"
```
